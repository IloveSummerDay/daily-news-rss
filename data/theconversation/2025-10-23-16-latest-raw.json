Their names are called as they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Xl1f-fXLo\">circle around a ring</a> made of partially buried bales of rice straw. Turning toward the center, they clap, lift their aprons, raise their arms upward, and then exit without a word.</p>\n\n<p>Then two of those men face each other, crouching, clapping their hands together and stomping on the ground. They pause repeatedly to rinse their mouths with water and toss salt into the ring. </p>\n\n<p>Overseeing their movements is a man outfitted in a colorful kimono and a black hat resembling that of a Shinto priest and holding a tasseled fan. After a subtle gesture with his fan, they finally grapple – and only then would the uninformed observer realize that the performance was an athletic event.</p>\n\n<p>Every sport has its rituals, from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lhgJXdrWCE\">All Blacks rugby team’s pregame haka</a> to the polite handshake between victor and vanquished over the tennis court net. Some, like many sumo rituals, <a href=\"https://www.sumo.or.jp/pdf/en/sumo_introduction.pdf\">have roots in religious practices</a>. A few hundred years ago, competitions were frequently held at temples and shrines as part of festivals.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two men in white robes bow, standing on the side of a dirt ring, as another man in white robes sits between them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697677/original/file-20251022-56-likae1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sumo referees perform the Shinto ritual to purify and bless the ring ahead of a tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Oct. 15, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/BritainGrandSumo/2716b493e05040aeb7c6cdaefe449863/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Frank Augstein</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, sumo is a modern sport with records, rules and a governing institution that <a href=\"https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/special/04/4310/\">celebrated its 100th anniversary</a> in October 2025. But those religious roots are still visible. The salt the wrestlers throw, for example, is a purifying element. The clapping is a way of drawing the attention of the gods.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://asian.la.psu.edu/people/jua14/\">a historian of modern Japan</a> and a scholar of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07075332.2012.626572\">sports and diplomacy</a>, I have seen many ways in which sports are much more than “just a game.” Sport rituals are an important part of those wider meanings. In fact, sumo and its rituals have helped shape foreign perceptions of Japan for at least 170 years. </p>\n\n<h2>First impressions</h2>\n\n<p>The first sumo tournament known to have been observed by American spectators was held in March 1854, in honor of a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/spring/treaty-of-kanagawa\">treaty establishing diplomatic relations</a> between the United States and Japan. Described in the personal <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/japanexpedition10000unse\">journal kept by Commodore Matthew Perry</a>, the leader of the mission to Japan, the exhibition before gawking American sailors seemed designed to impress.</p>\n\n<p>Before the matches began, the athletes put on a performance of strength, loading the American ships with a gift of some 200 bales of rice from the Japanese government. Perry describes how two dozen huge men, “naked with the exception of a narrow girdle around the loins,” paraded before the American crew before getting to work, each shouldering two 135-pound bales.</p>\n\n<p>If the actual sumo competition was intended to inspire appreciation of Japanese culture, it backfired. Perry’s descriptions of the wrestlers were full of unflattering animal metaphors. He wrote that they resembled “stall-fed bulls” more than human beings and made noises like “dogs in combat.” </p>\n\n<p>At the time, sports as we know them today were just <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/games-and-empires/9780231100427/\">emerging in England and the United States</a>. Some of the earliest rules of soccer <a href=\"https://collections.etoncollege.com/the-origins-of-the-field-game/\">were recorded in the 1840s</a>, and baseball’s growing popularity led to the development of professional leagues after the U.S. Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>With this American idea of sports in Perry’s mind, the sumo tournament did not impress him. He called the bouts a “farce” and judged the wrestlers’ physique as one that “to our ideas of athletic qualities would seem to incapacitate him from any violent exercise.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration in muted colors shows two large men wrestling on a platform between red posts, as a large audience watches.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An illustration of an 1846 sumo tournament by Utagawa Kunisada.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grand-Kanjin-Sumo-Tournament-by-Utagawa-Kunisada-1846.png\">Chunichi.co.jp/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the mid-19th century, Japan <a href=\"https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/black_ships_and_samurai/bss_essay01.html\">was relatively isolated</a> from the Western world. Most Americans knew almost nothing about the country and considered it backward, even barbaric. The two cultures’ differing ideas of sports meant that sumo only added to American views of Japan as strange and uncivilized.</p>\n\n<h2>A competing sport</h2>\n\n<p>Sports diplomacy had a more positive impact on American views of Japan in the early 20th century, thanks to a different game: baseball.</p>\n\n<p>After the fall of the shogunate in 1868, the new Japanese government – made up of oligarchs ruling in the name of the Meiji Emperor – employed Americans to help implement reforms. Some of them brought along America’s pastime, which <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469622040/transpacific-field-of-dreams/\">became very popular</a> within a few decades. </p>\n\n<p>By the 1910s and ‘20s, Japanese college teams were regularly traveling to the U.S., where newspapers praised their skills and their sportsmanship.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo shows two rows of men in suits posing outside a large white building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Osaka Mairuchi baseball team from Japan visits the U.S. White House in 1925.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osaka_Mairuchi_baseball_team_from_Japan_at_W.H.,_(i.e.,_White_House,_Washington,_D.C.),_6-4-25_LCCN2016850451.jpg\">National Photo Company Collection/Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Some of the rituals in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-major-league-baseball-keeps-coming-back-to-japan-264668\">a Japanese baseball game</a>, like a ceremonial first pitch, were familiar to American observers. Others, like a team bow toward the umpire, were quite a contrast, but struck them as superior to the rowdiness of American players and fans. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, Japan’s Westernizing reforms and recent military victories <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Sino-Japanese-War-1894-1895\">over China</a> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War\">and Russia</a> had already improved Americans’ impressions of the country. Former baseball player <a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/harry-kingman/\">Harry Kingman</a>, writing about a game he watched during a 1927 stint coaching a Tokyo college team, explained the Japanese turn toward baseball as part of the nation’s modernization.</p>\n\n<p>Sumo, however, continued to be the most popular sport in Japan until the 1990s, when <a href=\"https://www.crs.or.jp/data/pdf/sports25.pdf\">baseball took that title</a>. But the initial popularity of this American import caused some anxiety within the sumo world: A foreign game seemed to be taking over and stealing sumo’s fans.</p>\n\n<p>Amid these changes, professional sumo’s governing institutions, which were divided into competing associations based in Tokyo and Osaka, joined forces. They officially <a href=\"https://intojapanwaraku.com/culture/281606/\">unified in 1925</a> as the organization that would become today’s Japan Sumo Association.</p>\n\n<h2>Can sumo be cool?</h2>\n\n<p>Japanese popular culture now captivates people around the world. In 2002, journalist Douglas McGray wrote about the soft power conferred by what he called the nation’s “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/3183487\">gross national cool</a>.” But he noted sumo as an exception, blaming its leadership’s insular attitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sumo’s biggest hurdle to building an international fan base is its attitude toward foreigners. Immigration is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/japan-xenophobia-immigration-sanseito-antiglobalism-trump-foreigners-358e5eb2b9d6bfe4814cac1b35557e1f\">controversial in Japan</a>. The population is relatively homogeneous, and barriers to naturalization are high.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a blue suit shakes hands with a much larger man in a gray suit.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=747&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=747&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=747&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=939&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=939&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697681/original/file-20251022-56-3oor9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=939&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Thomas Foley, then the U.S. ambassador to Japan, presents sumo grand champion Akebono with a letter of appreciation from Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2001.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/JAPANFOLEYAKEBONO/8d8174431be5da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Tsugufumi Matsumoto</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In contrast to sports like baseball, soccer and rugby, where “imported” players abound, there are few foreign sumo wrestlers, and their success seems to rankle. In 1993, a Hawaiian named Akebono became the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244509059/hawaiian-born-sumo-wrestler-taro-akebono-is-dead-at-54\">first foreigner to reach the top rank</a> of “yokozuna,” sparking a temporary hold on recruiting sumo wrestlers from outside Japan.</p>\n\n<p>Constraints were gradually softened, and the number of non-Japanese professional wrestlers <a href=\"https://sustainable.japantimes.com/magazine/vol51/51-02\">has been rising</a>. They still represent a small minority, but their success often sparks discussions about the place of foreigners in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>Though sumo has gained some traction outside of Japan, its rituals still occasionally create negative impressions of Japanese culture. At a tournament in 2018, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/asia/japan-sumo-women-ring-emergency-intl-trnd\">a local official collapsed</a> while giving a speech. Female medics who rushed to help him were told to leave the sumo ring, considered a sacred space polluted by a woman’s presence. The chairman of the Japan Sumo Association <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/4817\">later apologized</a>, but the incident brought criticism that the sumo world was clinging to anachronistic traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Sumo continues to change. A 1926 Tokyo government <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674056107\">ban on women’s sumo</a> is no longer in force, and there are now some <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2024/06/12/women-fight-for-respect-in-japans-sumo-rings\">female wrestlers in amateur clubs</a>. But women are still barred from professional competition.</p>\n\n<p>Tournaments are certainly popular with tourists, but they generally go for a one-time experience. One might ask if sumo can change enough to play an effective role in Japan’s sports diplomacy. The answer depends on whether sumo leaders are more interested in maintaining the sport’s Japanese identity or building global connections.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263093/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jessamyn R.

The answer might seem simple: virtuous actions – actions that align with morality.</p>\n\n<p>But life is more than doing. Frequently, we just think. We observe and spectate; meditate and contemplate. Life often unfolds in our heads.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://philosophy.richmond.edu/faculty/aenglert/\">a philosopher</a>, I specialize in the Enlightenment thinker <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/\">Immanuel Kant</a>, who had volumes – literally – to say about virtuous actions. What I find fascinating, however, is that Kant also believed people can think virtuously, and should.</p>\n\n<p>To do so, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">he identified three simple rules</a>, listed and explained in his 1790 book, “Critique of the Power of Judgment,” namely: Think for yourself. Think in the position of everyone else. And, finally, think in harmony with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If followed, he thought a “sensus communis,” or “communal sense,” could result, improving mutual understanding by helping people appreciate how their ideas relate to others’ ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Given our current world, with <a href=\"https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2016/\">its “post-truth” culture</a> and isolated echo chambers, I believe Kant’s lessons in virtuous thinking offer important tools today.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 1: Think for yourself</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking can be both active and passive. We can choose where to direct our attention and use reason to solve problems or consider why things happen. Still, we cannot completely control our stream of thought; feelings and ideas bubble up from influences outside our control.</p>\n\n<p>One kind of passive thinking is letting others think for us. Such passive thinking, Kant thought, was not good for anybody. When we accept someone else’s argument without a second thought, it is like handing them the wheel to think for us. But thoughts lie at the foundation of who we are and what we do, thus we should beware of abdicating control.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A formal painting of a man with a gray powdered wig, looking down and wearing a dark suit jacket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A late 18th-century portrait of Immanuel Kant, possibly by Elisabeth von Stägemann.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Immanuel_Kant_portrait_c1790.jpg\">Norwegian Digital Learning Arena via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Kant had a word for handing over the wheel: “heteronomy,” or surrendering freedom to another authority.</p>\n\n<p>For him, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511813306\">virtue depended on the opposite</a>: “autonomy,” or the ability to determine our own principles of action.</p>\n\n<p>The same principle holds true for thinking, Kant wrote. We have an obligation to take responsibility for our own thinking and to check its overarching validity and soundness.</p>\n\n<p>In Kant’s day, he was especially concerned about superstition, since it provides consoling, oversimplified answers to life’s problems.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/42425-which-superstitions-are-americans-most-likely-beli\">superstition is still widespread</a>. But many new, pernicious forms of trying to control thought now proliferate, thanks to generative artificial intelligence and the amount of time we spend online. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-generative-ai-becomes-more-sophisticated-its-harder-to-distinguish-the-real-from-the-deepfake-225768\">rise of deepfakes</a>, the use of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/generative-ai-is-most-useful-for-the-things-we-care-about-the-least-249329\">ChatGPT for creative tasks</a>, and information ecosystems that block out opposing views are but a few examples.</p>\n\n<p>Kant’s Rule 1 tells us to approach content and opinions cautiously. Healthy skepticism provides a buffer and leaves room for reflection. In short, active or autonomous thinking protects people from those who seek to think for them.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 2: Think in the position of everyone else</h2>\n\n<p>Pride often tempts us to believe that we have everything figured out. </p>\n\n<p>Rule 2 checks this pride. Kant recommends what philosophers call “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-socrates-know-nothing-wisdom-can-teach-a-polarized-america-202696\">epistemic humility</a>,” or humility about our own knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping outside our own beliefs isn’t just about opening up new perspectives. It’s also the bedrock of science, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-should-we-trust-science-because-it-doesnt-trust-itself-188988\">seeks shared agreement</a> about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-peer-review-the-role-anonymous-experts-play-in-scrutinizing-research-before-it-gets-published-258255\">what is and is not true</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you’re in a meeting and a consensus is taking shape. Strong personalities and a quorum support it, but you remain unsure.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Rule 2 does not recommend that you adopt the view of the others. Quite the opposite, in fact. If you simply accept the group’s conclusion without further thought, you’d be breaking Rule 1: Think for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Rule 2 prescribes temporarily detaching yourself from even your own way of thinking, especially your own biases. It’s an opportunity to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">think in the position of everyone else</a>.” What would a fair and discerning thinker make of this situation?</p>\n\n<p>Kant believed that, while difficult, a standpoint can be achieved in which biases all but vanish. We might notice things that we missed before. But this requires appreciating our own limitations and seeking a wider, more universal view.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Kant’s idea of virtue depends on autonomy, so Rule 2 isn’t about letting others think for us. To be responsible for how we shape the world, we must take responsibility for our own thinking, since everything flows from that point outward.</p>\n\n<p>But it emphasizes the “communal” part of the “sensus communis,” reminding us that it must be possible to share what is true.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 3: Think in harmony with yourself</h2>\n\n<p>The final rule, Kant maintained, is both the most difficult and profound. He said that it was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">the task of becoming “einstimmig</a>,” literally “of one voice” with ourselves. He also uses a related term, “konsequent” – coherent – to express the same idea.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Blue neon lights illuminate a courtyard outside a large stone building, seen at night.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697539/original/file-20251021-56-dk94wi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Immanuel Kant’s tomb at the Konigsberg Cathedral in Kaliningrad, Russia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/tomb-of-immanuel-kant-tomb-with-bright-illumination-royalty-free-image/1317137932?phrase=immanuel%20kant&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">Denis Gavrilov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To clarify, a metaphor that Kant employed can help – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09608788.2023.2293882\">namely, carpentry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Constructing a building is complex. The blueprint must be sound, the building materials must be high quality, and craftsmanship matters. If the nails are hammered sloppily or steps performed out of order, then the edifice might collapse.</p>\n\n<p>Rule 3 tells us to construct our abode of thought with the same care as when constructing a house, such that stability between the parts results. Each thought, belief and intention is a building block. To be “einstimmig” or “bündig” – to be in “harmony” – these building blocks should fit well together and support each other.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a colleague who you believe has impeccable taste. You trust his opinions. But one day, he shares his secret obsession with death metal music – a genre you dislike.</p>\n\n<p>A disharmony in thought might result. Your reaction to his love of death metal reveals a further belief: Your belief that only people with disturbed taste could love something you perceive to be so grating to the spirit. But he seems, otherwise, like such a thoughtful and pleasant person!</p>\n\n<p>Rather than immediately change your belief about him, Kant’s third rule commands you to investigate the world and your own thoughts further. Perhaps you have never listened to death metal with a discerning spirit. Maybe your original beliefs about your colleague were inaccurate. Or could it be that having good taste is more complex than you originally thought?</p>\n\n<p>Rule 3 leads us to do a system check of our mental architecture, whether we’re considering music, politics, morality or religion. And if that architecture is stable, Kant thinks that rewards will follow.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, harmony is satisfying; but that’s not all. A sturdy system of thought might equip us better for integrated, creative thinking. When I understand how things connect, my own control over them can improve. For example, insight about human psychology will open up new ways to think about morality, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>But ultimately, Kant found harmony important because it supports the construction of a coherent “worldview.” The English language gained that term through the translation of a German word, “Weltanschauung,” <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/jtph-2022-0007/html\">which Kant coined</a> and which has been a focus of my <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/60631\">own work</a>. At its most basic, a harmonious worldview allows us to feel more at home in the world: We gain a sense of how it hangs together, and see it as imbued with meaning.</p>\n\n<p>How we think ultimately determines how we live. If we have a stable abode of thought, we take that stability into everything we do and have some shelter from life’s storms.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263597/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alexander T.

This experience opened him to altered mental states and introduced him to new ideas from the Viennese psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud about the <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/surrealism/surrealism-and-dreams\">structure of the human mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In states of psychosis, but also in daily occurrences such as dreams and slips of the tongue, Freud saw glimpses of an uncharted region of the psyche, the unconscious. Why, Breton asked, shouldn’t life, and art, take these aspects of human experience into account? Shouldn’t the portion of existence spent dreaming also be recognized as having value? </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Orange paper with text printed in French and titled 'Manifeste du Surréalisme'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The publication of André Breton’s ‘Manifesto of Surrealism’ in 1924 is considered the birth of the surrealist movement.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cover-of-andre-bretons-work-quest-ce-que-le-surrealisme-news-photo/152246727\">Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/manifesto-surrealism-andre-breton\">manifesto published in 1924</a>, Breton called for “the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, if one may so speak.”</p>\n\n<h2>Politics of revolution</h2>\n\n<p>Freud had coined the term “dreamwork” to describe the activity that transformed residues of the day’s memories into vehicles for the expression of our unconscious desires. </p>\n\n<p>For the surrealists, too, dreaming was no simple realm of idle fantasy. They understood the synthesis of sleeping and waking life as promising a liberation no less sweeping than that of the <a href=\"https://www.jacobin.com/2023/07/travellers-of-the-world-revolution-excerpt-comintern-history-politics-soviet-union-communist-party\">revolutionary workers’ movement</a> of their time.</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming the contradiction between dream and reality, they believed, would complement the class struggle between the global proletariat and its bourgeois oppressors. Surrealism was much more than a merely artistic project – it was also a means toward a larger political end. </p>\n\n<p>From a century’s distance, these may appear grandiose, even delusional claims. But 1924, the year of surrealism’s founding, was only seven years after the Russian Revolution. The surrealists wagered on the power of both the revolution of modern art and poetry and the political transformation of society. </p>\n\n<p>“‘Transform the world,’ Marx said; ‘change life,’ [French poet Arthur] Rimbaud said. <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/2/2f/Breton_Andre_Manifestoes_of_Surrealism.pdf\">These two watchwords are one for us</a>,” Breton said, speaking to a group of writers in Paris. In other words, the uncompromising project of remaking social existence would not be complete without the artistic reimagining of the human psyche, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>But by 1935, when Breton pronounced this succinct formulation, the surrealists’ gamble on revolution had already effectively been lost. With <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/great-purge\">Joseph Stalin’s purges</a> underway in Moscow and <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nazi-rise-to-power\">Adolf Hitler consolidating power in Germany</a>, the window for radical change that had seemed to open in the years after World War I was definitively closing. </p>\n\n<p>Soon, the surrealists would find themselves dispersed into exile by a new global conflict. All that remained was for the museums and libraries to collect the relics of that heady ideal and to preserve the artworks and ephemera that registered surrealism’s brief quest to unleash the forces of the unconscious in the name of a new, freer world.</p>\n\n<h2>Surrealism’s unfinished business</h2>\n\n<p>The surrealists aimed to seduce their audiences. That seduction was not undertaken to sell their paintings, or even to provide their audiences a moment’s respite from harried lives. It was done in the name of subversion. They wished – through artworks, films and books – to shatter people’s complacency and move them to change their lives, and the world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Woman in foreground, blurred, shown passing a colorful painting of tree with human face\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A visitor to the Paris exhibition walks past René Magritte’s surrealist ‘Alice in Wonderland,’ painted in 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/FranceSurrealismExhibition/c8f59616f2c54432ab9220896f4c95d6/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Christophe Ena</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The artwork wasn’t a mere window through which to look onto a distant “dreamworld.” It was more like a revolving door one was invited to walk through.

These include translator and author Mark Polizzotti’s 2024 book “<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300257090/why-surrealism-matters/\">Why Surrealism Matters</a>” and art historian Abigail Susik’s 2021 volume “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv29mvt55\">Surrealist Sabotage</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>The centenary of surrealism is a reminder of the movement’s unfinished business of revolutionary seduction. After all, as Breton reminded his readers at the close of his 1924 manifesto, life is not bound to the realities of the world as currently given. </p>\n\n<p>“Existence,” he insisted, “<a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andre-breton-manifesto-of-surrealism\">is elsewhere</a>.”</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264961/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tom McDonough does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Those workers had to stop their work of monitoring and inspecting industrial sites for pollution, and stopped enforcing environmental-protection laws, including the Clean Air Act.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I analyzed six years’ worth of air quality levels, emissions measurements, power production data and weather reports for more than 200 coal-fired power plants around the country. We found that the coal plants’ operators appeared to take advantage of the lapse in enforcement of environmental regulations. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/733758\">started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution</a>. And as soon as the government reopened and inspections resumed, pollution levels dropped.</p>\n\n<h2>Particulate matter is dangerous</h2>\n\n<p>The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history up until that time <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41759\">began on Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted until Jan. 25, 2019</a>. During that period, about 95% of EPA employees were furloughed, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/climate/epa-pollution-inspection-shutdown.html\">nearly all the agency’s pollution inspectors</a>, who keep track of whether industrial sites like coal-fired power plants follow rules meant to limit air pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Among those rules are strict limits on a type of pollution called <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health\">particulate matter</a>, which is sometimes called PM2.5 and PM10. These microscopic particles are smaller than the width of a human hair. When inhaled, they can <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics\">travel deep into the lungs</a> and even get into the bloodstream.

We looked at satellite data from NASA that provides a reliable indicator of <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/atmosphere/aerosol-optical-depth-thickness\">particulate pollution in the atmosphere</a>. We also looked at the amounts of several types of chemicals recorded directly from smokestacks and sent to the EPA.</p>\n\n<p>We looked at each plant’s daily emissions before, during and after the 2018-2019 shutdown, and compared them with the plants’ emissions on the same calendar days in the five previous years, when EPA inspectors were not furloughed.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"3Edmv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3Edmv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Pollution rose and fell with the shutdown</h2>\n\n<p>We found that as soon as the EPA furlough began in 2018, <a href=\"https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/MOD04_3K\">particulate emissions</a> within 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) around the coal-fired power plants rose, according to the NASA data.</p>\n\n<p>The data indicated that, on average, particulate matter during the 2018 and 2019 shutdown was 15% to 20% higher than it had been during the same period in the preceding five years.</p>\n\n<p>And once the EPA inspectors returned to work, the plants’ average particulate pollution dropped back to its pre-shutdown level.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that two other common air pollutants from coal-fired power plants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, did not increase during the furlough period. Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-continuous-emission-monitoring-systems\">continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks</a>, even when the federal government is not operating. Particulate emissions, however, are not continuously monitored: Enforcement of those emissions standards relies on the manual collection of samples from monitors and on-site inspections, both of which halted during the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern was clear: When the EPA stopped watching, coal plants increased pollution. And once inspections resumed, emissions dropped back to normal.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"HvtsS\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HvtsS/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Considering various explanations</h2>\n\n<p>To confirm that the increase in particulate pollution during the shutdown was due to the lack of inspections and not because of some other factors such as weather fluctuations, we tested a range of alternative explanations and found that they did not fit the data we had collected. </p>\n\n<p>For example, weather records showed that <a href=\"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html\">wind</a>, <a href=\"http://prism.oregonstate.edu\">humidity and temperature</a> at and around the coal plants during the shutdown were all within the same ranges as they had been over the previous five years. So the increased particulate pollution during the shutdown was not due to different weather conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Electricity demand – <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/\">how much power the plants were generating</a> – was also typical, and did not increase significantly during the shutdown. That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis also revealed that the coal plants didn’t shift which particular boilers were operating to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=107&amp;t=3\">less efficient ones</a> that would have produced more particulates. So the increase in pollution during the shutdown wasn’t due to just using different equipment to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p>The emissions data we collected also included <a href=\"https://campd.epa.gov/\">carbon dioxide emissions</a>, which gave us insight into what the coal plants were burning. With similar weather conditions and amounts of electricity generated, different types of coal emit different amounts of carbon dioxide. So if we had found carbon dioxide emissions changed, it could have signaled that the plants had changed to burning another type of coal, which could emit more particulate matter – but we did not. This showed us that the increase in particulate emissions was not from changing the specific types of coal being burned to generate electricity. </p>\n\n<p>All of these tests helped us determine that the spike in particulate matter pollution was unique to the 2018–2019 EPA furlough.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"dMaGR\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dMaGR/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Spewing particulate matter</h2>\n\n<p>All of this analysis led us to one final question: Was it, in fact, possible for coal-fired power plants to quickly increase – and then decrease – the amount of particulate matter they emit? The answer is yes. Emissions-control technology does indeed allow that to happen. </p>\n\n<p>Power plants control their particulate emissions with a device called an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-monitoring-knowledge-base/monitoring-control-technique-electrostatic-precipitators\">electrostatic precipitator</a>, which uses static electricity to collect particles from smoke and exhaust before it exits the smokestack. Those devices use electricity to run, which costs money, even for a power plant. Turning them off when the plants are being monitored <a href=\"https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/enforcement/sinclair-clean-air-act-settlement_.html\">risks incurring heavy fines</a>. But when oversight disappeared, the power plants could save money by turning those devices off or reducing their operation, with less risk of being caught and fined.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings indicate that air pollution regulations are only as effective as their enforcement, which had already been decreasing before the 2018 shutdown. Between 2007 and 2018, EPA’s enforcement staff declined by more than 20%, and the number of <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf\">inspections dropped by one-third</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new administration took office in January 2025, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-administration-is-on-track-to-cut-1-in-3-epa-staffers-by-the-end-of-2025-slashing-agencys-ability-to-keep-pollution-out-of-air-and-water-265249\">EPA staffing has been reduced significantly</a>. We found that without strong and continuous monitoring and enforcement, environmental laws risk becoming hollow promises.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267696/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, only about 1 in 4 youths <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.09.041\">maintain positive health behavior patterns</a> during the transition to adulthood. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\">More Americans die of heart disease</a> than of any other condition. People often think of heart disease as an illness that mostly affects older people, but data from electronic health records show that the rate of heart disease in people under 40 has more than <a href=\"https://epicresearch.org/articles/cardiovascular-disease-rates-in-young-adults-have-more-than-doubled-since-2010\">doubled since 2010 and tripled among people who use tobacco</a>. Researchers like me are learning a great deal more about how heart health later in life heavily depends on the habits built during late adolescence and early adulthood. </p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/nursing/faculty-staff/scottj.php\">primary care nurse practitioner</a> and researcher studying <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iE5bQx0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">how early life shapes long-term heart health</a>. In my clinical practice, I frequently care for people in their early 20s who are entering adulthood and are already facing serious cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar or <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bmi-alone-will-no-longer-be-treated-as-the-go-to-measure-for-weight-management-an-obesity-medicine-physician-explains-the-seismic-shift-taking-place-208174*\">a body mass index</a> in the obesity range. </p>\n\n<p>Just as young people on the cusp of adulthood make important decisions about their education, career and relationships, the health habits they build during this critical time also lay the foundation for lifelong heart health <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.105772\">and better quality of life</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Early roots of heart disease</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100371\">most common form of heart disease</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis\">atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</a>, which develops when sticky, fatty plaque builds up in the blood vessels and makes it harder for blood to flow. </p>\n\n<p>Heart health doesn’t suddenly decline in middle age. It starts to slip much earlier, often without people realizing it. In fact, research shows that a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab149\">key turning point is around age 17</a>. That’s when overall heart health scores based on behaviors such as diet, movement and sleep, along with clinical measures such as blood pressure, begin to worsen.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WuXQEZBMmGU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Age 17 is a key turning point when heart health scores can begin to decline in young people.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>That means by the time many young people are finishing high school, heart disease risk factors are already emerging. The good news is that most of the risk factors that drive this buildup are modifiable – meaning you can do something about them. </p>\n\n<p>In a report I co-authored in March 2025, my colleagues and I explored the key risk factors for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.124.039239\">heart disease in emerging adults</a>. One of the most important is nicotine exposure. Use of cigarettes, vapes and other nicotine products has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19022\">surged among young adults in recent years</a>, from 21% of 18- to 23-year-olds in 2002 to 43% in 2018. Nicotine <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.01.003\">damages blood vessels and speeds up the plaque formation</a> process, increasing the risk of serious heart problems later in life. While signs such as chest discomfort or shortness of breath tend to show up much later, the groundwork for those symptoms is laid much earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Obesity is another early risk factor. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data-and-statistics/adult-obesity-prevalence-maps.html\">1 in 5 young people under age 25 have a BMI of 30</a> or higher, and projections suggest <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1703860\">nearly 3 in 5 will meet that threshold by age 35</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.14517\">fewer than half of adults ages 18-34</a> recognize high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure and lack of physical activity as heart disease risk factors. These early warning signs, often uncovered during routine checkups, can set the stage for future heart disease.  </p>\n\n<h2>Societal factors shape heart health, too</h2>\n\n<p>Heart health isn’t shaped by individual choices alone. Broader policies and systems also play a major role. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Affordable Care Act <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/young-adult-and-aca\">allows young adults to stay</a> on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26, which can help ensure access to preventive services. These services, such as routine checkups, blood pressure screenings and conversations about family history, are key opportunities for your primary care provider to catch early signs of cardiovascular risk. </p>\n\n<p>While preventive care use among young adults increased after the ACA was passed, overall <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.12.004\">rates of preventive care visits still remain low</a>. Policies that expand access to health care and that make it easy for young people to take advantage of these services, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968221146806\">such as telehealth</a>, can make a real difference. And if a provider doesn’t bring up heart health during a well-check visit, <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/doctor-appointments-questions-to-ask-your-doctor\">patients can ask questions or start the conversation</a> themselves.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An instructor leads an outdoor exercise class.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Living in a neighborhood with access to outdoor spaces can make it easier to engage in activities that support heart health.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/african-american-man-leading-exercise-class-royalty-free-image/1092427244\">kali9/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond health care access, the conditions of people’s daily lives, such as where they live, their education level and their economic stability, also play important roles in heart health. Neighborhoods can include <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.036035\">resources such as parks and green spaces</a>, which make healthy choices more feasible. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216611\">Education and stable employment</a> are tied to health care access, lower stress and food security, all of which support a healthier heart.</p>\n\n<p>Healthy social connections matter, too. Strong, supportive relationships are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hpb20200622.253235\">linked to better overall well-being</a>, including heart health. Recently, several major health organizations have spotlighted <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">loneliness as a public health issue</a>. However, there is still a lot to learn about exactly how <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/curing-americas-loneliness-epidemic-would-make-us-healthier-fitter-and-less-likely-to-abuse-drugs-206059\">social connections translate to healthier lives</a>, and not enough of this research focuses on young adults. </p>\n\n<p>Pew research shows that 1 in 3 teens report <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/\">near-constant use of social media</a>, but those connections do not yield the same health benefits as interacting in real life. In my own research, I am investigating how social connection affects heart health in young adults in particular.</p>\n\n<h2>Building a foundation for heart health</h2>\n\n<p>There is a lot you can do today to make a difference in your heart health. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.124.039239\">In our recent report</a>, written with the American Heart Association, my colleagues and I highlighted a group of eight risk factors that people can modify to reduce their heart disease risk, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001078\">called the Essential 8</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Dpl4MS1EKw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Embracing the Essential 8, a set of evidence-based measures developed by the American Heart Association, can help young people establish lifelong habits for a healthy heart.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8\">Four are health behaviors</a>. In addition to avoiding nicotine, young people should prioritize getting 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a week, or around 20 minutes a day, as <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults\">recommended by the American Heart Association</a>. They should also aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep nightly and to eat a diet rich in fish, berries and vegetables. Even small changes in these four behaviors can have positive effects.</p>\n\n<p>Of these four behaviors, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.122.060911\">U.S. children score worst on diet</a> – an important area for improvement in the transition to adulthood. Young adults with stronger cooking skills tend to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2018.01.021\">healthier eating habits in middle age</a>, suggesting that learning how to cook could be a valuable step toward better heart health.   </p>\n\n<p>The other <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8\">four factors are clinical measures</a>: blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI. Since the early 2000s, three of the four – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100452\">blood pressure, blood sugar and BMI – have all worsened</a> among young adults. </p>\n\n<p>These changes can go unnoticed until much later, but checking in on them early creates an opportunity to take action. The next time you are at a checkup, ask your provider about your heart health – even if you think you’re too young to be worrying about heart disease. A simple conversation today could shape the way you feel years from now, and your future heart will thank you.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254276/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jewel Scott receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Others, including former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and former Reagan administration Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, have been <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/5-people-who-lied-congress-what-happened-them-n941936\">prosecuted for the same type of crimes</a> – allegedly making false statements to Congress or unlawfully seeking to influence or obstruct a Senate investigation.</p>\n\n<h2>Vindictive prosecution</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.59.4.pdf\">Due to Trump’s repeated</a> statements and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-vindictive-prosecution.html\">social media posts that Comey should be charged</a>, proving a vindictive prosecution may be easier. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the motion to dismiss starts by laying out the argument for a vindictive prosecution, signaling that Comey’s lawyers think this is the stronger argument by leading with it. </p>\n\n<p>Still, if Comey’s lawyers are to convince the judge, they will have to overcome a heavy burden that the prosecution has exceeded the broad discretion of the prosecutor. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=lawreview\">legal standard requires</a> a court to first find that the prosecutor had animus, hostility, toward Comey, and second, that the charges would not have been brought if there was no animus. </p>\n\n<p>The motion to dismiss based on vindictive prosecution makes a very strong showing of animus, relying on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-vindictive-prosecution.html\">Trump’s several statements and social media posts</a> that Comey should be prosecuted and that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">Comey was a “Dirty Cop” and “a total SLIMEBALL!</a>” </p>\n\n<p>Further evidence involves the fact that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/22/trump-comey-prosecutor-appointments/\">no other prosecutor</a> other than Trump’s former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, would seek charges against Comey. </p>\n\n<p>Still, the grand jury found probable cause for the two charges against Comey and issued the indictment.

They provide independent living assistance, disaster relief and emergency shelter, among other services.</p>\n\n<p>Our team found that 21% lost a grant or contract, 27% faced delays or funding freezes and 6% were hit with stop-work orders. Some of the nonprofits had experienced more than one of these funding problems, which affected nonprofits of all kinds. But they were especially disruptive to larger ones that employ more people and provide key services, such as large social service agencies, food banks and organizations serving people <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-medicaid-and-americas-long-struggle-to-establish-a-health-care-safety-net-251776\">enrolled in Medicaid</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"pEulW\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pEulW/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These findings came from the most recent <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/nptrends\">Nonprofit Trends and Impacts</a> survey, which we conducted from April to June 2025 with colleagues at the Urban Institute, including <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/laura-tomasko\">Laura Tomasko</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/hannah-martin\">Hannah Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/katie-fallon\">Katie Fallon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/elizabeth-t-boris\">Elizabeth T. Boris</a>. They follow findings from a prior survey that the project fielded between October 2024 and January 2025.</p>\n\n<p>When funding dries up, nonprofits tend to shrink and scale back their services. About 21% of those hit by funding cuts in the first half of 2025 were already serving fewer people by the time they <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-government-funding-disruptions-affected-nonprofits-early-2025\">completed the survey in April, May and June 2025</a>, and 29% had reduced their staff. Many of these nonprofit leaders also told us they expect to have to lay off more of their employees by the end of 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits had already been facing financial pressure.</p>\n\n<p>In the prior round of the survey that our team conducted in the fall of 2024, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/nonprofit-leaders-top-concerns-entering-2025\">more than half of nonprofit leaders said they were worried</a> about their organization’s finances. Many of them said they had received less money through donations and were facing tougher competition when they applied for grants, largely due to a tougher economic climate and the end of federal funding that had been disbursed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Nonprofits often partner with the government to deliver essential services. This <a href=\"https://independentsector.org/resource/health-of-the-u-s-nonprofit-sector/\">government support is vital</a> – it makes up about 20% of the revenue that most nonprofits rely on. What’s more, government funding provided <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/government-grants-and-contracts-nonprofits-2023\">more than half of total revenue for about 1 in 5</a> service-oriented nonprofits in 2023, which is the most recent data available.</p>\n\n<p>That same year, about 2 in 3 nonprofits received <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/government-grants-and-contracts-nonprofits-2023\">at least one federal, state or local government grant or contract</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Government funding made up <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-government-funding-disruptions-affected-nonprofits-early-2025\">42% of total revenue</a> for service-providing nonprofits that experienced government funding disruptions in our 2025 survey. The rest of their funding came from donations, foundation grants and service fees.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits get less than half of their <a href=\"https://independentsector.org/resource/health-of-the-u-s-nonprofit-sector/\">total revenue from foundations and individual donations</a>, and total government funding for nonprofits <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-financial-risk-nonprofits-losing-government-grants\">amounts to around three times total foundation funding</a>. That makes it unlikely that philanthropy will replace the government funding that’s being lost.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>Nonprofits from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-funding-cuts-nonprofits-funding-freeze-social-safety-net-welfare-ed2e5b30445c9ffdb07346e42c0abfa3\">California</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2025/10/07/local-nonprofits-government-shutdown-impact.html\">Florida</a> are seeing their funding withheld, and the government shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, is compounding the effects of the Trump administration’s longer-term spending cuts. The full extent of the impacts of these federal disruptions on nonprofits’ budgets won’t be known until 2026 or later.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/Methodology_of_the_National_Surveys_of_Nonprofit_Trends_and_Impacts_2024_and_2025.pdf\">our survey doesn’t include</a> the leaders of very small nonprofits, or several kinds of nonprofits – including hospitals, colleges, universities, churches and foundations.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Our upcoming Nonprofit Trends and Impacts surveys in early 2026 will convey more of the effects of government funding cuts on nonprofits’ budgets and programs.</p>\n\n<p>A more complete picture will not be possible until the Internal Revenue Service publishes data that it <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019\">collects from the 990 form</a> that most charitable nonprofits must file on an annual basis. Historically, The IRS has <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/data-nonprofits-government-funding-have-four-main-limitations-national-survey-nonprofit\">taken years to release</a> comprehensive nonprofit financial data, requiring additional research beyond the 990 form.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267795/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lewis Faulk is a Non-Resident Fellow of the Urban Institute.

In contrast, human eyes perform these same functions using soft, flexible tissues in a highly compact form.</p>\n\n<p>Our lens, called the photo-responsive hydrogel soft lens, or PHySL, replaces rigid components with soft polymers acting as artificial muscles. The polymers are composed of a <a href=\"https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-what-is-a-hydrogel\">hydrogel</a> − a water-based polymer material. This hydrogel muscle changes the shape of a soft lens to alter the lens’s focal length, a mechanism analogous to the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470669/figure/myopia.F7/\">ciliary muscles</a> in the human eye.</p>\n\n<p>The hydrogel material contracts in response to light, allowing us to control the lens without touching it by projecting light onto its surface. This property also allows us to finely control the shape of the lens by selectively illuminating different parts of the hydrogel. By eliminating rigid optics and structures, our system is flexible and compliant, making it more durable and safer in contact with the body.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Artificial vision using cameras is commonplace in a variety of technological systems, including robots and medical tools. The optics needed to form a visual system are still typically restricted to rigid materials using electric power. This limitation presents a challenge for emerging fields, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.99907-0\">soft robotics</a> and biomedical tools that integrate soft materials into flexible, low-power and autonomous systems. Our soft lens is particularly suitable for this task.</p>\n\n<p>Soft robots are machines made with compliant materials and structures, taking inspiration from animals. This additional flexibility makes them more durable and adaptive.

This is the surprising takeaway of a new study that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09655-y\">we and our colleagues published in the journal Nature</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While developing mRNA vaccines for patients with brain tumors in 2016, our team, led by <a href=\"https://directory.ufhealth.org/sayour-elias\">pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour</a>, discovered that mRNA can train immune systems to kill tumors – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01380-1\">even if the mRNA is not related to cancer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mRNA vaccines designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 might also have antitumor effects. </p>\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqVdPM4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">we looked at clinical outcomes</a> for more than 1,000 late-stage melanoma and lung cancer patients treated with a type of immunotherapy called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006\">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>. This treatment is a common approach doctors use to train the immune system to kill cancer. It does this by blocking a protein that tumor cells make to turn off immune cells, enabling the immune system to continue killing cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkably, patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy were more than twice as likely to be alive after three years compared with those who didn’t receive either vaccine. Surprisingly, patients with tumors that don’t typically respond well to immunotherapy also saw very strong benefits, with nearly fivefold improvement in three-year overall survival. This link between improved survival and receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine remained strong even after we controlled for factors like disease severity and co-occurring conditions.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the underlying mechanism, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2q2tK8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">we turned to animal models</a>. We found that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines act like an alarm, triggering the body’s immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells and overcome the cancer’s ability to turn off immune cells. When combined, vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors coordinate to unleash the full power of the immune system to kill cancer cells.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D_Iz9s9Y6k?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">University of Florida Health pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, who led the research, explains that mRNA vaccines that are not specific to a patient’s cancer can ‘wake up the sleeping giant that is the immune system to fight cancer.’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006\">revolutionized cancer treatment</a> over the past decade by producing cures in many patients who were previously considered incurable. However, these therapies are ineffective in patients with <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cold-tumor\">“cold” tumors</a> that successfully evade immune detection.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that mRNA vaccines may provide just the spark the immune system needs to turn these “cold” tumors “hot.” If validated in our upcoming clinical trial, our hope is that this widely available, low-cost intervention could extend the benefits of immunotherapy to millions of patients who otherwise would not benefit from this therapy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Countless clear vials of liquid with labels reading 'CANCER mRNA vaccine 10 ML' on a table\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Combining immunotherapy with mRNA vaccines could allow more patients to benefit from this treatment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/mrna-cancer-vaccines-conceptual-illustration-royalty-free-illustration/2167929866?phrase=cancer%20mrna%20vaccines&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Thom Leach/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What other research is being done</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike vaccines for infectious diseases, which are used to prevent an infection, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003\">therapeutic cancer vaccines</a> are used to help train the immune systems of cancer patients to better fight tumors. </p>\n\n<p>We and many others are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003\">currently working hard</a> to make <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/customizing-mrna-is-easy-and-thats-what-makes-it-the-next-frontier-for-personalized-medicine-a-molecular-biologist-explains-216127\">personalized mRNA vaccines</a> for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/brain-cancer-in-children-is-notoriously-hard-to-treat-a-new-mrna-cancer-vaccine-triggers-an-attack-from-within-228666\">patients with cancer</a>. This involves taking a small sample of a patient’s tumor and using machine learning algorithms to predict which proteins in the tumor would be the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-01270-x\">best targets for a vaccine</a>. However, this approach can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01674-3\">costly and difficult to manufacture</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not need to be personalized, are already widely available at low or no cost around the globe, and could be administered at any time during a patient’s treatment. Our findings that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09655-y\">COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have substantial antitumor effects</a> bring hope that they could help extend the anti-cancer benefits of mRNA vaccines to all.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>In pursuit of this goal, we are preparing to test this treatment strategy in patients with a nationwide clinical trial in people with lung cancer. People receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor will be randomized to either receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during treatment or not.</p>\n\n<p>This study will tell us whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should be included as part of the standard of care for patients receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Ultimately, we hope that this approach will help many patients who are treated with immune therapy, and especially those who currently lack effective treatment options.</p>\n\n<p>This work exemplifies how a tool born from a global pandemic may provide a new weapon against cancer and rapidly extend the benefits of existing treatments to millions of patients. By harnessing a familiar vaccine in a new way, we hope to extend the lifesaving benefits of immunotherapy to cancer patients who were previously left behind.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258992/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adam Grippin receives funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Brain Tumor Association, and the Radiological Society of North America.

According to our new research, how someone views billionaires isn’t just about economics. Judgment also hinges on certain cultural and moral instincts, which helps explain why opinions about wealth are so polarized.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf158\">The study</a>, which my colleague <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xvOcrtUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Mohammad Atari</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9WB4v4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and I</a> published in the research journal PNAS Nexus in June 2025, examined survey data from more than 4,300 people across 20 countries. We found that while most people around the world do not strongly condemn having “too much money,” there are striking cultural differences.</p>\n\n<p>In wealthy, more economically equal countries such as Switzerland and Belgium, people were more likely to say that having too much money is immoral. In countries that are poorer and more unequal, such as Peru or Nigeria, people tended to view wealth accumulation as more acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond economics, we found that judgments about excessive wealth are also shaped by deeper moral intuitions. Our study drew on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000470\">moral foundations theory</a>, which proposes that people’s sense of right and wrong is built on six core values – care, equality, proportionality, loyalty, authority and purity. We found that people who highly value equality and purity were more likely to see excessive wealth as wrong. </p>\n\n<p>The equality result was expected, but the role of purity was more surprising. Purity is usually associated with ideas about cleanliness, sanctity or avoiding contamination – so finding that it is associated with negative views about wealth gives new meaning to the phrase “filthy rich.” </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.jacksonptrager.com/\">a social psychologist</a> who studies morality, culture and technology, I’m interested in how these kinds of judgments differ across groups and societies. Social and institutional systems interact with individual moral beliefs, shaping how people view culture war issues such as wealth and inequality − and, in turn, how they engage with the policies and conflicts that emerge around them.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Billionaires wield growing influence in politics, technology and global development. The richest 1% of people on Earth <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-top-1-own-more-wealth-95-humanity-shadow-global-oligarchy-hangs-over-un\">own more wealth than 95% of people combined</a>, according to Oxfam, an organization focused on fighting poverty. </p>\n\n<p>Efforts to address inequality by taxing or regulating the rich may, however, rest on a mistaken assumption — that the public generally condemns extreme wealth. If most people instead view amassing wealth as morally justifiable, such reforms could face limited support.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that in countries where inequality is highly visible and persistent, people may adapt by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1994.tb01008.x\">morally justifying their structural economic system</a>, arguing that it is fair and legitimate. In wealthier, more equal societies, people appear more sensitive to the potential harms of excess.</p>\n\n<p>While our study shows that most people around the world do not view excessive wealth as morally wrong, those in wealthier and more equal countries are far more likely to condemn it. </p>\n\n<p>That contrast raises a sharper question: When people in privileged societies denounce and attempt to limit billionaires, are they shining a light on global injustice − or projecting their own sense of guilt? Are they projecting a moral principle shaped by their own prosperity onto poorer countries, where wealth may represent survival, progress or even hope? </p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>One open question: How do these views change over time? Do attitudes shift when societies become wealthier or more equal? Are young people more likely than older generations to condemn billionaires? Our study offers a snapshot, but long-term research could reveal whether moral judgments track broader economic or cultural changes.</p>\n\n<p>Another uncertainty is the unexpected role of purity. Why would a value tied to cleanliness and sanctity shape how people judge billionaires? <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf158\">Our follow-up study</a> found that purity concerns extended beyond money to other forms of “excess,” such as disapproving of having “too much” ambition, sex or fun. This suggests that people may see excess itself – not just inequality – as corrupting.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>We’re continuing to study how cultural values, social systems and moral intuitions shape people’s judgments of fairness and excess – from views of wealth and ambition to knowledge and AI computing power.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these gut-level, moral reactions within larger social systems matters for debates about inequality. But it can also help explain how people evaluate technologies, leaders and institutions that accumulate disproportionate, excessive power or influence.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265247/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jackson Trager does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This doesn’t exist yet, but space commerce is a growing industry. The <a href=\"https://www.spacefoundation.org/2025/07/22/the-space-report-2025-q2/\">Space Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization for education and advocacy of space, estimates that the global space economy rose to US$613 billion in 2024, up nearly 8% from 2023, and 250 times larger than <a href=\"https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=112996\">all business at farmer’s markets in the United States</a>. This number includes launch vehicles, satellite hardware, and services provided by these space-based assets, such as satellite phone or internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>Companies involved in spaceflight have been around since the start of the Space Age. By the 1980s, corporate space activity was gaining traction. President Ronald Reagan saw the need for a federal agency to oversee and guide this industry and <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/law/office-of-space-commerce/\">created the Office of Space Commerce</a>, or OSC.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The logo of the OSC, which is circular and has three stars and nine black and white stripes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Office of Space Commerce is under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/OSC-logo-2025-1721x1721-1.png\">Office of Space Commerce − National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So, what exactly does this office do and why is it important?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B1GhRV4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">As a space scientist</a>, I am interested in how the U.S. regulates commercial activities in space. In addition, I teach a course on space policy. In class, we talk about the OSC and its role in the wider regulatory landscape affecting commercial use of outer space. </p>\n\n<h2>The OSC’s focus areas</h2>\n\n<p>The Office of Space Commerce, an office of <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/about/organization-and-staffing/\">about 50 people</a>, exists within the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To paraphrase its <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/about/\">mission statement</a>, its chief purpose is to enable a robust U.S. commercial interest in outer space. </p>\n\n<p>OSC has three main focus areas. First, it is the office responsible for licensing and monitoring how private U.S. companies collect and distribute orbit-based images of Earth. There are many companies launching satellites with special cameras to look back down at the Earth these days. Companies offer a variety of data products and services from such imagery – for instance, to <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/feature-articles/commercial-satellites-shed-light-small-scale-agriculture\">improve agricultural land use</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A second primary job of OSC is space advocacy. OSC works with the other U.S. government agencies that also have jurisdiction over commercial use of outer space to make the regulatory environment easier. This includes working with the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/space/licenses\">Federal Aviation Administration</a> on launch licensing, the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/policy-and-rules-division/general/radio-spectrum-allocation\">Federal Communications Commission</a> on radio wavelength usage and the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-and-guidance-information-topic-waste\">Environmental Protection Agency</a> on rules about the hazardous chemicals in rocket fuel.</p>\n\n<p>This job also includes coordinating with other countries that allow companies to launch satellites, collect data in orbit and offer space-based services. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, for example, the OSC helped revise the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, one of the main documents restricting the shipping of advanced technologies out of the country. <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/23/2024-23932/export-administration-regulations-removal-of-license-requirements-for-certain-spacecraft-and-related\">This change</a> removed some limitations, allowing American companies to export certain types of spacecraft to three countries: Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>The OSC also coordinates commercial satellites’ flight paths in near-Earth space, which is its third and largest function. The Department of Defense <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/18th-space-control-squadron/\">keeps track</a> of thousands of objects in outer space and issues alerts when the probability of a collision gets high. In 2018, President Donald Trump issued <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-national-space-council-signing-space-policy-directive-3/\">Space Policy Directive-3</a>, which included tasking OSC to take this role over for nongovernment satellites – that is, those owned by companies, not NASA or the military. The Department od Defense wants out of the job of traffic management involving privately owned satellites, and Trump’s directive in 2018 started the process of handing off this task to OSC.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A rocket launching from a structure, with a plume of smoke beneath it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When companies launch satellites into orbit, as on this SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the OSC helps manage the satellites’ flight paths in orbit to avoid collisions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=spacex%20starlink&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/John Raoux</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To prevent satellites from colliding, OSC has been developing the <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/traffic-coordination-system-for-space-tracss/\">traffic coordination system for space</a>, known as TraCSS. It went into beta testing in 2024 and has some of the companies with the largest commercial constellations – such as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html\">SpaceX’s Starlink</a> – participating. Progress on this has been slower than anticipated, though, and <a href=\"https://www.oversight.gov/reports/audit/noaas-office-space-commerce-efforts-provide-space-situational-awareness-services-have\">an audit in 2024</a> revealed that the plan is way behind schedule and perhaps still years away.</p>\n\n<h2>Elevating OSC</h2>\n\n<p>Deep in the text of Trump’s Aug. 13, 2025, executive order called <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\">Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry</a>, there’s a directive to elevate OSC to report directly to the office of the secretary of commerce. This would make OSC equivalent to its current overseer, NOAA, with respect to importance and priority within the Department of Commerce. It would give OSC higher stature in setting more of the rules regarding commercial use of space, and it would make space commerce more visible across the broader economy.</p>\n\n<p>So, why did Trump include this line about elevating OSC in his Aug. 13 executive order? </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An astronaut pointing a camera out a circular window in the International Space Station at a\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, Expedition 41 flight engineer, uses a still camera at a window in the cupola of the International Space Station as the SpaceX Dragon commercial cargo craft approaches the station on Sept. 23, 2014.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details/iss041e020816\">Alex Gerst/Johnson Space Center</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Back in 2018, Trump issued <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/space-policy-directive-2-streamlining-regulations-commercial-use-space/\">Space Policy Directive-2</a> during his first term, which included a task to create the Space Policy Advancing Commerce Enterprise Administration, or SPACE. SPACE would have been an entity reporting directly to the secretary of commerce. While it was proposed as a bill in the House of Representatives later that year, it never became law. </p>\n\n<p>The Aug. 13 executive order essentially directs the Department of Commerce to make this move now. Should the secretary of commerce enact the order, it would bypass the role of Congress in promoting OSC. The 60-day window that Trump placed in the executive order for making this change has closed, but with the government shutdown it is unclear whether the elevation of OSC might still occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Troubles for OSC</h2>\n\n<p>While all of this sounds good for promoting space as a place for commercial activity, OSC has been under stress in 2025. In February, the Department of Government Efficiency targeted NOAA for cuts, including <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-office-of-space-commerce-doge-cuts/\">firing eight people</a> from OSC. Because about half of the people working in OSC are contractors, this represented a 30% reduction of force. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The dome of the Congress building in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many space industry professionals have urged Congress to restore funding to the OSC, but its future remains uncertain.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=trump%20budget&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/J.

In July, space industry leaders <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5391185-space-industry-companies-congress-funding-space-commerce-office/\">urged Congress</a> to restore funding to OSC. </p>\n\n<p>The Aug. 13 executive order appeared to be good news for OSC. On Sept. 9, however, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Commerce requested <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-05/trump-claws-back-2025-funding-for-commercial-space-office\">a 40% rescission</a> to OSC’s fiscal year 2025 budget. </p>\n\n<p>Rescissions are “clawbacks” of funds already approved and appropriated by Congress. The promised funding is essentially put on hold. Once proposed by the president, rescissions have to be voted on by both chambers of Congress to be enacted. This must occur within 45 days, or before the end of the fiscal year, which was Sept. 30. </p>\n\n<p>This rescission request came so close to that deadline that Congress did not act to stop it. As a result, OSC lost this funding. The loss could mean additional cutbacks to staff and perhaps even a shrinking of its focus areas. </p>\n\n<p>Will OSC be elevated? Will OSC be restructured or even dismantled? The future is still uncertain for this office.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265710/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michael Liemohn receives or has received funding from NASA, NSF, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the European Union.

As the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/buildland.27.1.0017\">historian Ryan K. Smith writes</a>, Shockoe “was not, as some would say, abandoned – it was actively destroyed.” </p>\n\n<h2>African burying grounds found and lost</h2>\n\n<p>This issue of protecting Black cemeteries first came to popular attention in 1991, when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/afbg/index.htm\">African Burial Ground</a> in downtown New York City was rediscovered and nearly obliterated by a construction project. It was preserved only through the valiant efforts of African American leaders and scientists.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, similar threats to Black cemeteries and questions about preservation have been reported at the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-enslaved-grave-sites\">Whitney Plantation</a> in Louisiana, the <a href=\"https://www.friendsofmoseshall.org/\">Morningstar Tabernacle No. 88</a> in Maryland and a <a href=\"https://time.com/5735711/lost-florida-cemetery/\">rediscovered graveyard</a> in Florida, among <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/blog/locating-mapping-black-cemeteries\">many others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like these other cemeteries, the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground has long faced constant perils, from grave robbing to construction projects. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/06/one-womans-crusade-brings-attention-long-forgotten/\">Lenora McQueen</a>, whose ancestor <a href=\"https://www.phillytrib.com/news/wheres-kitty-cary-the-answer-unlocked-black-history-richmond-tried-to-hide/article_4d7e2eae-6c46-5643-a97f-8cd4ea142ba9.html\">Kitty Cary</a> was buried there in 1857, has been leading the effort to protect the cemetery. McQueen’s tireless work – like the efforts needed at any disregarded Black cemetery in the country – has ranged from collaborating with city officials to <a href=\"https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/2021/04/the-city-of-richmond-now-owns-2nd.html\">purchase part of the site</a>, establishing a <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/30/once-a-dead-end-a-richmond-cemetery-earns-new-respect/\">marker</a> and <a href=\"https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2023/jun/22/sacred-burial-site-be-marked-mural/\">mural</a>, and assembling a team to earn the burying ground the <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/2021/08/16/approaching-the-national-register-shockoe-hill/\">recognition of the National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12149/death-and-rebirth-southern-city\">Smith has detailed</a> how, ever since Richmond’s founding in the 1730s, people of European and African descent in the city lived divided lives. By the early 1800s, officials formalized different cemeteries for Richmond’s different ethnic and racial communities. </p>\n\n<p>A 1-acre cemetery for free Black people and another one for enslaved people were situated near the city poorhouse and gunpowder depot. Yet, these grounds were hallowed to the African American community. Burial rituals included long processions, biblical-inflected homilies, spirituals and public displays of grief. </p>\n\n<p>However, the violations of these graves were easy enough. The cemetery was neither fenced nor formally tended. In the 1830s, medical schools began <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/\">robbing the burying ground</a> for cadavers. At the close of the Civil War, retreating Confederates <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/landslide2021/locations/shockoe.html\">exploded the gunpowder magazine</a>, reportedly destroying a section of the cemetery.</p>\n\n<p>City officials formally <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">closed the cemetery</a> in 1879, and the site’s systematic destruction began, despite constant objections of Black residents. Road and construction projects <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/30/once-a-dead-end-a-richmond-cemetery-earns-new-respect/\">cut through the burial grounds</a>. An African American editor at the time <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/\">denounced</a> the “people who profited by the desecration of the burial ground … when graves were dug into, bones scattered, coffins exposed and the hearts of the surviving families made to bleed by the desecration of the remains of their loved ones.”</p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed, a railroad track and an elevated highway were built on portions of the cemetery. In 1960, Richmond city officials <a href=\"https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/2021/04/the-city-of-richmond-now-owns-2nd.html\">sold a portion of the burying ground</a> to Shell, and a gas station was built atop the remains of human beings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The struggle to preserve Shockoe</h2>\n\n<p>In 2011, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources conducted a survey to determine the <a href=\"https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Appendix_R-Attachment_R11_Architectural_Survey_GNSA-SAAM-BBHW_Segment.pdf\">eligibility of the deserted auto shop</a> for the National Register of Historic Places. It did not even consider the history of the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground beneath and around the building as part of the site’s evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>Six years later, McQueen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/27/richmond-shockoe-african-burying-ground/\">learned that her ancestor</a> was interred at the burying ground. Horrified by the cemetery’s state of disarray, she became its leading advocate. Eventually, McQueen put together a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Undoing_Things/7YNTEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=undoing+african+american+remains&amp;pg=PT227&amp;printsec=frontcover\">team of scholars and preservationists</a> to pursue their own study of the site’s eligibility for the national register. They found the cultural landscape – the traces of human activity that give a place its history and meaning – to be highly significant.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the site’s history of destruction was a vital record of the unequal treatment shown toward Black burying grounds in the U.S. The team formally pursued its own nomination to the National Register of Historic places.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/127-7231/\">Shockoe Hill Burying Ground Historic District</a> was successfully listed is on the national register.</p>\n\n<p>Even with this success, the threats continue. Being listed on the national register provides prestige, grant opportunities and reviews for federal projects, but few guaranteed protections. In the same year Shockoe was listed on the national register, <a href=\"https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/9-Digging-and-the-laying-of-utility-lines-3-7-22c.pdf\">utility lines were installed</a> in the area without consulting heritage officials. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landslide-update-shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">high-speed rail project</a>, if implemented as planned, could violate the cemetery’s historical landscape. <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/questions-raised-new-memorial-design-proposals-shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">Designs for a memorial</a>, while well intentioned, might further harm the site and threaten its national register status if it is not treated as a cemetery with graves.</p>\n\n<p>What the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground reveals is the need for the U.S. to provide dignity to all its citizens, in life and in death. A cemetery does not need famous inhabitants or marble tombstones to be significant. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/black-indigenous-archaeology-unmarked-graves/\">McQueen has said</a> of her ancestor’s eternal resting ground, “Burial spaces are sacred.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264864/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have sat in on some meetings about the burial ground&#39;s preservation as a heritage expert, at the request of the descendant Lenora McQueen.</span></em></p>",

As the bot serves up practical suggestions and encouragement, insights come more easily, drafts polish up quickly and feedback loops feel immediate. It can be energizing. But when that AI support is removed, some students <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbah.2025.100181\">report feeling less confident or less willing to engage</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These outcomes raise the question: Can AI tools genuinely boost student motivation? And what conditions can make or break that boost?</p>\n\n<p>As AI tools become more common in classroom settings, the answers to these questions matter a lot. While tools for general use such as ChatPGT or Claude remain popular, more and more students are encountering AI tools that are purpose-built to support learning, such as Khan Academy’s Khanmigo, which personalizes lessons. Others, such as ALEKS, provide adaptive feedback. Both tools adjust to a learner’s level and highlight progress over time, which helps students feel capable and see improvement. But there are still many unknowns about the long-term effects of these tools on learners’ progress, an issue I continue to study as an educational psychologist.</p>\n\n<h2>What the evidence shows so far</h2>\n\n<p>Recent studies indicate that AI can boost motivation, at least for certain groups, when deployed under the right conditions. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-08697-6\">2025 experiment with university students</a> showed that when AI tools delivered a high-quality performance and allowed meaningful interaction, students’ motivation and their confidence in being able to complete a task – known as self-efficacy – increased. </p>\n\n<p>For foreign language learners, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-04878-w\">a 2025 study</a> found that university students using AI-driven personalized systems took more pleasure in learning and had less anxiety and more self-efficacy compared with those using traditional methods. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10755-024-09747-z\">A recent cross-cultural analysis</a> with participants from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Poland who were studying diverse majors suggested that positive motivational effects are strongest when tools prioritize autonomy, self-direction and critical thinking. These individual findings align with a broader, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2025.100455\">systematic review of generative AI tools</a> that found positive effects on student motivation and engagement across cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NYDZ4\">A forthcoming meta-analysis</a> from my team at the University of Alabama, which synthesized 71 studies, echoed these patterns. We found that generative AI tools on average produce moderate positive effects on motivation and engagement. The impact is larger when tools are used consistently over time rather than in one-off trials. Positive effects were also seen when teachers provide scaffolding, when students maintain agency in how they use the tool, and when the output quality is reliable. </p>\n\n<p>But there are caveats. More than 50 of the studies we reviewed did not draw on a clear theoretical framework of motivation, and some used methods that we found were weak or inappropriate. This raises concerns about the quality of the evidence and underscores how much more careful research is needed before one can say with confidence that AI nurtures students’ intrinsic motivation rather than just making tasks easier in the moment.</p>\n\n<h2>When AI backfires</h2>\n\n<p>There is also research that paints a more sobering picture. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-98385-2\">A large study</a> of more than 3,500 participants found that while human–AI collaboration improved task performance, it reduced intrinsic motivation once the AI was removed. Students reported more boredom and less satisfaction, suggesting that overreliance on AI can erode confidence in their own abilities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07356331251329185\">Another study</a> suggested that while learning achievement often rises with the use of AI tools, increases in motivation are smaller, inconsistent or short-lived. Quality matters as much as quantity. When AI delivers inaccurate results, or when students feel they have little control over how it is used, motivation quickly erodes. Confidence drops, engagement fades and students can begin to see the tool as a crutch rather than a support. And because there are not many long-term studies in this field, we still do not know whether AI can truly sustain motivation over time, or whether its benefits fade once the novelty wears off.</p>\n\n<h2>Not all AI tools work the same way</h2>\n\n<p>The impact of AI on student motivation is not one-size-fits-all. Our team’s meta-analysis shows that, on average, AI tools do have a positive effect, but the size of that effect depends on how and where they are used. When students work with AI regularly over time, when teachers guide them in using it thoughtfully, and when students feel in control of the process, the motivational benefits are much stronger. </p>\n\n<p>We also saw differences across settings. College students seemed to gain more than younger learners, STEM and writing courses tended to benefit more than other subjects, and tools designed to give feedback or tutoring support outperformed those that simply generated content. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young student working on tablet at school.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Specialized AI-based tools designed for learning tend to work better for students with proper teacher support compared to general-purpose chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude. But those specialized products typically cost money, raising questions over equity and quality of education.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Education%20classroom%20students&amp;mediaType=photo\">Charlie Riedel/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There is also evidence that general-use tools like ChatGPT or Claude do not reliably promote intrinsic motivation or deeper engagement with content, compared to learning-specific platforms such as ALEKS and Khanmigo, which are more effective at supporting persistence and self-efficacy. However, these tools often come with subscription or licensing costs. This raises questions of equity, since the students who could benefit most from motivational support may also be the least likely to afford it.</p>\n\n<p>These and other recent findings should be seen as only a starting point. Because AI is so new and is changing so quickly, what we know today may not hold true tomorrow. In a paper titled <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20965311251367053\">The Death and Rebirth of Research in Education in the Age of AI</a>, the authors argue that the speed of technological change makes traditional studies outdated before they are even published. At the same time, AI opens the door to new ways of studying learning that are more participatory, flexible and imaginative. Taken together, the data and the critiques point to the same lesson: Context, quality and agency matter just as much as the technology itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters for all of us</h2>\n\n<p>The lessons from this growing body of research are straightforward. The presence of AI does not guarantee higher motivation, but it can make a difference if tools are designed and used with care and understanding of students’ needs. When it is used thoughtfully, in ways that strengthen students’ sense of competence, autonomy and connection to others, it can be a powerful ally in learning. </p>\n\n<p>But without those safeguards, the short-term boost in performance could come at a steep cost. Over time, there is the risk of weakening the very qualities that matter most – motivation, persistence, critical thinking and the uniquely human capacities that no machine can replace.</p>\n\n<p>For teachers, this means that while AI may prove a useful partner in learning, it should never serve as a stand-in for genuine instruction. For parents, it means paying attention to how children use AI at home, noticing whether they are exploring, practicing and building skills or simply leaning on it to finish tasks. For policymakers and technology developers, it means creating systems that support student agency, provide reliable feedback and avoid encouraging overreliance. And for students themselves, it is a reminder that AI can be a tool for growth, but only when <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-does-ai-affect-how-we-learn-a-cognitive-psychologist-explains-why-you-learn-when-the-work-is-hard-262863\">paired with their own effort</a> and curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of technology, students need to feel capable, autonomous and connected. Without these basic psychological needs in place, their sense of motivation will falter – with or without AI.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264728/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Yurou Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Even though comprehensive research since January 2025 is still emerging, early findings already suggest a further narrowing of what feels safe to say.</p>\n\n<p>One-third of faculty reported in January that they feel they have less freedom to express their views, reflecting an environment in which faculty members’ <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/faculty-report-declining-academic-freedom\">voices are increasingly constrained</a> </p>\n\n<p>Faculty I spoke with over the past few months described “navigating sensitive boundaries” in their lectures, avoiding having any discussion about race, gender and religion. They also talked about not using terms like <a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-dei\">diversity, equity and inclusion</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Watching what you say</h2>\n\n<p>For professors on <a href=\"https://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/contingent-contract/\">contingent contracts</a> – meaning they are not on a track to <a href=\"https://academicpositions.com/career-advice/what-is-tenure\">receive tenure</a>, a secure work position that typically lasts a lifetime – the fear is heightened. The same is true for other faculty members like <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/education/adjunct-teaching\">adjunct professors</a>, who depend on short-term or renewable contracts. </p>\n\n<p>Without the protection of tenure, even a single complaint or potential controversy can jeopardize a professor’s position – and recent cases of tenured professors suggest that even tenure no longer offers the same <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/18/tenure-college-faculty-republican-challenges/\">level of security it once did</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One adjunct professor put it bluntly: “When your next contract depends on staying in bounds, watching what you say is survival.” </p>\n\n<p>For many instructors, the need to continually reassess how a comment, reading or assignment might be received changes the experience of teaching in subtle but meaningful ways.</p>\n\n<p>Faculty members I spoke with described heightened anxiety, sleepless nights and a persistent fear that a misstep could derail their careers. This psychological strain, compounded by workload and financial stress, leaves little space for creativity, innovation or joy in teaching.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white photo of an older man wearing a blazer has different-colored squiggle lines coming out from his head, forming a cloudlike shape above him\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many faculty members report that they are increasingly self-censoring in order to avoid potential controversy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/contemporary-art-collage-old-man-in-retro-suit-royalty-free-image/1423584992?phrase=faculty%20mental%20health&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">master1350/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The downstream effects on students</h2>\n\n<p>Faculty members’ well-being is inseparable from how students experience college.

Instead, sloth teeth are made primarily of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2741/E281\">dentin</a>, a more porous and organic-rich tissue that readily changes its chemical composition with fossilization. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/38229\">Stable isotope analyses</a> are less dependable in sloths because dentin’s chemical composition <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.02.021\">can be altered</a> postmortem, skewing the isotopic signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique researchers use to glean information about an animal’s diet relies on analyzing the microscopic wear patterns on its teeth. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/2051-672X/4/2/023002\">Dental microwear texture analysis</a> can infer whether an animal mostly ate tough foods such as leaves and grass or hard foods such as seeds and fruit pits. This technique is also tricky when it comes to sloths’ fossilized teeth because signs of wear may be preserved differently in the softer dentin than in harder enamel.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to studying fossil sloths, we vetted <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1644/12-MAMM-A-204.1\">dental microwear methods in modern xenarthrans</a>, a group of animals that includes sloths, armadillos and anteaters. This study demonstrated that dentin microwear can reveal dietary differences between leaf-eating sloths and insect-consuming armadillos, giving us confidence that these tools could reveal dietary information from ground sloth fossils.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinct dietary niches revealed</h2>\n\n<p>Previous research suggested that giant ground sloths were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.58782/flmnh.tdzu5337\">either grass-eating grazers or leaf-eating browsers</a>, based on the size and shape of their teeth. However, more direct measures of diet – such as stable isotopes or dental microwear – were often lacking. </p>\n\n<p>Our new analyses revealed contrasting dental wear signatures between the two co-occurring ground sloth species. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/learn/nature/ground-sloth.htm\">Harlan’s ground sloth</a>, the larger of the two, had microwear patterns dominated by deep pitlike textures. This kind of wear is indicative of chewing hard, mechanically challenging foods such as tubers, seeds, fungi and fruit pits. Our new evidence aligns with skeletal adaptations that suggest powerful digging abilities, consistent with foraging foods both above and below ground.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"diagram of sloth profiles, tooth outline and magnified surface of two bits of the teeth\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The fossil teeth of the Harlan’s ground sloth typically showed deeper pitlike textures, bottom, while the Shasta ground sloth teeth had shallower wear patterns, top.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2025.0158\">DeSantis and Kurre, Biology Letters 2025</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/giant-ground-sloths.htm\">Shasta ground sloth</a> exhibited dental microwear textures more akin to those in leaf-eating and woody plant-eating herbivores. This pattern corroborates previous studies of its fossilized dung, demonstrating a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.402\">diet rich in desert plants</a> such as yucca, agave and saltbush.  </p>\n\n<p>Next we compared the sloths’ <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.11.019\">microwear textures to those of ungulates</a> such as camels, horses and bison that lived in the same region of Southern California. We confirmed that neither sloth species’ dietary behavior overlapped fully with other herbivores. Giant ground sloths didn’t perform the same ecological functions as the other herbivores that shared their landscape. Instead, both ground sloths partitioned their niches and played complementary ecological roles.</p>\n\n<h2>Extinctions brought ecological loss</h2>\n\n<p>The Harlan’s ground sloth was a megafaunal ecosystem engineer. It excavated soil and foraged underground, thereby affecting soil structure and nutrient cycling, even dispersing seed and fungal spores over wide areas. <a href=\"https://arboretum.harvard.edu/arnoldia-stories/anachronistic-fruits-and-the-ghosts-who-haunt-them/\">Anecdotal evidence</a> suggests that some anachronistic fruits – such as the weird, bumpy-textured and softball-size <a href=\"https://www.earth.com/news/osage-orange-megafauna-extinction/\">Osage orange</a> – were dispersed by ancient megafauna such as giant ground sloths. When the Pleistocene megafauna went extinct, the loss contributed to the regional restriction of these plants, since no one was around to spread their seeds.</p>\n\n<p>The broader consequence is clear: Megafaunal extinctions erased critical ecosystem engineers, triggering cascading ecological changes that continue to affect habitat resilience today. Our results resonate with growing evidence that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.04.024\">preserving today’s living large herbivores</a> and understanding the diversity of their ecological niches is crucial for conserving functional ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Studying the teeth of lost giant ground sloths has illuminated not only their diets but also the enduring ecological legacies of their extinction. Today’s sloths, though charming, only hint at the profound environmental influence of their prehistoric relatives – giants that shaped landscapes in ways we are only beginning to appreciate.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267601/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Larisa R.

Their language was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811987116\">neutral and polished, laced with political jargon</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While populist political communication has become more common <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522\">along with the proliferation of social media</a>, the communication norms are further altered in Trump White House social media posts. </p>\n\n<p>They are partisan, theatrical and exaggerated. Their tone is almost circuslike. The process of governing is portrayed as a reality TV show, in which political roles are performed with little regard for real-world consequences. Vivid color schemes and stylized imagery convert political messaging into visual spectacle. The language is colloquial, down-to-earth. </p>\n\n<p>Just as other influencers in a variety of domains might create an emotional bond by tailoring <a href=\"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/18175/3702\">social media</a> messages, content, products and services to the needs and likes of individual customers, the White House tailors its content to the beliefs, language and worldview of Trump’s political base.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1918502592335724809&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>In doing so, the White House echoes a broad, growing trend in <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1177/13548565241260486\">political communication</a>, portraying Trump as “a champion of the people” and using direct and informal communication that appeals to fear and resentment.  </p>\n\n<p>Trump White House social media makes no effort to promote social unity or constructive dialogue, or reduce polarization – and often heightens it. Undocumented immigrants, for example, are often portrayed as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/the-snake-poem/\">inherently evil</a>. White House social media amplifies dramatic, emotionally charged content. </p>\n\n<p>In one video, Trump recites a poem about <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/the-snake-poem/\">a kind woman who takes in a snake</a>, a stand-in for an immigrant who in reality is a dangerous serpent. “Instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite,” Trump recites.</p>\n\n<h2>Talking to the base</h2>\n\n<p>While some scholars have called the White House social media style “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323116682802\">amateurish</a>,” that hasn’t resulted in change. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of response to negative feedback is partially explained by the strategic goal of these communications: to appeal to the frustrations of Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-billionaire-candidate-and-his-blue-collar-following/432783/\">deeply disaffected political base</a>, which seems to revel in the White House social media style. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1965179520761364626&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Scholars <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/precariat-9780755637072/\">identify a large number of these voters as “the precariat</a>,” a group whose once-stable, union-protected jobs have been outsourced or replaced with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000022\">low-wage, insecure service work</a>.

One example: A White House Valentine’s Day communication that said “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/style/white-house-deportation-memes.html\">and we’ll deport you</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Trump and the White House social media use the president’s status as a celebrity, coupled with comedy and spectacle, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14318/hau6.2.009\">to immunize the administration from fallout</a>, even among some of its critics. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s exaggerated gestures, over-the-top language, his lampooning of opponents and his use of caricature to ridicule whole categories of people – including <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/29/congress/trump-ai-video-deepfake-schumer-jeffries-00586048\">Democrats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/video/2017/01/donald-trump-mocks-disabled-reporter-061897\">the disabled</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/15/short-history-president-trumps-anti-muslim-bigotry/\">Muslims</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer\">Mexicans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-worst-offensive-comments-quotes/\">women</a> – is read by his political base as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/style/trump-officials-social-media.html\">playful and entertaining take down</a> of political correctness. It may form a sturdy pillar of his support. </p>\n\n<p>But prioritizing entertainment over facts has long-term significance. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s communication strategies are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-following-trumps-pre-election-playbook-177863\">already setting a global precedent</a>, encouraging other politicians to adopt similar theatrical and polarizing tactics that distort or deny facts. </p>\n\n<p>These methods may energize some audiences but risk alienating others. Informed political engagement is reduced, and democratic backsliding is increasingly a reality.</p>\n\n<p>Although the communication style of the White House is playful and irreverent, it has a serious goal: the diffusion of ideological messages whose intent is to create a sense of strength and righteousness among its supporters. </p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, this is propaganda designed to persuade citizens that the government is strong, its enemies evil and that fellow citizens – “real Americans” – think the same way. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43664158\">Scholars observe that</a> the White House projection of the often comical images of authority echoes the visual style of authoritarian governments. Both seek to be seen as in control of the social and political order and thereby to discourage dissent. </p>\n\n<p>The chief difference between the two is that in a deeply polarized democracy such as the U.S., citizens interpret these displays of authority in sharply different ways: They build <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S153759272400272X\">opposition among Trump opponents</a> but support among supporters. </p>\n\n<p>The rising intolerance that results erodes social cohesion, undermines support for democratic norms and weakens trust in institutions. And that opens the door to democratic backsliding.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259950/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Everything else – including the broad “police power” to regulate health, safety, morals and general welfare – <a href=\"https://www.jackmillercenter.org/our-work/resources/tenth-amendment\">remained with the states</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet from the beginning, the text has generated plenty of confusion. Is the 10th Amendment merely a “<a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep312/usrep312100/usrep312100.pdf\">truism</a>,” as Justice Harlan Fiske Stone wrote in 1941 in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/312us100\">United States v. Darby</a>, restating the Constitution’s structure of limited powers? Or does it describe concrete powers held by the states?</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, there’s no simple answer, not even from the nation’s highest court. Over the years, the Supreme Court has treated the 10th Amendment like the proverbial magician’s hat, sometimes pulling robust state powers from its depths, other times finding it empty.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The roofline with carvings on it of a large, white, pillared building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Will the Supreme Court justices weigh in on the Trump administration’s attempts to deploy the National Guard?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-u-s-supreme-court-is-shown-march-17-2025-in-washington-news-photo/2205530289?adppopup=true\">Win McNamee/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>10th Amendment’s broad range</h2>\n\n<p>The arguments over the 10th Amendment for almost 200 years have applied not only to the National Guard but to questions about how the federal and state governments share powers over everything from taxation to government salaries, law enforcement and regulation of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>For much of the 19th century, the 10th Amendment remained dormant. The federal government’s weakness and limited ambitions, especially on the slavery question, meant that boundaries were <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt10-3-1/ALDE_00013621/\">rarely tested before the courts</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The New Deal era brought this equilibrium crashing down. </p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court initially resisted the expansion of federal power, striking down laws banning child labor in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/247us251\">Hammer v. Dagenhart</a> in 1918, setting a federal minimum wage in 1923 in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/261us525\">Adkins v. Children’s Hospital</a>, and offering farmers subsidies in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/297us1\">U.S. v. Butler</a> in 1937. All these decisions were based on the 10th Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>But this resistance wore down in the face of economic crisis and political pressure. By the time of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/312us100\">the Darby case in 1941</a>, which concerned the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938\">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> and Congress’ power to regulate many aspects of employment, the court had relegated the 10th Amendment to “truism” status: The Amendment, wrote Stone, did nothing more than restate the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment.</p>\n\n<p>The 1970s marked an unexpected revival. In the 1976 decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1974/74-878\">National League of Cities v. Usery</a>, a dispute over whether Congress could directly exercise control over minimum wage and overtime pay for state and local government employees, the court held that Congress could not use its commerce power to regulate state governments. </p>\n\n<p>But that principle was abandoned nine years later, with the court <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1913\">doubling back on its position</a>. Now, if the states wanted protection from federal overreach, they would have to seek it through the political process, not judicial intervention. </p>\n\n<p>Yet less than a decade later, the court reversed course again. The modern federalism renaissance began in the ’90s with a <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-543\">pair</a> of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-543\">divided opinions</a> stating that the federal government cannot force the states to enforce federal regulatory programs: this was the “anti-commandeering principle.” </p>\n\n<h2>The 10th Amendment’s meandering path</h2>\n\n<p>In recent decades, the court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, has invoked the amendment to protect state power in varied, even surprising contexts: states’ entitlement to <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/resource/the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-acas-medicaid-expansion-qa/\">federal Medicaid spending</a>; state <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.36644/mlr.114.7.inventing\">authority over running elections</a>, despite patterns of voter exclusion; even <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10133\">legalization of sports gambling</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in 2024, Colorado was barred by the court from <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/trump-v-anderson-2/\">excluding Trump from the presidential ballot</a> as part of its power to administer elections.</p>\n\n<p>That brings us back to the present, where Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/chicago-portland-trump-national-guard-deployments-court-hearings-rcna236201\">bids to send them to Portland and Chicago</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>From the point of view of federalism, two factors lend this conflict some constitutional complexity.</p>\n\n<p>One is the National Guard’s dual state-federal character. Most Guard mobilizations, including disaster relief, take place under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32\">Title 32 of the U.S. Code</a>, which maintains state control of troops with federal funding. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section12406&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\">Title 10</a> allows the president to assert federal control over Guard units in case of “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406\">a rebellion or danger of a rebellion</a>” against the government or where “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”</p>\n\n<p>The other factor is political. </p>\n\n<p>Since World War II, the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/national-guard-troops-uses.html\">has been deployed only 10 times</a> by presidents, mostly in support of racial desegregation and the protection of civil rights. All but one of these mobilizations came at the governor’s request – the lone exception, pre-Trump, being President Dwight Eisenhower’s 1957 mobilization of <a href=\"https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/civil-rights-little-rock-school-integration-crisis\">the Arkansas National Guard to desegregate schools</a> in Little Rock over the wishes of Gov. Orval Faubus. </p>\n\n<p>In sharp contrast, Trump has now attempted three times to send troops to large cities over the explicit objection of Democratic governors. Such is the case in Portland. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man with sandy hair dressed in a blue jacket, white shirt and red tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump has faced lawsuits when deploying the National Guard to states with Democratic governors.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TrumpUSAustralia/a8c1fb4959fa4b8aad38f5e86234e141/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Evan Vucci</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>National Guard deployments and constitutional stakes</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/28/oregon-sues-block-trump-national-guard-portland-00583937\">Oregon’s lawsuit</a> argues that there is no national emergency in the city, and that deploying Guard troops to the state without Gov.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, maps were <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/26325\">central to the ethnic cleansing</a> that took place in the early 1990s, driving visions of creating mono-ethnic space through violence, and also to the ending of the war. Similarly, in the Caucasus, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Near-Abroad-Contest-Ukraine-Caucasus/dp/0190253304\">cartographic fantasies of homogeneous territories</a> have underwritten campaigns against ethnic others in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>\n\n<p>And it is no surprise that maps are a critical part of negotiations now to end the 3½-year conflict in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2>Creative cartography</h2>\n\n<p>Drawing partition lines on maps has always been a feature of stalemated territorial conflicts. U.S. negotiators in 1995 <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/bih/126173\">forged the agreement</a> that brought Bosnia’s war to an end through last-minute cartographic adjustments ensuring that the settlement conformed to an already agreed-upon <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bosnia_Remade/y2ReAwAAQBAJ?hl=en\">49-51 percentage split of the territory</a> between Bosnian-Serb forces and those representing the Bosnian Federation.</p>\n\n<p>Dividing territory in percentage terms, however, goes against the grain of how most people view their territorial homelands. In his famous account of <a href=\"https://ia601200.us.archive.org/25/items/benedict-anderson-imagined-communities/Benedict-Anderson-Imagined%20Communities.pdf\">nations as “imagined communities</a>,” the Anglo-Irish historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/01/benedict-anderson\">Benedict Anderson</a> described how states create nations through the widespread circulation of a common territorial map. In this way, map images became a type of state logo. Nations not only imagined themselves as a community but as belonging to a particular recognizable space, a familiar territorial homeland.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two people take a selfie in front of an outline of a map made with flowers.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A decorative map of Ukraine made with flowers in Kyiv on Aug. 23, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/couple-makes-selfie-at-a-decorative-map-of-ukraine-made-news-photo/2230751661?adppopup=true\">Sergei SupinskyAFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Territories in today’s world have become instantly recognizable shapes on posters and T-shirts and in textbooks. Yet they are also experienced as something alive and personal – a “<a href=\"https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/siam-mapped-a-history-of-the-geo-body-of-a-nation/\">geo-body</a>,” in the words of Thai historian Thongchai Winichakul.</p>\n\n<p>It is part of what leads citizens, and nations, to feel deeply connected to their state’s territorial boundaries. And it helps explain the generally persistent resistance of Ukrainians to territorial concessions to Russia – even though there are signs that popular <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2025.2538481\">sentiment is beginning to shift</a> after 3½ years of war.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting and dying for a homeland, as Ukrainian soldiers have done in their thousands, adds to the emotive power of territory. To many Ukrainians it isn’t property they are being asked to concede but sacred and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/indivisibleterri0000godd/page/n5/mode/2up\">indivisible land</a> paid for with blood.</p>\n\n<p>This understanding of territory is quite different from that of Trump and his handpicked cadre of “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/jared-kushner-gaza-deal.html\">deal guys</a>” who treat international conflict like short-term business transactions.</p>\n\n<h2>Misreading the map</h2>\n\n<p>This pursuit of a deal over other considerations has a downside and can lead to missteps. Trump’s special envoy for peace missions, Steve Witkoff, believed he had achieved something of a breakthrough during a meeting with the Russians in early August when looking at areas where Russia might withdraw on the map. German newspaper Bild reported that Witkoff, who does not speak Russian and didn’t have his own translator, <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland-und-internationales/friedlicher-rueckzug-hat-trumps-mann-putin-falsch-verstanden-6895de301174f91cb081eb54\">misunderstood Putin’s demand</a> of a “peaceful withdrawal” of Ukrainians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as an offer of Russia’s “peaceful withdrawal” from those regions.</p>\n\n<p>Because it led to the postponement of new U.S. sanctions and a summit proposal, the Russians went along with the misunderstanding, according to the Bild’s reporting.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the subsequent Alaska summit was not the breakthrough Trump envisioned. Putin got the red-carpet treatment on U.S. soil but nonetheless subjected Trump to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7af3b49e-c4da-405b-8199-3e12957b78c2\">a lengthy historical lecture on why Russia owns Ukraine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Putin was unwilling to give Trump the ceasefire deal the U.S. president desired. Putin did, however, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putins-demand-ukraine-give-up-donbas-no-nato-no-western-troops-sources-say-2025-08-21/\">make a territorial proposal</a> that kept Trump interested in continuing to play the peacemaker: If Russia acquired all of the territory of the two oblasts that made up the Donbas, then Russia would consider freezing its lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p>\n\n<h2>Haggling over percentiles</h2>\n\n<p>This provided the background for an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/18/us/trump-zelensky-ukraine-putin\">extraordinary meeting in the White House</a> on Aug. 18, 2025, when seven European leaders joined Zelenskyy in meeting Trump to discuss a possible endgame to the war. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian delegation was <a href=\"https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/08/18/1609568.html\">pictured entering the White House </a> with what looked like a rolled-up map. In the Oval Office, however, they were confronted with the White House’s own <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeynw8jppdo\">rigid board depicting a map of the “Russia-Ukraine Conflict</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>It featured a <a href=\"https://data.europa.eu/apps/data-visualisation-guide/choropleth-maps\">choropleth display</a> with the estimated territory under Russian occupation colored in orange and quantified as a percentage figure of each oblast’s territory. The map indicated that Russia occupied 99% of Luhansk and 76% of Donetsk. Putin wanted 100% of both – a demand that required Ukraine to surrender the fortified territories safeguarding central Ukraine.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A map is shown in front of a bust and various people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A close-up of the White House map showing percentiles over various Ukrainian regions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/p20250818dt-2178_54732163195_o_fb8a69.jpg\">The White House</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>What the Oval Office map meant to Trump was clear the following day in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kKnpQpKI-oE?si=hQvjW0JujfIu2bGK\">phone interview on “Fox and Friends</a>.” Referring to the map, he said that a “big chunk of territory is taken,” implying it is now lost to Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the map recorded the score in real estate terms from a regrettable war between a small state and a much larger one. </p>\n\n<p>Zelenskyy tried to argue for a different approach to map issues, one that affirmed the symbolic and strategic importance of keeping Ukraine’s territorial integrity alive as an ideal for Ukrainians and the international community. </p>\n\n<p>He made some progress. After meeting Zelenskyy at the United Nations on Sept. 23, Trump suggested that Ukraine could succeed in its fight to “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine.html\">take back their country in its original form</a>.”</p>\n\n<h2>Battlegrounds as real estate</h2>\n\n<p>With Trump seemingly drifting toward supporting Ukraine with long-range missiles, Putin seized the initiative by phoning Trump. In an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-putin-cease-fire-ukraine.html\">extensive phone call</a> prior to Zelenskyy’s White House visit on Oct. 17, the Russian leader updated his offer for peace, suggesting his forces would withdraw from Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in return for all of the Donbas region. </p>\n\n<p>This set the stage for the latest reported Trump-Zelenskyy shouting match and the tossing aside of front-line maps. </p>\n\n<p>Afterward, <a href=\"https://www.trumpstruth.org/statuses/33340\">Trump posted on social media</a>: “… it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are.” </p>\n\n<p>This is Trump’s current position on map issues. Backing off pressuring Ukraine to give up all the Donbas in public, he believes that Ukraine and the Donbas should be “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-gas-strikes-energy-50826ce7b96814ad943d8721c1a2915c\">cut up” along the current battlelines</a>. Asked in a Fox News <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/11485009/trump-ukraine-potential-land-exchange-russia-peace/\">interview on Oct. 6</a> whether Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he’s going to take something. They fought and he has a lot of property. He’s won certain property.”</p>\n\n<p>This gets at how Zelenskyy and Trump seemingly see different things when they look at front-line maps. The Ukrainian leader sees a painful reality, his country’s geo-body violently cut apart by an invading, occupying power. Trump comments indicate he sees it as a property dispute in which the strongest power has accumulated some territorial winnings and now needs to cash them in.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265798/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gerard Toal in the past received funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Research Council of Norway. </span></em></p>",

The study of gender represents the kind of free inquiry that allows people to decide for themselves how to live, free of coercion or government control. </p>\n\n<h2>What is ‘gender ideology’?</h2>\n\n<p>“Gender ideology” is a catch-all term <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2017/12/11/gender-ideology-tracking-its-origins-and-meanings-in-current-gender-politics/\">conservative Catholics initially promoted in the 1990s</a> in response to the United Nations’ promotion of women’s equality. </p>\n\n<p>In 2004, pushing back on the global women’s and gay rights movements, the Vatican declared in a <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040731_collaboration_en.html\">letter to bishops</a> that men and women are different by nature “not only on the physical level, but also on the psychological and spiritual.” The letter stated that the idea of gender “inspired ideologies” that sanction alternatives to the traditional two-parent family headed by men and treated homosexuality on par with heterosexuality.</p>\n\n<p>Over the following decades, evangelical groups and far-right parties across the globe – from <a href=\"https://politicalcapital.hu/news.php?article_read=1&amp;article_id=3037\">Hungary</a> and <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/rag/15/2/article-p113_1.xml\">Russia</a> to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X20000070\">Peru</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2024/02/06/anti-gender-ideology-and-neo-liberal-state-grammar-in-brazil/\">Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/2024/02/27/who-is-afraid-of-gender-study-on-gender-ideology-and-the-anti-gender-campaigns-that-support-it-in-burkina-faso-ghana-and-senegal/\">Ghana</a> – have used the language of combating “gender ideology” to counter a host of social policies, including sex education in schools, the legalization of gay marriage and same-sex adoption, reproductive rights and transgender rights. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Crowd of people, center of which is a sign depicting silhouette figures of a man and a woman holding an umbrella shielding two children from a rainbow\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Anti-gender protestors during a 2018 Equality March in Kraków, Poland.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:02018_Nationalists,_anti-gay_protesters_during_the_%22Equality_March%22_in_Krak%C3%B3w.jpg\">Silar/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/asequals/anti-gender-equality-threat-explained-as-equals-intl-cmd/\">anti-gender movement</a> is no longer fringe but rather <a href=\"https://untoday.org/backlash-unfiltered-pushing-equality-forwards/\">well funded, organized and transnational</a>. For example, 40 countries have signed the <a href=\"https://womenshealth.gov/geneva-consensus-declaration\">Geneva Consensus Declaration</a>, an international pact proposed by the first Trump administration and supported by anti-gender campaigners as a way to <a href=\"https://fosfeminista.org/news-and-stories/beyond-the-global-gag-rule/\">deny abortion rights internationally</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., where the majority of Americans <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/646202/sex-relations-marriage-supported.aspx\">support gay marriage</a> <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx\">and abortion rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html\">targeting trans rights</a> has become one of the conservative movement’s galvanizing issues. A <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country\">flood of state bills</a> not only ban books and discussions of gender, sexuality and race in schools but also criminalize abortion, ban gender-affirming health care and legalize discrimination in housing and employment on religious grounds. </p>\n\n<h2>What we talk about when we talk about gender</h2>\n\n<p>How gender is researched and taught in universities <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/europe-far-right-target-gender-studies/591208/\">has become</a> <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2024/04/05/more-students-take-gender-studies-even-it-comes-under-attack\">a key target</a> of anti-gender campaigns across the globe, in part because the study of gender raises questions about the universality of traditional social roles and the inequalities that can result from them.</p>\n\n<p>Gender is a focus of inquiry not only in gender studies classes but in literature, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/home/GAS\">sociology</a>, <a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/academics/journals/journal-gender-and-law\">law</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-gender\">government</a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680424\">history</a>, anthropology and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/cgpc20\">cultural geography</a>, among <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/what-gender-studies-is-and-how-to-use-the-degree\">many other fields</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/7303210/religious-opposition-trans-healthcare-new/\">Anti-gender campaigners argue</a> there is nothing to understand about it because gender is given by nature or God. For them, gender is equivalent to sex, which is taken to be straightforward and without exception male or female.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific evidence suggests, however, that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/are-trans-women-biologically-male-the-answer-is-complicated-244465\">sex is not always binary</a>. In biology, sex refers to genes, reproductive organs, hormone systems and observable physical characteristics; different combinations of these lead to variations in sex. Far from straightforward, then, sex is complicated. </p>\n\n<p>And a person’s assigned sex at birth does not always align with their deeply held sense of self – their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/genetic-testing-cannot-reveal-the-gender-of-your-baby-two-genetic-counselors-explain-the-complexities-of-sex-and-gender-217631\">gender identity</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Gender is both a feature of individual people and a <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/ccf/2019/04/30/gender-structures-every-aspect-of-life/\">mode of organizing social life</a>. At the individual level, people have a subjective sense of and embody their gender by dressing and behaving in ways that encourage other people to see them as they want to be seen. A man might wear a tie at the office to convey masculinity. People will interact differently with a woman when she is wearing high heels and makeup than when she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/style/pamela-anderson-no-makeup-vanity-fair.html\">goes barefaced</a> or dons <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019343453/women-sports-sexualization-uniforms-problem\">a swimsuit</a>. Someone who is <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gender-fluidity-what-it-means-and-why-support-matters-2020120321544\">gender fluid</a> may appear more masculine or feminine at different times and experience prejudice and discrimination. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/swSy6pdAS-0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Gender roles shape society and culture in both subtle and glaring ways.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Gender <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/ccf/2019/04/30/gender-structures-every-aspect-of-life/\">shapes societies</a> through norms and rules on everything from what you wear to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/gender-and-parenting/\">how families operate</a>, whom you are allowed to partner with and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/02/15/chart-the-most-gendered-occupations\">what jobs you are likely to hold</a>. Whether in the spheres of culture, family, economic or civic life, gender roles and norms intersect with class, race and other social differences and shift across cultures and historical eras. Indigenous societies across the globe have long recognized more than two gender categories, and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/\">historical and contemporary examples of gender diversity</a> abound. </p>\n\n<p>A ban on learning about gender would sweep aside all this variation in favor of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/antagonism-to-transgender-rights-is-tied-to-the-authoritarian-desire-for-social-conformity-not-just-partisan-affiliation-257431\">homogeneous worldview</a> that deliberately ignores biology, history and lived experience. Denying the diversity of gender makes it easier to impose a conservative worldview and roll back rights.</p>\n\n<h2>Education as a political target</h2>\n\n<p>Anti-gender campaigners view education as a <a href=\"https://www.ei-ie.org/en/item/28600:education-a-key-battleground-for-anti-gender-activists\">major battleground</a> in the fight over societal values. In the U.S., conservative efforts to ban the study of gender and sexuality initially centered on K-12 education, exemplified in bills such as Florida’s 2022 “<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/05/how-floridas-expansion-of-dont-say-gay-law-will-hurt.html\">Don’t Say Gay” law</a>. But the movement has also affected <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mccarthyisms-shadow-looms-over-controversial-firing-of-texas-professor-who-taught-about-gender-identity-265554\">colleges and universities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Texas A&amp;M’s president <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/19/texas-a-m-welsh-firing-professor-gender-mccoul/\">fired a professor</a> in September 2025 after a student recorded her confrontation with her for discussing gender diversity in a literature course. The student alleged the course was “not legal” because it contradicted “our president’s laws” and her own religious beliefs. The university president also later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/texas-am-president-gender-ideology-controversy.html\">resigned under pressure</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The same month, the chancellor of the Texas Tech University system, citing Trump’s executive order on “gender ideology,” <a href=\"https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/abfdd9310a3422570992857b5b830f2b/Texas%20Tech%20System%20letter.pdf\">banned all faculty members</a> across its five universities from recognizing “more than two sexes” in any course or classroom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Crowd of protestors holding signs inside a capitol building\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Controlling thought is a means of repressing social movements.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TransgenderCivilRights/1787e5c3030a4fe3ba003dca1995666c/photo\">AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As the Texas chapter of the American Association of University Professors reminds its members, faculty have a <a href=\"https://aaup-texas.org/blog/f/faculty-rights-standing-against-censorship\">constitutional right to teach and discuss</a> “all matters related to the subject matter of a class” without interference from administrators, politicians or government officials.

This is a spatial skill that developmental psychologists call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119171492.wecad029\">mental rotation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Whether a person is navigating a new city or doing a cartwheel, they must use mental rotation skills to move shapes or objects in their mind and make sense of where their bodies are going and what surrounds them. </p>\n\n<p>When children play with puzzles, building blocks  or pattern games, they are also practicing mental rotation. </p>\n\n<p>Over time, these skills <a href=\"https://learningsuccess.ai/spatial-reasoning/\">support learning</a> in math, science and reading. This can look like visualizing pulley systems in physics or seeing the differences between <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16306024/\">similar-looking letters</a> such as b and d, which young children often confuse.  </p>\n\n<p>Strong mental rotation skills also lay the foundation for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01938\">doing well in school</a> and developing <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2009-19591-005.html\">interest in careers</a> in science, technology, engineering and math. </p>\n\n<p>Most preschool-age children are not yet learning to read – but it turns out they are still using some of these same spatial reasoning skills as they think about the world around them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FhjYx3EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">We are scholars of</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTpp8cUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">developmental science</a> and were curious to find out how children as young as 3 years old mentally rotate objects. </p>\n\n<p>While there is research on the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201413000476\">age at which children can mentally</a> rotate objects, less is understood about how children are solving mental rotation problems. We found in our research, conducted from 2022 to 2023, that young children are using the same problem-solving <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxlm0000574\">strategies as adults</a> when they solve a mental rotation task. </p>\n\n<h2>Children think visually, just like adults</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.70018\">We used eye-tracking technology</a> to understand how a sample of 148 children, all between 3 and 7 years old, solved different mental rotation problems. Eye-trackers use harmless infrared light to capture eye movements. This technology lets us observe how children solve these problems in real time. </p>\n\n<p>As part of our study, we showed each child a large picture of items such as a fire truck, as well as two smaller pictures of the same truck, one placed above the other and positioned slightly differently.</p>\n\n<p>Children were asked to say which small picture on the right matched the large one on the left. In this example, the correct answer is the top picture, because that top fire truck can be rotated to match the large fire truck. The bottom fire truck was a mirrored image, and no matter how much you rotate it, it will never match the large fire truck. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Children looked at pictures of fire trucks as part of a research study to assess how they manipulated the object in their heads.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Karinna Rodriguez</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While the children thought about their response, the eye-tracker, mounted right below the computer screen, recorded their eye movements. </p>\n\n<p>By looking at where and for how long children looked at each image, we figured out what kind of strategy they were using. </p>\n\n<p>Some children focused on fewer parts of the object and spent less time studying its details.

Parents can <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2023/the-power-of-play\">help children</a> by offering them opportunities to practice rotating real objects with toys such as three-dimensional puzzles or building blocks. Tangrams – flat, colorful puzzles that come in different shapes – can be used to practice breaking down shapes of animals into pieces. Parents can encourage their child to look for shapes that match parts of the animal or object they are building. </p>\n\n<p>Nov. 8 is <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/aasl/advocacy/promo/STEM\">International STEM Day</a>, a celebration of all things science, technology, engineering and mathematics. </p>\n\n<p>Research like ours provides valuable guidance for designing early STEM activities and educational tools. By directly observing children’s problem solving in real time, we can develop better ways for educators and toy makers to support strong spatial thinking from an early age. To celebrate, we encourage people to engage in activities that test their spatial skills, such as ditching the GPS for the day or <a href=\"https://www.freetetris.org/game.php\">playing a game of Tetris</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Mental rotation is a powerful skill that helps us understand and interact with the surrounding physical world. From solving puzzles to reading maps, mental rotation plays a role in many everyday activities. Building mental rotation abilities can improve children’s performance in subjects such as reading, math and science and may inspire future careers in STEM fields.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264532/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Pruden receives funding from National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development and National Science Foundation. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Karinna Rodriguez does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That’s according to our new research examining whether homes destroyed in Colorado’s <a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/looking-back-at-colorados-marshall-fire/\">Marshall Fire</a> — which burned more than 1,000 houses in suburban Boulder County — have been rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://www.tonycookson.com/\">economists</a> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/emgallag/\">who study</a> the financial resources available to households to cope with disasters, including insurance, crowdfunding and federal disaster aid.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past five years, insurance premiums in <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2024/09/07/colorado-homeowners-insurance-costs-premiums/\">Colorado rose nearly 60%</a>, driven by mounting losses from wildfire, hail and other disasters. These patterns are not unique to Colorado. They reflect a broader <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/insurance-for-homeowners-premium-rates/\">national reassessment of risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our new research sheds light on this issue by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5057551\">linking confidential, contract-level data</a> to real rebuilding outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Our study analyzes 3,089 policies from 14 major insurers held by people affected by the Marshall Fire. The findings offer concrete steps homeowners can take now to reduce the risk of holding insufficient coverage. </p>\n\n<h2>How common is underinsurance?</h2>\n\n<p>Underinsurance is determined by comparing the amount of coverage a homeowner carries to rebuild the physical structure of their home to the actual cost of rebuilding after a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>To estimate each unique home’s rebuilding cost, the study used construction-cost software and adjusted the estimates to align with a sample of real-world construction quotes received by homeowners after the Marshall Fire. </p>\n\n<p>We found that 74% of homeowners affected by the Marshall Fire were underinsured, and 36% were so severely underinsured that their policy covered less than 75% of the rebuild cost.</p>\n\n<p>According <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5057551\">to our research</a>, underinsurance was not just a problem for poorer households. Even for households with incomes above US$180,000, 72% held policies that did not cover the cost of a complete rebuild. </p>\n\n<p>Credit scores and mortgage debt amounts were unrelated to how underinsured people were.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Dozens of homes are in various stages of being built.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">After the Marshall Fire, hundreds of homes were being rebuilt at once, which drove the costs of rebuilding up.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/louisville-colorado-rebuilding-is-underway-a-year-after-news-photo/2217534380?adppopup=true\">UCG/GettyImages</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>After major fires, construction costs typically spike as hundreds of survivors rebuild at once. To help manage this risk, many <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/underinsurance-homes-los-angeles-20363535.php\">homeowners purchase an Extended Replacement Cost policy</a>, which boosts coverage by a set percentage of the existing coverage limit if rebuilding costs end up higher than the coverage limit. </p>\n\n<p>Eighty-seven percent of the Marshall Fire policies we studied included extended coverage. But nearly three-quarters of them still <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2025/06/06/826665.htm\">fell short of covering the full cost to rebuild</a>. Our study found that while extended coverage policies cushion the impact of postfire construction cost inflation, they do not solve the deeper problem of underinsurance. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, even without the surge in costs, most households had bought too little coverage from the outset.</p>\n\n<h2>Price shopping vs. the coverage you actually need</h2>\n\n<p>Our research finds that the insurance company a household chooses strongly predicts how much coverage the household has. That’s even after accounting for income, mortgage status, credit score, home value and property characteristics. In other words, insurers differ systematically in the coverage levels they tend to provide. </p>\n\n<p>When shopping, homeowners attend to the headline premium, or the total cost of insurance, but not to how much coverage that premium actually buys. Indeed, if shoppers compared insurer quotes for the same coverage amount, they would gain about $290 per year in value, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32579\">roughly 10% of the average annual</a> homeowners insurance premium. </p>\n\n<h2>Why underinsurance slows recovery</h2>\n\n<p>Underinsurance isn’t an abstract problem offset by savings, loans and federal aid. It leaves real gaps in rebuilding. </p>\n\n<p>The study found that when a household’s insurance coverage falls short of the home’s replacement cost, the household is significantly less likely to rebuild after a total loss.

Construction <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/02/03/marshall-fire-survivors-face-high-costs-supply-shortages-as-they-look-to-rebuild/\">costs in the region rose steeply</a> in the lead-up to the Marshall Fire due to the pandemic and related inflation. If you haven’t updated your coverage recently, revisit it annually — especially if you remodeled or added square footage. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjwn0KsgeE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A good explainer of how to make a home inventory from the Minnesota Department of Commerce.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Consider insurer reputation and local presence. Different insurance companies will suggest different coverage limits for the exact same property. The study finds that companies with deeper roots in the community are less likely to underinsure, likely due to concerns about their reputation — something worth weighing alongside price. </p>\n\n<p>The Front Range will continue to face wildfire seasons where <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/r02/fire/prevention/confronting-wildfire-crisis\">wind, drought and human ignition</a> interact in populated areas, and premiums are unlikely to snap back quickly. For households, the most practical step is to shop for insurance and renew policies as if a total loss could happen tomorrow.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263702/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tony Cookson received funding from the National Bureau of Economic Research Household Finance Small Grants Program. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Emily Gallagher is affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

For generations, people have believed that the Moon has the power to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/full-moon-effects?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stir up sleepless nights and strange behavior</a> – even madness itself. The word “lunacy” comes directly from luna, Latin for Moon. </p>\n\n<p>Police officers, hospital staff and emergency workers often swear that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-really-believe-bad-things-happen-on-a-full-moon-1476719218\">their nights get busier under a full moon</a>. But does science back that up? </p>\n\n<p>The answer is, of course, more nuanced than folklore suggests. Research shows a full moon can modestly affect sleep, but its influence on mental health is much less certain.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">neurologist specializing in sleep medicine</a> who studies how sleep affects brain health. I find it captivating that an ancient myth about moonlight and madness might trace back to something far more ordinary: our restless, moonlit sleep.</p>\n\n<h2>What the full moon really does to sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Several studies show that people really do sleep differently in the days leading up to the full moon, when moonlight shines brightest in the evening sky. During this period, people <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.029\">sleep about 20 minutes less</a>, take longer to fall asleep and <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2014.06.020\">spend less time in deep, restorative sleep</a>. Large population studies <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe0465\">confirm the pattern</a>, finding that people across different cultures tend to go to bed later and sleep for shorter periods in the nights before a full moon. </p>\n\n<p>The most likely reason is light. A bright moon in the evening can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1897609\">delay the body’s internal clock, reduce melatonin</a> – the hormone that signals bedtime – and keep the brain more alert.</p>\n\n<p>The changes are modest. Most people lose only 15 to 30 minutes of sleep, but the effect is measurable. It is <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe0465\">strongest in places without artificial light</a>, such as rural areas or while camping. Some research also suggests that <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150222\">men and women may be affected differently</a>. For instance, men seem to lose more sleep during the waxing phase, while women experience slightly less deep and restful sleep around the full moon.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young adult woman lying in bed wide awake, staring out the window toward a bright light.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sleep loss from a bright moon is modest but measurable.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/disturbed-annoyed-african-american-young-woman-royalty-free-image/2200045224?phrase=tossing%20and%20turning%20sleep&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Yuliia Kaveshnikova/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The link with mental health</h2>\n\n<p>For centuries, people have blamed the full moon for stirring up madness. Folklore suggested that <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0327(99)00016-6\">its glow could spark</a> <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2016.263\">mania in bipolar disorder</a>, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000210482.75864.e8\">provoke seizures in people with epilepsy</a> or trigger <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2019.1625054\">psychosis in those with schizophrenia</a>. The theory was simple: lose sleep under a bright moon and vulnerable minds might unravel. </p>\n\n<p>Modern science adds an important twist. Research is clear that sleep loss itself is a powerful driver of mental health problems. Even one rough night can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsae091\">heighten anxiety and drag down mood</a>. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101429\">Ongoing sleep disruption</a> raises the risk of depression, suicidal thoughts and flare-ups of conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.</p>\n\n<p>That means even the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.029\">modest sleep loss</a> seen around a full moon could matter more for people who are already at risk. Someone with bipolar disorder, for example, may be far <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.12.098\">more sensitive to shortened or fragmented sleep</a> than the average person.</p>\n\n<p>But here’s the catch: When researchers step back and look at large groups of people, the evidence that lunar phases trigger psychiatric crises is weak. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20070\">No reliable pattern has been found</a> between the Moon and hospital admissions, discharges or lengths of stay.</p>\n\n<p>But a few other studies suggest there may be small effects. In India, psychiatric hospitals recorded <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1849253\">more use of restraints</a> during full moons, based on data collected between 2016 and 2017. In China, researchers noted a <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2019.1625054\">slight rise in schizophrenia admissions</a> around the full moon, using hospital records from 2012 to 2017. Still, these findings are not consistent worldwide and may reflect cultural factors or local hospital practices as much as biology. </p>\n\n<p>In the end, the Moon may shave a little time off our sleep, and sleep loss can certainly influence mental health, especially for people who are more vulnerable. That includes those with conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or epilepsy, and teenagers who are especially sensitive to sleep disruption. But the idea that the full moon directly drives waves of psychiatric illness remains more myth than reality.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q17i1srjOqY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The sleep/wake cycle is synchronized with lunar phases.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Other theories fall short</h2>\n\n<p>Over the years, scientists have explored other explanations for supposed lunar effects, from <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.003\">gravitational “tidal” pulls</a> on the body to <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.0324\">subtle geomagnetic changes</a> and <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-025-02954-z\">shifts in barometric pressure</a>. Yet, none of these mechanisms hold up under scrutiny. </p>\n\n<p>The gravitational forces that move oceans are far too weak to affect human physiology, and studies of geomagnetic and atmospheric changes during lunar phases have yielded inconsistent or negligible results. This makes sleep disruption from <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2017.00189\">nighttime light exposure</a> the most plausible link between the Moon and human behavior.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the myth lingers</h2>\n\n<p>If the science is so inconclusive, why do so many people believe in the “full moon effect”? Psychologists point to a concept called <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00016-6\">illusory correlation</a>. We notice and remember the unusual nights that coincide with a full moon but forget the many nights when nothing happened.</p>\n\n<p>The Moon is also highly visible. Unlike hidden sleep disruptors such as <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.08.024\">stress</a>, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2023.101764\">caffeine</a> or <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.2493\">scrolling on a phone</a>, the Moon is right there in the sky, easy to blame.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman staring at her cellphone while lying in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Screen-time habits are far more likely to have detrimental effects on sleep than a full moon.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-using-a-mobile-phone-while-lying-in-bed-at-royalty-free-image/1423376521?phrase=screens%20nightime%20sleep&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">FanPro/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lessons from the Moon for modern sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Even if the Moon does not drive us “mad,” its small influence on sleep highlights something important: Light at night matters.</p>\n\n<p>Our bodies are designed to follow the natural cycle of light and dark. Extra light in the evening, whether from moonlight, streetlights or phone screens, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00877-7\">can delay circadian rhythms</a>, reduce melatonin and lead to lighter, more fragmented sleep.</p>\n\n<p>This same biology helps explain the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8780\">health risks of daylight saving time</a>. When clocks “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-the-days-of-springing-forward-be-numbered-a-neurologist-and-sleep-expert-explains-the-downside-to-that-borrowed-hour-of-daylight-224597\">spring forward</a>,” evenings stay artificially brighter. That shift <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-daylight-saving-time-is-unhealthy-a-neurologist-explains-175427\">delays sleep and disrupts circadian timing</a> on a much larger scale than the Moon, contributing to increased <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/daylight-saving-time-and-early-school-start-times-cost-billions-in-lost-productivity-and-health-care-expenses-248280\">accidents and cardiovascular risks, as well as reduced workplace safety</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In our modern world, artificial light has a much bigger impact on sleep than the Moon ever will. That is why many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.10898\">sleep experts argue for permanent standard time</a>, which better matches our biological rhythms.</p>\n\n<p>So if you find yourself restless on a full moon night, you may not be imagining things – the Moon can tug at your sleep. But if sleeplessness happens often, look closer to home. It is likely a culprit of the light in your hand rather than the one in the sky.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267528/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Countries worldwide are experiencing intensifying storms, dangerous heat waves and rising seas as global temperatures rise.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, after 30 years of international climate talks, 10 years of a <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">global treaty</a> promising to keep temperatures in check, and <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/\">trillions of dollars in damage</a>, the world is still not on track to stop rising global temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions were at <a href=\"https://wmo.int/publication-series/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin-no-21\">record highs in 2024</a>, and it was Earth’s <a href=\"https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level\">hottest year on record</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dornsife.online.usc.edu/sm/faculty/shannon-gibson/\">I study</a> the dynamics of global environmental politics, including the United Nations climate negotiations. And I and my lab have been tracking countries’ latest climate pledges – known as <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs\">nationally determined contributions</a>, or NDCs – to see which countries have stepped up their efforts, which have slid back and who has ideas that can deliver a safer world for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>While the Trump administration has been <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/09/not-up-for-discussion-brussels-rejects-washingtons-pressure-on-climate-rules\">pressuring countries</a> to back away from their climate commitments – and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/climate/shipping-pollution-fee-international-maritime-organization.html\">succeeded in delaying an International Maritime Organization vote</a> on a global plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions from shipping after <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/taking-action-to-defend-america-from-the-uns-first-global-carbon-tax-the-international-maritime-organizations-imo-net-zero-framework-nzf\">threatening other counties with sanctions, visa restrictions and port fees</a> if they supported it – many countries are still pressing ahead. </p>\n\n<h2>Trump agitates, but many countries are steadfast</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration came into office vowing to <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/trump-issues-executive-order-climate-change-0\">eliminate climate regulations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\">boost the fossil fuel industry</a>, derided concerns about climate change in his Sept. 23, 2025, speech to the U.N. General Assembly. He called climate change the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9I5yfQUQ7U\">greatest con job ever perpetuated”</a> and ridiculed green energy and climate science.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s language no longer surprises world leaders, though. More than 100 other countries <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-summit-2025\">announced new climate commitments</a> during a high-level summit a few days later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>China</strong>, currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, was lauded for <a href=\"https://www.renewableinstitute.org/china-surpasses-2030-renewable-energy-goals-years-ahead-of-schedule/\">hitting its green energy targets five years early</a>. Its rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and electric vehicle manufacturing has reduced pollution in Chinese cities while also boosting its economy and expanding the government’s influence around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country’s <a href=\"http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2025-09/25/c_1128276.htm\">first absolute emissions reduction goal</a> at the summit, committing to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035. China also committed to nearly triple its solar and wind power capacity and expand reforestation efforts.</p>\n\n<p>While advocates and other governments had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/chinas-new-climate-target-falls-well-short-eu-says-2025-09-25/\">hoped for a stronger announcement</a> from China, the new goals mark an important shift from the country’s earlier carbon intensity targets, which aimed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output but still allowed emissions to grow over time.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vqYwv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vqYwv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><strong>The European Union</strong> has yet to submit its new commitments, but the group of 27 European countries <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/09/18/paris-agreement-eu-submits-statement-of-intent-to-the-unfccc-on-the-post-2030-ndc/#:%7E:text=Background,(NDCs)%20(UNFCCC%20website)\">delivered a letter of intent</a>, saying it would commit to a 66% to 72% collective decrease in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Europe has seen a swift rise in renewable energy, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/russias-war-on-ukraine\">up sharply since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a> put the continent’s natural gas supplies in jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p>The EU has also made waves by extending its carbon pricing rules beyond its borders.</p>\n\n<p>The EU’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/carbon-border-tax-us-china-and-india-lash-out-at-eu-climate-policy.html\">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a>, scheduled to begin in January 2026, will be the first system to charge for the climate impact of imported goods coming into Europe from countries that don’t have carbon prices similar to the EU’s. The measure, meant to even the playing field for EU industries, sets a global precedent for linking carbon emissions to trade. </p>\n\n<p>However, the EU’s climate plans are also facing some headwinds. Its parliament is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-parliament-plans-cut-back-sustainability-law-further-2025-10-08/\">moving toward softening</a> new corporate sustainability requirements <a href=\"https://www.netzeroinvestor.net/news-and-views/eu-policy-makers-back-down-on-transition-plans-amid-us-pressure\">after pressure from companies</a>. And it may face calls from some member countries to <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/10/20/eu-nations-to-push-for-delay-to-controversial-new-carbon-market-00613488\">delay a new carbon market meant</a> to cut emissions from road transportation and buildings, Politico reported.</p>\n\n<p>The EU has pledged to mobilize <a href=\"https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k12/k12ebey0bu?_gl=1*1cuxjhu*_ga*MTY2MTgzNzQzMS4xNzU5NTg3MjM4*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*czE3NTk2OTYxNTkkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTk2OTkzMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw\">up to 300 billion Euros</a> (about US$350 billion) to support the global clean energy transition in developing countries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The United Kingdom, Japan and Australia</strong> submitted their most ambitious targets to date. All three put them on track to reach <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-new-york-climate-summit-climate-watch-flags-huge-emissions-gap-101758709221135.html\">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, meaning any greenhouse gases they emit will be offset by projects that avoid carbon emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>In Australia, Queensland’s recent announcement that it would <a href=\"https://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/policies-and-programs/energy/energy-roadmap/\">extend existing coal power plant use</a> to the 2030s and 2040s may slow national progress. But Queensland also supports scaling up renewable energy and is still <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-10/queensland-government-to-establish-400m-energy-fund/105874318\">aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Norway</strong> committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker?search=norway\">at least 70% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels</a>, which would align with the Paris Agreement goal to keep global emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). However, it <a href=\"https://www.sodir.no/en/whats-new/publications/reports/resource-report/resource-report-2022/6--future-production-and-revenues/\">plans to remain</a> a major oil and gas exporter.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, many developing countries also stepped up their commitments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brazil</strong> <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/brazil/\">pledged a net emissions reduction of 59% to 67% by 2035</a> and is maintaining its 2050 net-zero target. The government also drew criticism for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2735yp75ko\">approving plans for oil exploration</a> near the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n\n<h2>Free riding and taking cover behind the US</h2>\n\n<p>However, while some new climate commitments signal important momentum in the fight against climate change, the tug-of-war between global ambition to slow climate change and strategic self-interests was palpable at the New York summit. The responses to Trump’s remarks revealed both veiled critiques and deceleration of climate action by some governments.</p>\n\n<p>China <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/24/china-doubles-down-on-climate-wind-and-solar-pledges-a-day-after-trump-called-them-a-scam-00579411\">criticized backsliding by some countries</a>, without naming names.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil used the summit to call out countries that were late in submitting their updated climate commitments. Only about a third had submitted their <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/NDCREG\">updated pledges</a> at that point.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lula da Silva stands in a group talking, including heads of the UN and EU.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will host the 30th annual U.N. climate conference, COP 30, in November 2025, talks with other world leaders at the U.N. in September 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/COP28ClimateSummit/0126ee9734ea46f7a7bf6afdbd60cd95/photo\">AP Photo/Peter Dejong</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While it is difficult to parse out individual country motivations – economic stress, wars and political influence can all play a role – many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1412934\">scholars worry</a> that <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BFI_WP_2023-146-1.pdf\">U.S. backsliding will lead</a> other countries to reduce their climate commitments, and some recent pledges appear to back this up.</p>\n\n<p>Many petroleum-producing countries missed the U.N. pledge deadline.

The new format would also allow city and state actions to be counted separately, increasing incentives for them to act.</p>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en\">host of the COP30 climate talks</a> Nov. 10-21, 2025, Brazil is uniquely positioned to champion this concept. In the absence of U.S. leadership, the proposal could offer a rare opportunity for countries to collectively strengthen commitments and reshape treaty language in a way never seen before – leaving open the possibility for progress.</p>\n\n<p><em>Wila Mannella, a research assistant and graduate student in environmental studies at USC, contributed to this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267194/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Gibson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

While these long-term risks are important, a less frequently discussed concern is motion sickness.</p>\n\n<p>As a child, one of us (Taylor) was highly prone to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-causes-motion-sickness-heres-how-to-reconcile-the-mismatch-in-what-your-senses-are-telling-your-brain-194802\">motion sickness</a> – whether in the backseat of a car, sitting on a train or riding a bus. At the time, she considered it a cruel twist of fate, but as an adult – <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jY9zD-oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and a scientist to boot</a> – Taylor can tell you with confidence that it was entirely her fault.</p>\n\n<p>You see, like most children during long car rides, Taylor would get bored. So, to combat this boredom, she would either read a book or play on her Gameboy. She would stare down at whatever form of entertainment was in her lap that day until the familiar creeping sensation of nausea developed.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, looking out the side window would help, but more often than not, Taylor’s dad would have to pull over at the next gas station for a short break, or else they’d all suffer the consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Now, she understands what was happening on a more fundamental level. As children, you are taught about the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. However, there is a hidden sixth sense that helps your body understand how you are moving – <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/vestibular-system\">the vestibular system</a>. The brain takes information from all these senses and compares it to what it might expect when moving, based on past experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Optimally, any disagreement between your vestibular senses and your brain’s expectations would be small. But when there are large, sustained conflicts, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1139/y90-044\">you get sick</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While reading in the car, Taylor was staring at nonmoving words on a page while her vestibular system told her brain she was traveling down a road. This discrepancy confused her brain since usually, when Taylor felt movement, she should see the world shifting around her in the same way – hence her motion sickness. Had she been looking out the window and watching the world pass by, she would have been fine. Even better, had she been in the front seat, she would have been able to see the road ahead and predict how she would move in the future.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The view from the driver's seat of a car, showing the top of a steering wheel, the windshield view and the rearview mirror.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Looking out the front window while driving can help mitigate motion sickness by aligning your vestigial senses with how your brain expects to be moving.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/close-up-of-side-view-mirror-seen-through-car-royalty-free-image/2168528390?phrase=windshield\">EyeEm Mobile GmbH/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The sensory conflict between what you experience and what your brain expects doesn’t cause only carsickness.

Over half of all astronauts experience some symptoms of space motion sickness when they first get to space, and terrestrial readaptation motion sickness <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9889-0_14\">occurs at a similar incidence rate</a> when they come back down. </p>\n\n<h2>Dangers to astronauts</h2>\n\n<p>If you have ever experienced motion sickness, you know how hard it is to do anything other than close your eyes and take deep breaths to expel the creeping urge to vomit. As a passenger in a car, that may be OK, since you aren’t expected to jump into action at a moment’s notice. But while isolated on the water in a return capsule, astronauts need to remain focused and clearheaded. In case of an emergency, they’ll need to respond rapidly. </p>\n\n<p>If the astronauts need to get out of the capsule prior to pickup up by the recovery team, any motion sickness they have could delay their response time and impede evacuation attempts. </p>\n\n<h2>Potential solutions</h2>\n\n<p>Presently, most astronauts rely <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html\">on medication</a> that interrupts the brain’s ability to use <a href=\"https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bcp.70056\">hormones to trigger motion sickness</a>. However, as with many commercial products, these drugs can cause side effects such as drowsiness and can lose efficacy over time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-025-00478-9\">Our research team completed two experiments</a> to investigate how we might be able to manipulate visual information to mitigate motion sickness in astronauts, without relying on pharmaceuticals.</p>\n\n<p>Our participants were exposed to motions meant to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/VES-2007-175-612\">simulate transitions between gravity environments</a> and then <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-023-06715-5\">ocean wavelike motion</a>. During the hour of wavelike motion, we investigated whether a “virtual window” could reduce the incidence of motion sickness. </p>\n\n<p>When in a capsule on the ocean, astronauts are strapped into their seats and likely cannot see out of the small windows built into the capsule. In place of windows, we used virtual reality headsets to create a full-view virtual window.</p>\n\n<p>In our control group, the subjects received no visual cues of motion – akin to Taylor’s poorly advised backseat reading. Meanwhile, one countermeasure group got to see a visual scene that moved naturally with their motion, like looking out the side window of the car at the surrounding world. The other countermeasure group saw a scene that moved appropriately and was provided an overlay showing future motion, like looking out the front window and seeing the road ahead.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3Aijwo_diU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The device moving in a wavelike motion.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As expected, the group with no cues of motion got the sickest. Two-thirds of the subjects needed to stop prior to finishing an hour of wavelike motion, due to excessive nausea. Only about one-fifth of the group that was given the side window view needed to stop early. Only one-tenth of the front window group that received present and future visual cues dropped out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-025-00478-9\">These results</a> mean that by tracking the capsule motion and projecting it on a headset for the astronauts inside, our team may be able to reduce debilitating motion sickness by roughly half. If we could figure out how to predict how the capsule would move, we could give them that front window experience and improve the landing even more. In case of emergency, they could always take off the headsets.</p>\n\n<p>This work shows promise for motion sickness interventions that do not rely on pharmaceuticals, which are currently used to combat these effects. Our solutions don’t have the same concerns around shelf life, stability or side effects. In addition to the benefits for astronauts, such approaches could help those prone to motion sickness here on Earth, particularly in scenarios where looking out the front window at the road isn’t feasible, such as on planes, trains, buses or high-speed transportation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263706/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Human Research Program under Grant No. 80NSSC21K0257.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Torin Clark receives funding from NASA, the Office of Naval Research and the National Institutes for Health, and he receives fellowships from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

For most social scientists and policymakers who have long declared polygamy a “<a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/general-comments-and-recommendations/joint-general-recommendation-no-31-committee\">harmful cultural practice</a>,” the decision was a frustrating but predictable setback in efforts to build healthier and more equal societies.</p>\n\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, polygamy takes the form of one husband and multiple wives – more precisely referred to as polygyny, originating from the Greek words “poly” (“many”) and “gynē” (“woman or wife”). The opposite arrangement of one wife and multiple husbands is referred to as polyandry (from “anēr” meaning “man” or “husband”) and is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/12/07/polygamy-is-rare-around-the-world-and-mostly-confined-to-a-few-regions/\">exceedingly rare worldwide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Critics of polygyny present two main arguments. First, they contend it squeezes low-status men out of the marriage market, fostering social unrest, crime and violence against women by frustrated unwed men. Second, it harms women and children by dividing limited resources among more dependents.</p>\n\n<p>This logic has led leading political scientist Rose McDermott <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501718045/the-evils-of-polygyny\">to describe polygyny as evil</a>.

The project is a collaboration between demographer <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s3PC39wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Hampton Gaddy</a> and evolutionary anthropologists <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HBjME2gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Rebecca Sear</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-laura-fortunato\">Laura Fortunato</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers drew on demographic modeling and an extraordinary trove of census data – over 84 million records from 30 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceania, plus the entire U.S. census from 1880, when polygyny was practiced in some American communities. They demonstrate that polygyny does not lock large numbers of men out of marriage. In fact, in many contexts, men are actually more likely to marry where polygyny is common than where it is rare.</p>\n\n<p>The narrative that polygyny leads to lonely bachelors is intuitive. In a community with equal numbers of men and women, if one man marries two wives, then another man must remain unmarried. Expand that across a whole society, and polygyny looks like a recipe for an army of resentful, single men.</p>\n\n<p>Parallel arguments have been made about the rise of incel – a portmanteau of “involuntary” and “celibate” – subcultures within monogamous nations, including the U.S. Here, the argument is that high-status men leave low-status men sexless and frustrated, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-06236-6\">ultimately leading to violence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble is that real demography is not so simple. Women typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1701535115\">live longer than men</a>, men frequently <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.002\">marry younger women</a>, and populations in many parts of the world <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.160\">are growing</a>, ensuring younger spouses are available for older cohorts. These factors, which are characteristic of many contemporary African nations, tilt the marriage market toward a surplus of women. Under many realistic conditions, a sizable proportion of men can have multiple wives without leaving their peers out in the cold.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in nearly half of the countries examined, higher rates of polygyny were associated with fewer, not more, unmarried men. Only a handful of countries showed the expected positive relationship, and even then inconsistently over time.</p>\n\n<p>The case of historical Mormon communities in North America is equally revealing. When the researchers compared counties with documented Mormon polygyny to others in the 1880 census, they found lower rates of unmarried men in polygynous areas. Gaddy and his colleagues contend that this is explained by the tendency for cultural norms that favor polygyny to also be relatively pronatalist, driving marriage rates upward for all.</p>\n\n<h2>Do women and children get a smaller share?</h2>\n\n<p>What about the argument that polygyny harms women and children by dividing male-owned wealth among more mouths to feed? There certainly are studies that have demonstrated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1100306108\">associations between polygyny and poor health</a>. But another line of thinking argues that correlation should not be equated with causation. </p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago, my colleages and I documented that polygyny is associated with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1507151112\">higher food insecurity and poor child health</a> when comparing outcomes across over 50 Tanzanian villages. However, this pattern was an artifact of polygyny being most common in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110447\">marginalized Maasai communities</a>, which tend to live in drought-prone areas with inadequate health care. Moreover, when comparing families within communities, polygynous households were typically wealthier, a key factor in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00164897\">making polygyny attractive to women</a>, and children were not disadvantaged.</p>\n\n<p>Echoing these results, anthropologist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6mj6WIIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Riana Minocher</a> and her colleagues recently published a study that uses a detailed, longitudinal dataset from a 20-year prospective study in another region of Tanzania. Analyzing survival, growth and education for thousands of children, they found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2407785121\">no evidence that monogamous marriage is advantageous</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Together, these results support a theory known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00164897\">polygyny threshold model</a>. Simply put, provided women have choice in marriage, sharing a husband is unlikely to be economically detrimental, since they will prioritize marrying men with sufficient wealth to offset any cost. This scenario may not fit all contexts, but these studies clearly undercut claims that polygyny is unequivocally harmful.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"89Opa\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/89Opa/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Hidden advantages of polygyny</h2>\n\n<p>Another recent study, published in August 2025 by economist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ImGKy8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Sylvain Dessy</a> and his colleagues, goes further, suggesting that polygyny <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhaf020\">has unrecognized advantages</a> when times are tough. </p>\n\n<p>Drawing on crop yield data from over 4,000 farm households across Mali, census data on marriage patterns and detailed meteorological records, they found that in villages where polygyny is rare, droughts cut harvests dramatically. But in villages where polygyny is common, that blow is softened.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers argue that polygynous marriage, by increasing the number of in-laws, creates stronger networks of social support. Furthermore, with wives often coming from different villages and regions, extended kin are well positioned to send food, money or labor when local crops fail. Such support helps to explain both the resilience of polygynous communities during drought and the continued endurance of the marriage practice from one generation to the next.</p>\n\n<h2>So, is polygyny harmless?</h2>\n\n<p>These studies don’t mean that polygyny is harmless. Indeed, allowing men but not women to have multiple spouses is clearly unequal and entwined with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02734133\">patriarchal ideology</a> that positions women as subordinate or inferior to men. Recent studies, for example, have suggested that polygynous marriages are more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-22581-y\">prone to intimate partner violence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In short, there remain multiple ways polygyny can be harmful.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the best evidence suggests that polygyny is unlikely to be a root cause of social unrest. Moreover, within wider patriarchal systems that afford few women, regardless of marital status, economic and social security, polygyny may not just be a tolerable choice but in some contexts a preferred arrangement with tangible benefits for both genders. </p>\n\n<p>Simplistic stories about the dangers of polygyny can be compelling and intuitive, but they risk misleading the public, reinforcing stubborn notions of Western cultural superiority and disrupting effective global health policy by sidelining more pertinent initiatives. Building healthier societies necessitates paying attention to the evidence and remaining open to the possibility that all family structures have capacity to cause harm.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267201/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David W.

However, over the past five years among the U.S. airlines, the <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-02-26-01/\">risk of dying was almost zero</a>. In fact, you have a much better chance of winning most lotteries than you do of dying as a passenger on a U.S. air carrier. </p>\n\n<p>How did flying get so safe? And can we apply the hard-earned safety lessons from aviation to artificial intelligence?</p>\n\n<p>When humanity introduces a new paradigm-shifting technology and that technology is rapidly adopted globally, the future consequences are unknown and often collectively feared. The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/history/120-years-ago-the-first-powered-flight-at-kitty-hawk/\">introduction of powered flight</a> in 1903 by the Wright brothers was no exception. There were many objections to this new technology, including religious, political and <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4065/4065-h/4065-h.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com#chap21\">technical</a> concerns.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t long after powered flight was introduced that the first airplane accident occurred – and by not long I mean the same day. It happened on <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/history/120-years-ago-the-first-powered-flight-at-kitty-hawk/\">the Wright brothers’ fourth flight</a>. The first person to die in an aircraft accident <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/object/1909-wright-military-flyer%3Anasm_A19120001000\">was killed five years later in 1908</a>. Since then, there have been over 89,000 airplane accidents globally. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a researcher who <a href=\"https://campus.und.edu/directory/james.higgins\">studies air travel safety</a>, and I see how today’s AI industry resembles the early – and decidedly less safe – years of the aviation industry.</p>\n\n<h2>From studying accidents to predicting them</h2>\n\n<p>Although tragic, each accident and each fatality represented a moment for reflection and learning. Accident investigators attempted to recreate every accident and identify accident precursors and root causes. Once investigators identified what led up to each crash, aircraft makers and operators put safety measures into effect in hopes of preventing additional accidents. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if a pilot in the earlier era of flight forgot to lower the landing gear prior to landing, a landing accident was the likely result. So the industry figured out to install warning systems that would alert pilots about the unsafe state of the landing gear – a lesson learned only after accidents. This reactive process, while necessary, is a heavy price to pay to learn how to improve safety.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the 20th century, the aviation world <a href=\"https://www2023.icao.int/about-icao/History/Pages/Milestones-in-International-Civil-Aviation.aspx\">organized and standardized its operations, procedures and processes</a>. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Civil Aeronautics Act, which <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/about/history/brief_history\">established the Civil Aeronautics Authority</a>. This precursor to the Federal Aviation Administration included an Air Safety Board. </p>\n\n<p>The fully reactive safety paradigm shifted over time to proactive and eventually predictive. In 1997, a group of industry, labor and government aviation organizations formed a group called the <a href=\"https://www.cast-safety.org/\">Commercial Aviation Safety Team</a>. They started to look at the data and attempted to find trends and analyze user reports to identify risks and hazards before they became full-blown accidents. </p>\n\n<p>The group, which includes the FAA and NASA, decided early on that there would be no competition among airlines when it came to safety. The industry would openly share safety data. When was the last time you saw an airline advertising campaign claiming “our airline is safer than theirs”?</p>\n\n<h2>It’s down to data</h2>\n\n<p>The Commercial Aviation Safety Team helped the industry transition from reactive to predictive by adopting a data-driven, systemic approach to tackling safety issues. It generated this data using reports from people and data from aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Every day, millions of flights occur worldwide, and on every single one of those flights, thousands of data points are recorded. Aviation safety professionals now use <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/Pages/cvr_fdr.aspx\">Flight Data Recorders</a> – long used to investigate accidents after the fact – to analyze data from every flight. By closely examining all this data, safety analysts can <a href=\"https://nbaa.org/aircraft-operations/safety/safety-data-collection-analysis-and-sharing/flight-data-monitoring-fdm/\">spot emerging and troublesome events and trends</a>. For example, by analyzing the data, a trained safety scientist can spot if certain aircraft approaches to runways are becoming riskier due to factors like excessive airspeed and poor alignment – before a landing accident occurs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two orange metal containers, one a horizontal cylinder and the other a rectangular box\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Flight voice and data recorders are well known from accident investigations, but the data from ordinary flights is invaluable for preventing accidents.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flightrecorders.JPG\">YSSYguy/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To further increase proactive and predictive capabilities, anyone who operates within the aviation system can submit <a href=\"https://www.natca.org/foundations-of-professionalism/atsap/\">anonymous and nonpunitive safety reports</a>.

The risk of dying as a passenger onboard a U.S. airline is now <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/how-much-training-should-an-airline-pilot-need-db974a91\">less than 1 in 98 million</a>. You are more likely to die <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/is-flying-safer-than-driving/\">on your drive to the airport</a> than in an aircraft accident. Now, more than 100 years since the advent of powered flight, the aviation industry – after learning hard lessons – has become extremely safe. </p>\n\n<h2>A model for AI</h2>\n\n<p>AI is rapidly permeating many facets of life, from self-driving cars to criminal justice actions and hiring and loan decisions. The technology is far from foolproof, however, and errors attributable to AI have had life-altering – and in some cases even <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-teslas-autopilot-crashes-spurred-the-feds-to-investigate-driver-assist-technologies-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-166307\">life-and-death</a> – consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all AI companies are trying to implement some <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework\">safety measures</a>. But they appear to be making these efforts individually, just like the early players in the aviation field did. And these efforts are largely reactive, waiting for AI to make a mistake and then acting. </p>\n\n<p>What if there was a group like the Commercial Aviation Safety Team where all AI companies, regulators, academia and other interested parties convened to start the proactive and predictive processes of ensuring AI doesn’t lead to calamities?</p>\n\n<p>From a reporting perspective, imagine if every AI interface had a report button that a user could click to not only report potentially hallucinated and unsafe results to each company, but also report the same to an AI organization modeled on the Commercial Aviation Safety Team. In addition, data generated by AI systems, much like we see in aviation, could also be collected, aggregated and analyzed for safety threats.  </p>\n\n<p>Although this approach may not be the ultimate solution to preventing harm from AI, if Big Tech adopts lessons learned from other <a href=\"https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/high-reliability\">high-consequence industries</a> like aviation, it just might learn to regulate, control and, yes, make AI safer for all to use.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265960/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James Higgins receives funding from the FAA to conduct research regarding flight safety topics.

Streetlamps were ignited, and storefront windows blazed with light.</p>\n\n<p>Residents called Nov. 28, 1939, “<a href=\"https://unrememberedhistory.com/2015/05/19/smog-city-the-day-st-louis-lost-the-sun/\">Black Tuesday</a>.” Day turned to night as thick, acrid clouds blackened the sky. Even at street level, visibility was just a few feet. The air pollution was caused by homes, businesses and factories, which burned soft, sulfur-rich coal for heat and power. The soft coal was cheap and burned easily but produced vast amounts of smoke.</p>\n\n<p>The murky morning was an extreme version of a problem <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/b20278548/page/n5/mode/2up\">St. Louis and dozens of other American cities</a> had been <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.reportofspecialc00sain_0/?st=gallery\">experiencing for decades</a>. Strict federal air pollution regulations were still 30 years away, and state and local efforts to limit coal smoke had failed miserably. </p>\n\n<p>Today, as the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinvigorates-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry/\">Trump administration</a> works to <a href=\"https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-trump-allowed-over-40-power-plants-to-delay-compliance-with-hazardous-air-pollution-limits/\">roll back air pollution limits on coal</a>, the events in St. Louis more than 80 years ago serve as a reminder of how bad a situation can become before people’s objections finally force the government to act. And as I discuss in my book “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/black-gold/\">Black Gold: The Rise, Reign and Fall of American Coal</a>,” those events also highlight how successful that action can be.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZX4gSDVvLQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The fight for cleaner air is a key part of St. Louis history.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A widespread civic effort</h2>\n\n<p>Days after Black Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/article_011f3bd2-92ea-11ee-8aff-b304fe125ba6.html\">St. Louis Mayor Bernard Dickmann</a> responded to the crisis by creating a commission to investigate and recommend a solution to the continuing air pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Just before Black Tuesday, Joseph Pulitzer II, publisher of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, had launched his own <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/cms/sites/default/files/content/the_pulitzer_prizes_2021_winners_and_finalists.pdf\">anti-smoke newspaper campaign</a> seeking fundamental change. In my research I found the first editorial, on Nov. 13, 1939, which declared “something must be done, or else.” A crack reporter, Sam J. Shelton, was assigned full time to what became the smoke beat. Post-Dispatch news stories, editorials and political cartoons championed the values of cleaner air and the dangers of toxic pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Dickmann’s <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6762905/missouri-fresh-air/\">Smoke Elimination Committee</a> met 13 times over a winter that seemed unrelenting in darkness. News and weather reports record that smoke blotted out the Sun on one out of every three days, and sometimes sunlight never pierced the darkness. Advice poured in, including from a Hollywood-style stuntman and flagpole sitter, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1952/10/12/archives/shipwreck-kelly-dies-on-sidewalk-flagpole-sitter-and-stunt-man-of.html\">Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly</a>, who offered to perch in the sky searching for dirty chimneys.</p>\n\n<p>In late February 1940, the commission issued a report recommending restrictions on smoke emissions. The report said residents and industry should either pay more to buy coal with less sulfur or other fuel, or pay for and install new equipment to burn the sulfur-rich coal more cleanly. On April 5, the city’s Board of Aldermen convened to consider the changes in law that would enact the recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Newspapers reported that more than 300 protesters, including coal dealers, operators and miners, parked their trucks outside City Hall, waving banners. Black smoke spewed upward from coal stoves mounted atop one, newspaper reports said. The boisterous throng marched into City Hall, shouting and often drowning out city representatives. Amid catcalls and boos, the aldermen passed the ordinance 28-1.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zC0vzV0JHcE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">St. Louis did a lot of work to control air pollution from burning coal.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Immediately, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/25/archives/raymond-tucker-st-louis-mayor-195365-executive-is-dead-led-civic.html\">Raymond Tucker</a>, the mayor’s deputy, began arranging for suppliers of more expensive low-sulfur coal for the city’s residents and businesses. He launched a slick public relations campaign urging residents to comply with the new law.

Bootleg coal shipments arrived. More than once, Tucker’s armed inspectors <a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2015/11/20/smoke-inspectors-shoot-at-suspect-coal-bootleggers/\">fired at a suspect truck</a> that ignored orders to stop, according to newspaper reports from the time.</p>\n\n<p>While hopes were already high that the new, tough measures would clean the skies, the winter of 1940-41 <a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2016/01/15/the-weather-bureau-confirms-what-has-now-become-obvious-in-st-louis/\">defied even those rosy expectations</a>. By mid-January, the city’s skies were so <a href=\"https://dnr.mo.gov/air/hows-air/missouri-skies-now-then\">much cleaner than the year before</a> that they were the talk of the town. They were clear blue, and even on days when there was smoke, it was <a href=\"https://dnr.mo.gov/air/hows-air/missouri-skies-now-then\">far less than had been common</a> before the city ordinance passed.</p>\n\n<p>The national press picked up the news, and arriving visitors wrote letters to the editors of their hometown newspapers reporting being astounded by what St. Louis had accomplished that winter. Tucker compiled notes on how many <a href=\"https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt:SCLS030\">communities in the U.S.</a> and Canada sought details on the transformation. In that document, now held among his archives at Washington University in St. Louis, he listed 83.</p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2016/02/04/st-louis-declares-victory-in-air/\">A great city has washed its face</a>,” Sam Shelton wrote for the Post-Dispatch. “St. Louis is no longer the grimy old man of American municipalities.” The “plague of smoke and soot” had been wiped away after a century in “a dramatic story of intelligent, courageous and co-operative effort.” No longer did residents have to endure “burning throats, hacking coughs, smarting eyes, sooty faces and soiled clothing.” </p>\n\n<p>The newspaper was awarded a <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/st-louis-post-dispatch-0\">Pulitzer Prize for public service</a> in 1941 for its campaign, the first time that a major award was conferred for an environmental story. </p>\n\n<p>For years afterward, the coal industry argued that the St. Louis campaign was a fraud that needlessly forced residents to buy more expensive fuel and equipment. But even during World War II, when industrial restrictions meant pollution was worse in the name of driving the war economy, the city’s skies were never as blackened as they had been before.</p>\n\n<p>Tucker, the mayor’s deputy, later used the fame he had achieved from the smoke campaign as a springboard to being elected mayor. He served 12 years. His former boss, Dickmann, was less fortunate, losing his reelection bid in 1941. <a href=\"https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999535365102121/cite\">He blamed it on</a> having forced residents to pay more, even though it meant cleaner fuel for their homes and clearer skies for their community.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265934/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Wyss does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The opening of the Erie Canal reached beyond Clinton’s Empire State, cementing the Midwest into the prosperity of the growing nation. This human-made waterway transformed America’s economy and <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/news/erie-canal-immigration-wisconsin-laurie-lawlor\">immigration</a> while helping fuel <a href=\"https://nyheritage.org/exhibits/two-hundred-years-erie-canal/burned-over-district\">a passionate religious revival</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But like most big achievements, getting there wasn’t easy. The nation’s first “superhighway” was almost dead on arrival. </p>\n\n<h2>Clinton’s folly</h2>\n\n<p>The idea of connecting New York City to the Great Lakes <a href=\"https://www.albanyinstitute.org/online-exhibition/50-objects/section/erie-canal-2\">originated in the late 18th century</a>. Yet when Clinton pushed to build a canal, the plan was controversial. </p>\n\n<p>The governor and his supporters secured funding through Congress in 1817, but President James Madison vetoed the bill, considering federal support for a state project unconstitutional. New York turned to state bonds to finance the project, which Madison’s ally Thomas Jefferson had <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">derided as “madness</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Some considered “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Water_in_North_American_Environmental_Hi/Tjb-EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=clinton%27s+big+ditch&amp;pg=PA113&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Clinton’s big ditch</a>” blasphemy. “If the Lord had intended there should be internal waterways,” <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813049540\">argued Quaker minister Elias Hicks</a>, “he would have placed them there.” </p>\n\n<p>Construction <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/october/opening-erie-canal\">began on July 4, 1817</a>. Completed eight years later, the canal stretched some 363 miles (584 kilometers), with <a href=\"https://eriecanalway.org/learn/history-culture/fast-facts\">18 aqueducts and 83 locks</a> to compensate for elevation changes en route. All this was built with only basic tools, pack animals and human muscle – the latter supplied by some 9,000 laborers, roughly <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">one-quarter of whom</a> were recent immigrants from Ireland.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A faded chart shows the names of cities, in order from west to east, along with their relative elevation.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An 1832 lithograph by David H.

The hefty $7 million investment in building the Erie Canal had been <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">fully recouped</a> in toll fees alone. </p>\n\n<h2>Religious revival</h2>\n\n<p>Nor was its legacy simply economic. Like many Americans during the Industrial Revolution, New Yorkers struggled to find stability, purpose and community. The Erie Canal channeled new ideas and religious movements, including <a href=\"https://www.thearda.com/us-religion/history/timelines/entry?etype=1&amp;eid=326\">the Second Great Awakening</a>: a nationwide movement of Christian evangelism and social reform, partly in reaction to the upheavals of a changing economy. </p>\n\n<p>Though the movement began at the turn of the century, it flourished in the hinterlands along the Erie Canal, which became known as <a href=\"https://nyheritage.org/exhibits/two-hundred-years-erie-canal/burned-over-district\">the “Burned-Over District</a>.” Revivalists like <a href=\"https://www.thearda.com/us-religion/history/timelines/entry?etype=1&amp;eid=246\">Charles Grandison Finney</a> – America’s most famous preacher at the time – found a lively reception along this “<a href=\"https://press.syr.edu/supressbooks/1604/listen-for-lonesome-drum/\">psychic highway</a>,” as one author later dubbed upstate New York.</p>\n\n<p>Some denominations, <a href=\"https://exploregeneseevalley.com/entries/burned-over-how-methodism-and-the-second-great-awakening-shaped-the-genesee-valley/5d9d8891-69cb-4b5a-8e76-1a8fa42a5cb0\">like the Methodists</a>, grew dramatically. But the “Burned-Over District” also gave birth to new churches after the canal’s creation. Joseph Smith <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints\">founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, often known as Mormons, in Fayette, New York, in 1830. The teachings of <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/amprophesy.html\">William Miller</a>, who lived near the Vermont border, spread west along the canal route – the roots of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A faded black-and-white illustration of a small crowd in front of a speaker's stand in a clearing amid trees.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A camp revival meeting of the Methodists , circa 1829.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/camp-meeting-of-the-methodists-in-north-america-c-1829-news-photo/959938322?adppopup=true\">Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Door to the West</h2>\n\n<p>As Clinton predicted, the Erie Canal was “<a href=\"https://history.nycourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/finch_history.pdf\">a bond of union</a> between the Atlantic and Western States,” uniting upstate New York and the agrarian frontier of the Midwest to the urban markets of the Eastern seaboard. </p>\n\n<p>In the mid-1820s, Ohio Gov. Ethan Allen Brown <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ohio_State_Archaeological_and_Historical/N_wKAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22veins+and+arteries+to+the+body+politic%22&amp;pg=PA141&amp;printsec=frontcover\">praised America’s canals</a> “as veins and arteries to the body politic” and commissioned <a href=\"https://chpl.org/blogs/post/throwback-thursday-take-a-trip-on-the-miami-and-erie-canal/\">two canals of his own</a>: one to link the Ohio River to the Erie Canal, completed in 1832; and another to link the Miami River, completed in 1845. These canals in turn connected to numerous smaller waterways, creating an extensive network of trade and transportation.</p>\n\n<p>Like New York, Ohio had its canal towns, <a href=\"https://www.middletownhistoricalsociety.com/canalbicentennial\">including Middletown</a>: the birthplace of Vice President JD Vance and a city emblematic of America’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/revisiting-middletown-ohio-the-midwestern-town-at-the-heart-of-jd-vances-hillbilly-elegy-234975\">shifting industrial fortunes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While America’s canal boom brought prosperity, this wealth <a href=\"https://eriecanalway.org/learn/history-culture/native-americans\">came at a cost to many Indigenous communities</a> – a cost that is only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/nyregion/erie-canal-bicentennial.html?searchResultPosition=1\">slowly being acknowledged</a>. The Haudenosaunee, often known by the name “Iroquois,” especially paid the price for the Erie Canal. The confederacy of tribes was pressured into ceding lands to the state of New York, and further displaced by ensuing frontier settlement.</p>\n\n<h2>Past and future</h2>\n\n<p>As the U.S. nears its 250th birthday on July 4, 2026, the <a href=\"https://america250.org/\">official website</a> of this commemoration urges Americans “to pause and reflect on our nation’s past … and look ahead toward the future we want to create for the next generation and beyond.”</p>\n\n<p>As the recent <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-quick-compromise-to-the-first-government-shutdown-in-nearly-7-years-seems-unlikely-266450\">federal government shutdown</a> suggests, however, the nation’s political system is struggling. </p>\n\n<p>Overcoming gridlock demands bipartisan consensus on basic concerns. Technology changes, but the demands of infrastructure – from <a href=\"https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/03/infrastructures-upward-momentum-reflected-in-report-card\">rebuilding roads and bridges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/closing-digital-divide-millions-americans-without-broadband\">expanding broadband</a> and sustainable energy networks – and the will needed to address them, persist.

These environments are generally hostile to human and equipment health, so designing and executing these missions requires a lot of planning, testing and technological development. </p>\n\n<p>You may have heard about the extensive <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/setmo/facilities/\">testing facilities for spacecraft and equipment</a>, but how do scientists prepare for the human aspect of space exploration? </p>\n\n<p>One way to test out techniques and identify situations that may arise during a real mission is using a simulation, which in this field is more commonly <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/analog-missions/\">known as an analog</a>. Researchers choose and design analog missions and environments to replicate elements of a real mission, using what is available here on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>These missions are conducted in extreme environments on Earth that are comparable to the Moon or Mars, in habitats designed to replicate living quarters, or a combination of both. Researchers can use analogs to study crew performance and procedures, or to test instruments <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM7OdOiElbk\">under development for use in space</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, operating a drill or wrench may seem easy here on Earth, but try doing the same task in thick gloves on a bulky, pressurized space suit in lower gravity. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasa-innovative-tools-for-an-out-of-this-world-job/\">Suddenly, things aren’t so straightforward</a>. Testing these scenarios on Earth allows researchers to identify necessary changes before launch. The analogs can also train crew members who will one day undertake the actual mission. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a planetary scientist, which means I study the geology of other planets. Currently, I study environments on Earth that are similar to other planets to improve our understanding of their counterparts elsewhere in the solar system. I participated as a volunteer in one of these analog missions as an “analog astronaut,” serving as the crew geologist and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ww-fObYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">applying my prior research findings</a> from studying the <a href=\"https://npp.orau.org/experiences/jordan-bretzfelder.html\">surfaces of the Moon and Mars</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These analog missions vary in setting, length and intensity, but all aim to learn more about the human factors involved in space exploration. </p>\n\n<h2>Where do we send them?</h2>\n\n<p>Analog missions are designed to simulate the crew’s experience in a given mission plan. In some cases, they simulate surface operations on the Moon or Mars for up to a year. Others might replicate the experience of being in transit to Mars for a period of time, followed by the crew “landing” and exploring the surface.</p>\n\n<p>NASA uses several analog mission facilities spread across the world. For example, the <a href=\"https://mars-desert-research-station.raisely.com/MDRS\">Mars Desert Research Station</a> in Utah is located in an environment chosen to imitate conditions on Mars, while <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/neemo/about-neemo-nasa-extreme-environment-mission-operations/\">analog missions at Aquarius</a>, an undersea research station off the coast of Florida, help scientists learn about crew behavior and psychology in a confined habitat located in a hostile environment.</p>\n\n<p>Some natural environments are commonly used for analog operations, such as <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasa-field-geology-training-prepares-artemis-mission-support-teams/\">volcanic terrains</a> in the western U.S., <a href=\"https://st.llnl.gov/news/look-back/apollo-astronauts-train-nevada-test-site\">human-made craters in Nevada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZwa5kEaNTY\">natural meteor crater in Arizona</a> <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/antarctic-stations/\">and research stations in Antarctica</a>. These locations mirror the geologic settings the crews are likely to encounter on future missions, and so training in these locations helps them execute the actual missions. </p>\n\n<p>I participated in a simulated 28-day lunar surface mission at a facility called <a href=\"https://www.hi-seas.org\">Hi-SEAS</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.sift.net/research/computational-social-science/medulla\">a study on crew dynamics and psychology</a> in extreme isolation. The facility is located on Mauna Loa, a volcano on the big island of Hawaii. This habitat has been used for a variety of studies, as the volcanic terrain is reminiscent of both the Moon and parts of Mars, and the isolated location simulates being in space. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A series of photos showing a dome-shaped habitat; a circular window; a circular doorway labeled 'airlock'; a room full of cabinets and appliances labeled 'laboratory'; a stairwell and elliptical; and a room with a small bed labeled 'cabins'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The HI-SEAS Habitat, which recreates the conditions of living and working on the Moon, is located in Mauna Loa, Hawaii.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jordan Bretzfelder</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Analog mission crews</h2>\n\n<p>Most missions require applicants to hold relevant degrees.

We practiced emergency procedures and were taught how to perform other tasks. </p>\n\n<p>After that orientation, we were deployed to the habitat for 28 days. We turned in our phones to mission control and could only access the internet to check emails or use a few preapproved websites required for our daily duties.

They included individual assessments – similar to a daily IQ test – and group computer-based tasks, <a href=\"https://www.sift.net/demos/medulla-cubecrusher\">such as team 3D Tetris</a>. The researchers remotely monitored our interactions during these activities, and the results were analyzed as the mission progressed. They used our fluctuating performance on these activities as a proxy for estimating stress levels, group cohesion and individual well-being. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we went on two-to-three-hour extra-vehicular activities, or excursions outside the habitat, on alternating days. During these expeditions, we conducted geologic investigations on the volcano. On our “off days,” we spent two hours exercising in the habitat. We had to be fully suited in a mock spacesuit any time we went outside, and we had to be careful about the airlock procedures. We were never outdoors alone. </p>\n\n<p>We could only eat freeze-dried and powdered foods, aside from what we were able to grow in the hydroponic system. We had no additional food delivered during our stay. Water was also rationed, meaning we had to find innovative ways to maintain personal hygiene. For example, a bucket shower one or two times per week was allowed, supplemented by “wilderness wipe” baths. As someone with a lot of very curly hair, I was happy to figure out a method for managing it using less than two liters of water per week. We were also permitted to do laundry once during our stay, as a group. Sorting through your crewmates’ wet clothes was certainly one way to bond.</p>\n\n<p>Though physically demanding at times, the workload was not unreasonable. We were kept busy all day, as certain everyday tasks, such as cooking, required more effort than they might need in our normal lives. Preparing nutritionally balanced and palatable meals while rationing our very limited resources was hard, but it also provided opportunities to get creative with recipes and ingredients. We even managed to bake a cake for a crew member’s birthday, using peanut butter protein and cocoa powders to flavor it. </p>\n\n<p>After dinner each night, we shared the pre-saved movies and shows we had each brought with us into the habitat, as we could not access the internet. Those of us who had brought physical copies of books into the habitat would trade those as well. One crew member managed to acquire a downloadable form of <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/wordle-word-game-what-is-it-explained\">the daily Wordle</a>, so we could still compete with our friends back home. We also played board games, and all of these activities helped us get to know each other.</p>\n\n<p>Though different from our typical daily lives, the experience was one of a kind. We had the satisfaction of knowing that our efforts advanced space exploration in its own small way, one IQ test and slapdash cake at a time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264658/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jordan Bretzfelder does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Feet and toes aren’t pointy, most of men’s shoes aren’t pointy, and they hurt my feet.” – Bunny, age 13, Mizpah, New Jersey</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While people’s actual feet are rounded on the end, women’s dress shoes often come to a sharp point at the toe. Many people also feel these pointy shoes are <a href=\"https://www.pointelles.com/blogs/think-you-can-t-wear-pointed-toe-shoes-why-you-might-reconsider-this-stylish-shoe-option/how-should-pointed-toe-shoes-fit\">uncomfortable to wear</a>.

Called <a href=\"https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/poulaine/\">poulaines – or cracows</a>, after the Polish city Kraków, where historians think they originated – these shoes could run as long as 12 inches in length. To keep the stiff, pointy shape, the wearer would <a href=\"https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/pointy-shoes-sexuality-medieval-london/\">stuff the ends of the shoes</a> with moss or wool. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Black shoes with long, pointed tips\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The pointy tip is the point for poulaines.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://nat.museum-digital.de/object/25887\">Deutsches Schuhmuseum Hauenstein</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Like most items of fashion, shoes <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/medieval-europeans-pointy-shoes\">signal the wearer’s status</a> to their peers. Poulaines were heavily decorated and expensive to make, and their elongated design made it difficult to move around. Thus, wearing poulaines communicated to others that the wearer was wealthy, having no need to perform physical work that required mobility.</p>\n\n<h2>Pointy shoes as status symbol</h2>\n\n<p>These shoes became so popular that in 1463 King Edward IV of England passed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vnl1evdkko\">laws limiting toe length</a> to 2 inches for anyone below a lord in social ranking. This decree had social, political and religious effects.</p>\n\n<p>Socially, restricting the longest-toed shoes to the nobility ensured the shoe would be a visual status marker associated with the upper classes. This obvious sign helped maintain social order and prevented lower-class people from trying to pass themselves off as higher in standing than they were.</p>\n\n<p>Politically, the king used this same legislation to <a href=\"https://boydellandbrewer.com/book/medieval-dress-and-textiles-in-britain-9781843839323/\">control the textile trade and protect English industries</a>. By regulating the fabrics and accessories necessary to make excessively ornate shoes, Edward IV could limit foreign competition with English textile manufacturers and at the same time manage fashion trends.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Painting depicting various aristocrats wearing pointy shoes at a banquet\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Only nobility got to enjoy the longest pointy shoes England could offer.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Renaud_de_Montauban.jpg\">Loyset Liédet (circa 1470)/Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>From a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/dress-clothing/Government-regulation-of-dress\">religious perspective</a>, King Edward IV passed these laws on the grounds that God was displeased by anything other than modest clothing – for the lower classes, anyway. Additionally, religious leaders believed that the long toes prevented people from kneeling in a respectful, submissive manner and so restricted the <a href=\"https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/pointy-shoes-sexuality-medieval-london/\">ability to properly pray</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The pressure to literally “fit in” to these pointy shoes also came with a physical cost. Poulaines hurt the wearer’s feet and could make their toe bones crooked. Bunions – a bony bump that develops on the inside of the foot at the big toe – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fashion-for-pointy-shoes-unleashed-a-wave-of-bunions-in-medieval-england-162570\">became more common</a> with the popularity of these shoes.</p>\n\n<h2>Pain with a purpose</h2>\n\n<p>Various cultures have adopted pointy shoes throughout history, often to signify status, wealth or a connection to a specific subculture. A few examples include the <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-making-of-the-patiala-jutti-dastkari-haat-samiti/TAVx_OxWZxuiIg?hl=en\">juttis or khussas</a> of Northern India and Pakistan, respectively; the <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/every-step-a-lotus/paper\">lotus shoes</a> once popular in China; and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009151016.025\">pointed flat slippers</a> worn during the Etruscan civilization. </p>\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint, however, pointy-toed shoes can lead to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2021.04.012\">foot deformities</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.87.10.1677\">health problems</a>.

Like how early humans needed to stay with their tribe to survive, your brain thinks that being part of a group can help keep you safe.</p>\n\n<p>Because high-heeled, pointed shoes are commonly worn by women, wearing them gives the wearer feelings of acceptance from other women. While there is <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/beauty/the-bof-podcast-clothes-have-no-gender/\">nothing inherent</a> about pointy shoes that make them feminine or attractive – considering that they were often originally designed for men – fashion often relies on trends that people unconsciously agree on. What is stylish is often influenced by accepted social norms.</p>\n\n<p>Your brain also has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-use-mental-shortcuts-to-make-difficult-decisions-even-highly-trained-doctors-delivering-babies-168711\">clever shortcuts</a> to help you make decisions quickly. One shortcut is to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories-and-how-to-change-their-minds-82514\">look at what other people are doing</a>. If you see lots of people wearing a certain style or playing a particular game, your brain thinks, well, if everyone is doing this, it must be a good choice. This process helps you make decisions without having to think too hard about every little detail.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists call the powerful, mental influence fashion has on both the person wearing it and the people seeing their outfit <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.008\">enclothed cognition</a>. The shoes you wear may alter how you perceive yourself and others, as well as carry symbolic meaning. So designers might use elongated shoes to create the illusion of a long, slender silhouette to create a look that is not only seen but also personally felt as elegant and powerful.</p>\n\n<p>With new technology and an increased <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/footwear-purchasing-criteria#\">consumer desire for comfort</a>, the good news is that next time you get dressed and want to wear pointy, fashionable shoes, they may be at least a little less painful than they were in the past.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

The tales of ancient Egypt that emerged from Napoleon’s travels became a source of fascination to Americans, though in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>In the slaveholding South, ancient Egypt and its pharaohs became a way to justify slavery. For abolitionists and African Americans, biblical Egypt served as a symbol of bondage and liberation. </p>\n\n<p>As a historian, I study how 19th-century Americans – from Southern intellectuals to Black abolitionists – used ancient Egypt to debate questions of race, civilization and national identity. <a href=\"https://crulh.univ-lorraine.fr/membres/vanthournout-charles\">My research traces</a> how a distorted image of ancient Egypt shaped competing visions of freedom and hierarchy in a deeply divided nation.</p>\n\n<h2>Egypt inspires the pro-slavery South</h2>\n\n<p>In 1819, when lawyer <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/john-overton/\">John Overton</a>, military officer <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/james-winchester/\">James Winchester</a> and future president <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/andrew-jackson/\">Andrew Jackson</a> <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/memphis/\">founded a city in Tennessee</a> along the Mississippi River, they christened it Memphis, after the ancient Egyptian capital. </p>\n\n<p>While promoting the new city, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkbbg\">Overton declared</a> of the Mississippi River that ran alongside it: “This noble river may, with propriety, be denominated the American Nile.”</p>\n\n<p>“Who can tell that she may not, in time, rival … her ancient namesake, of Egypt in classic elegance and art?” <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn82007022/1849-11-06/ed-1/?sp=2&amp;q=A+Trip+to+Memphis+ancient+\">The Arkansas Banner excitedly reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the region’s fertile soil, <a href=\"https://ia801309.us.archive.org/23/items/proslaveryargume00phil/proslaveryargume00phil.pdf\">Chancellor William Harper</a>, a jurist and pro-slavery theorist from South Carolina, saw the promise of an agricultural empire built on slavery, one “capable of being made a far greater Egypt.” </p>\n\n<p>There was a reason pro-slavery businessmen and thinkers were energized by the prospect of an American Egypt: Many Southern planters imagined themselves as guardians of a hierarchical and aristocratic system, one grounded in landownership, tradition and honor. As Alabama newspaper editor <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moajrnl/acf2679.0030.006/405\">William Falconer</a> put it, he and his fellow white Southerners belonged to a “race that had established law, order, and government on earth.”</p>\n\n<p>To them, Egypt represented the archetype of a great hierarchical civilization. Older than Athens or Rome, Egypt conferred a special legitimacy. And just like the pharaohs, the white elites of the South saw themselves as the stewards of a prosperous society sustained by enslaved labor.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Colorful drawing of people loading bales of cotton onto steamboats.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The founders of Memphis named it after the ancient Egyptian capital, and they hoped the Mississippi River that ran alongside it would become an ‘American Nile.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/loading-cotton-onto-a-ship-memphis-tennessee-usa-c1900s-news-photo/463970447?adppopup=true\">The Print Collector/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Leading pro-slavery thinkers like Virginia social theorist <a href=\"https://ia800209.us.archive.org/1/items/sociologyforsout00fitz/sociologyforsout00fitz.pdf\">George Fitzhugh</a>, South Carolina lawyer and U.S. Senator <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41698071\">Robert Barnwell Rhett</a> and Georgia lawyer and politician <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawof01cobbiala/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">Thomas R.R. Cobb</a> all invoked Egypt as an example to follow.</p>\n\n<p>“These [Egyptian] monuments show negro slaves in Egypt at least 1,600 years before Christ,” Cobb <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawof01cobbiala\">wrote in 1858</a>. “That they were the same happy negroes of this day is proven by their being represented in a dance 1,300 years before Christ.”</p>\n\n<h2>A distorted view of history</h2>\n\n<p>But their view of history didn’t exactly square with reality. Slavery did exist in ancient Egypt, but most slaves had been originally captured as prisoners of war.</p>\n\n<p>The country never developed a system of slavery comparable to that of Greece or Rome, and servitude was neither race-based nor tied to a plantation economy. The mistaken notion that Egypt’s great monuments were built by slaves largely stems from <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/herodotus-histories-loeb/Herodotus_Histories_Loeb/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">ancient authors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201&amp;version=NIV\">the biblical account of the Hebrews</a>. Later, popular culture – especially <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/\">Hollywood epics</a> – would continue to advance this misconception.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, 19th-century Southern intellectuals drew on this imagined Egypt to legitimize slavery as an ancient and divinely sanctioned institution.</p>\n\n<p>Even after the Civil War, which ended in 1865, nostalgia for these myths of ancient Egypt endured. In 1877, former Confederate officer <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/howworldwaspeopl00fontuoft/page/n5/mode/2up\">Edward Fontaine</a> noted how “Veritable specimens of black, woolyheaded negroes are represented by the old Egyptian artists in chains, as slaves, and even singing and dancing, as we have seen them on Southern plantations in the present century.”</p>\n\n<h2>Turning Egypt white</h2>\n\n<p>But to claim their place among the world’s great civilizations, Southerners had to reconcile a troubling fact: Egypt was located in Africa, the ancestral land of those enslaved in the U.S. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A colorful drawing of a young queen with a gilded headdress being embraced from behind by a man wearing a gilded helmet.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A collectible tobacco card depicts actors Claudette Colbert and Henry Wilcoxon in a still from the 1934 film ‘Cleopatra.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/collectible-tobacco-or-cigarette-card-shots-from-famous-news-photo/1306152870?adppopup=true\">Nextrecord Archives/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In response, an intellectual movement called the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.pittstate.edu/etd/105/\">American School of Ethnology</a> – which promoted the idea that races had separate, unequal origins to justify Black inferiority and slavery – set out to “whiten” Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>In a series of texts and lectures, they portrayed Egypt as a slaveholding civilization dominated by whites. They pointed to Egyptian monuments as proof of the greatness that a slave society could achieve. And they also promoted a scientifically discredited theory called “<a href=\"https://www.history.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/History-of-the-Human-Sciences-2013-Keel-3-32.pdf\">polygenesis</a>,” which argued that Black people did not descend from the Bible’s Adam, but from some other source. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/evidenceagainstv1833colf/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">Richard Colfax</a>, the author of the 1833 pamphlet “Evidence Against the Views of the Abolitionists,” insisted that “the Egyptians were decidedly of the Caucasian variety of men.” Most mummies, he added, “bear not the most distant resemblance to the negro race.” </p>\n\n<p>Physician Samuel George Morton cited “<a href=\"https://ia801300.us.archive.org/35/items/craniaaegyptiac00mortgoog/craniaaegyptiac00mortgoog.pdf\">Crania Aegyptiaca</a>,” an 1822 German study of Egyptian skulls, to reinforce this view.  Writing in the Charleston Medical Journal in 1851, he explained how the German study had concluded that the skulls mirrored those of Europeans in size and shape.

Van Evrie</a> formed an effective triumvirate: Through press releases and public lectures featuring the skulls of mummies, they turned Egyptology into a tool of pro-slavery propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>“The Negro question was the one I wished to bring out,” <a href=\"https://books.google.fr/books/about/Pro_slavery_Thought_in_the_Old_South.html?hl=fr&amp;id=1dN2AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Nott wrote</a>, adding that he “embalmed it in Egyptian ethnography.”</p>\n\n<p>Nott and Gliddon’s 1854 bestseller “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/typesofmankindor01nott/page/n9/mode/2up\">Types of Mankind</a>” fused pseudoscience with Egyptology to both “prove” Black inferiority and advance the idea that their beloved African civilization was populated by a white Egyptian elite.</p>\n\n<p>“Negroes were numerous in Egypt,” they write, “but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is, that of servants and slaves.”</p>\n\n<h2>Denouncing America’s pharaohs</h2>\n\n<p>This distorted vision of Egypt, however, wasn’t the only one to take hold in the U.S., and abolitionists saw this history through a decidedly different lens.</p>\n\n<p>In the Bible, Egypt occupies a central place, mentioned repeatedly as a land of refuge – <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/143035/jewish/The-Story-of-Joseph-in-the-Bible.htm\">notably for Joseph</a> – but also as a nation of idolatry and as the cradle of slavery. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201&amp;version=NIV\">The episode of the Exodus</a> is perhaps the most famous reference. The Hebrews, enslaved under an oppressive pharaoh, are freed by Moses, who leads them to the Promised Land, Canaan. This biblical image of Egypt as a land of bondage deeply shaped 19th-century moral and political debates: For many abolitionists, it represented the ultimate symbol of tyranny and human oppression.</p>\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/emancipation-proclamation\">Emancipation Proclamation</a> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1863, <a href=\"https://books.google.fr/books?id=YHgv011kWIAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Black people could be heard</a> singing in front of the White House, “Go down Moses, way down in Egypt Land … Tell Jeff Davis to let my people go.” </p>\n\n<p>Black Americans seized upon this biblical parallel.

Now I teach a course at Rowan University on the history of organized crime, using the war as a case study, and I was a consultant on the Netflix series. </p>\n\n<p>The war pitted one faction of the Philadelphia mob, headed by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090413231924/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/22/us/jury-convicts-philadelphia-s-mob-leader.html\">Sicilian-born John Stanfa</a>, against a <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/11/21/Jury-convicts-Philadelphia-mob-boss/8470816930000/\">rival faction led by Joseph “Skinny Joey” Merlino</a>. The issues were control of all illegal operations in the underworld – gambling, loan-sharking, drug-dealing and extortion. Money was the bottom line, but there also was a cultural and generational divide that had Stanfa and, for the most part, his group of older wiseguys facing off against Merlino and his <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/joey-merlino-arrested-major-mob-bust/\">crew of young South Philadelphia-born mobsters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But only after indictments were handed down and evidence was introduced at trials did the extent of the electronic surveillance operation become known.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bWSDB6CHQ8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A trailer for ‘Mob War: Philadelphia vs. The Mafia’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>‘Goodfellas kill goodfellas’</h2>\n\n<p>Mobsters, speaking in unguarded moments and unaware that the feds were listening, buried themselves.    </p>\n\n<p>So here was mob boss Stanfa discussing with an associate plans to lure Merlino and two of his two lieutenants to a meeting where they would be killed:</p>\n\n<p>“See, you no gotta give a chance,” the Sicilian-born Stanfa said in his halting English. “Bam, bam … Over here is best, behind the ear.”</p>\n\n<p>Or here was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWLJP0ndEVY\">Salvatore Profaci</a>, a New York mobster brought in to quietly settle a dispute that had gone public after mob lawyer <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/obituaries/20140205_Salvatore_J__Avena__87__branded_as_a_mob_lawyer.html\">Salvatore Avena</a> filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against his mobbed-up business partner in a trash-hauling business.</p>\n\n<p>“Goodfellas don’t sue goodfellas,” Profaci said in a line that couldn’t have been written any better by “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/04/27/archives/the-godfather-by-mario-puzo-446-pp-new-york-g-p-putnams-sons-695.html\">The Godfather</a>” author Mario Puzo or delivered more effectively by the award-winning actor <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/\">Robert De Niro</a>. “Goodfellas kill goodfellas.”</p>\n\n<p>The most staggering piece of the investigation, which was made known only after Stanfa and more than 20 of his associates had been indicted and arrested, was that the FBI had received court authorization to plant listening devices in the Camden, New Jersey, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/fbi-arrests-reputed-leader-of-philadelphia-mob-and-23-others.html\">law offices of Salvatore Avena</a>, Stanfa’s defense attorney.</p>\n\n<p>A judge approved the highly unusual authorization after the feds argued that Stanfa was using the shield of attorney-client privilege to conduct mob meetings in Avena’s office while a mob war raged on the streets of South Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia-1?variant=40971505106978\">More than 2,000 conversations were recorded</a> during the two-year electronic surveillance operation, with FBI agents and an assistant U.S. attorney manning a listening post in the basement of the federal courthouse a block away from Avena’s office. Whenever Stanfa and his associates got together, the feds were listening. Many of those conversations were then introduced as evidence at the racketeering trials that followed.  </p>\n\n<p>The conversations proved to be a treasure trove not only for investigators but also for journalists who covered the story as it unfolded and later got access to the tapes that were made public when the cases went to trial.</p>\n\n<h2>Blood in the streets</h2>\n\n<p>Two of the books I’ve written about the Philadelphia mob, “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-last-gangster-george-anastasia?variant=40973399883810\">The Last Gangster</a>” in 2004 and “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia?variant=40971505074210\">The Goodfella Tapes</a>” in 1998, are built around those tapes and the investigations they spawned.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who has written true crime knows that part of the problem with nonfiction storytelling is coming up with dialogue. In writing books about the Philadelphia mob wars that are the focus of the new Netflix series, that was never a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Mobsters from Philadelphia, South Jersey, New York and the Scanton-Wilkes Barre area of Pennsylvania ended up on the recordings, which offered not only details about the war but also included philosophical ramblings and personal asides that provided a glimpse into the world of organized crime as good as or better than any fictionalized story line from “The Godfather” or “The Sopranos.”</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the conflict, as bodies piled up and blood ran in the streets of the City of Brotherly Love, Stanfa and several of his associates were picked up <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia?variant=40971505074210\">plotting murder and mayhem</a>, bemoaning the loss of honor and loyalty that had once been the hallmark of Cosa Nostra, and belittling their street-corner rivals, the “little Americans” who hadn’t a clue about what it meant to be a real mafioso.</p>\n\n<p>“When you’re a dwarf they could put you on a high mountain, you’re still a dwarf,” Avena told Stanfa in one of several conversations mocking Merlino and his associates.</p>\n\n<p>“I was born and raised in this thing (Cosa Nostra) and I’m gonna die in this thing,” said Stanfa at another point, bemoaning the state of the Philadelphia mob. “But with the right people. Over here is like kindergarten.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Man wearing sunglasses stands in front of people holding video camera and microphones\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Former Philadelphia mob boss ‘Skinny’ Joey Merlino, pictured here in 1997.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/NotRealNews/0a5bb7504d154b4dbc8672f1076f4c8b/photo\">AP Photo/H.

Several of his top associates were jailed for more than 20 years. In a second prosecution, Merlino and most of his top associates were <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/20141012__quot_That_s_Joey_Merlino_quot_.html\">convicted of racketeering</a> and jailed for sentences ranging from seven to 14 years. </p>\n\n<p>Dozens of conversations were played for the juries that sat in judgment during the racketeering trials that followed. Again and again the mobster’s own words were turned against them.</p>\n\n<p>Another highlight was an FBI surveillance video of a <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-215-9673nhvw\">mob hit picked up on a hidden camera</a> as it occurred. A surveillance camera located across the street from a deli run by then-Stanfa underboss Joseph Ciancaglini Jr. picked up the early morning shooting in which four shadowy figures burst into the deli and opened fire. An audio bug hidden inside the deli provided the sound effects – gunshots, shouting and the screams of a waitress. The shooting occurred shortly after 6 a.m. and just moments after Ciancaglini and his waitress had arrived and begun setting up for business.  </p>\n\n<p>Cooperating witnesses were also part of the trial, but defense attorneys frequently undermined their testimony by providing a litany of the crimes – often including murders – that the witnesses had admitted to as part of their plea deals.</p>\n\n<p>You can attack the credibility of a cooperating witness by focusing on his own crimes and his need to say whatever the government wants in order to win a lenient sentence, a defense attorney once explained to me. What you can’t do, he said, “is cross-examine a tape.”</p>\n\n<p>Jurors got to hear mobsters in their own words discussing the mob war. And there was nothing the defense could do to counterattack the impact of those words.</p>\n\n<p>One classic discussion underscored the mobsters’ concern about electronic surveillance and demonstrated their inability to do much about it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/09/27/Mob-trial-begins-in-Philadelphia/5051812174400/\">Stanfa consigliere Anthony Piccolo</a> was talking with Avena about the problem with cooperators and phone taps. Both men agreed it was important to be cautious. Avena then told Piccolo that he’d had an electronic anti-bugging expert come into his office over the weekend and had swept the rooms. It had cost him $500, Avena said.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s money well spent,” said Piccolo as the undetected FBI listening device beamed the conversation back to the listening post.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267196/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>George Anastasia is the owner of G&amp;A Media LLC, the company through which he served as consultant for the series and through which he was paid, .  </span></em></p>",

Earlier in the year, a U.S. Navy destroyer <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/iran-navy-destroyer-iran-navy-blocks-us-destroyer-uss-fitzgerald-near-territorial-waters-what-happened/articleshow/122872499.cms?from=mdr\">bobbed along waters close to Iran</a> for similar reasons. And in the Taiwan Straits and Pacific, <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/09/11/chinas-newest-aircraft-carrier-sails-toward-taiwan-strait\">China</a> <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/09/16/u-s-u-k-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-pentagon-confirms\">and the U.S.</a> frequently show off their respective maritime military might.</p>\n\n<p>Close to 200 years after first being used to assert geopolitical dominance, <a href=\"https://www.thecollector.com/gunboat-diplomacy-military-power/\">gunboat diplomacy</a> is very much alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the tactics employed by the U.S., China and others today fit naval strategist James Cable’s <a href=\"https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_feb01ghp01.html\">classic formulation</a> for gunboat diplomacy as “the use or threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or avert loss.”</p>\n\n<p>The ships, boats and objectives have shifted since Cable first penned his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gunboatdiplomacy0000cabl_l5k2\">now-classic definition in 1971</a>, to be sure. But the core logic is the same: Conducted in tandem with political diplomacy, deploying state-of-the-art military vessels off or near a rival’s coast makes one hell of a statement.</p>\n\n<h2>Gunboat diplomacy sets sail</h2>\n\n<p>Gunboat diplomacy originally took shape in the mid-19th century during an era of industrial navies, imperial rivalry and weak international law. </p>\n\n<p>Steam power and heavy guns delivered mobility and shock, while diplomacy often happened via a few warships off a harbor, a short blockade or a punitive raid.

Anchoring in Tokyo Bay throughout 1853–54, they helped secure the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/treaty-of-kanagawa\">Treaty of Kanagawa</a> in 1854, forcibly opening the Japanese ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, during <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pacifico-david#:%7E:text=Pacifico%20demanded%20a%20sum%20of,incidents%20of%20mid%2DVictorian%20Britain.\">the Don Pacifico affair of 1850</a>, British navy squadrons pressured Greece to compensate a British subject.</p>\n\n<p>A half-century later, Britain, Germany and Italy united to <a href=\"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2019/4/30/the-venezuela-crisis-revisited\">impose a naval blockade on Venezuela</a>, seizing ships and customs houses to force the Venezuelan government to pay its foreign debts.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, a limited naval force was openly brandished at a chokepoint or capital to win a narrow concession and then withdraw.</p>\n\n<h2>Troubled postwar waters</h2>\n\n<p>After 1945, nuclear risk, alliance politics and evolving maritime law made traditional gunboat diplomacy less attractive – and riskier.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the method adapted.

Brown/Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Halloween is a fun, scary time for children and adults alike – but why does the holiday seem to start so much earlier every year? Decades ago, when I was young, Halloween was a much smaller affair, and people didn’t start preparing until mid-October. Today, in my neighborhood near where I grew up in Massachusetts, Halloween decorations start appearing in the middle of summer.</p>\n\n<p>What’s changed isn’t just when we celebrate but how: Halloween has evolved from a simple folk tradition to a massive commercial event. As a <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jay-zagorsky/%22%22\">business school professor</a> who has studied the economics of holidays for years, I’m astounded by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-halloween-spending-growing-when-americans-are-supposedly-cutting-back-242101\">how the business of Halloween has grown</a>. And understanding why it’s such big business may help explain why it’s creeping earlier and earlier.</p>\n\n<h2>The business of Halloween</h2>\n\n<p>Halloween’s roots lie in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/halloweens-celebration-of-mingling-with-the-dead-has-roots-in-ancient-celtic-celebrations-of-samhain-191300\">a Celtic holiday</a> honoring the dead, later <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/history-of-halloween%23section_3\">adapted by the Catholic Church</a> as a time to remember saints. Today it’s largely a secular celebration – one that gives people from all backgrounds a chance to dress up, engage in fantasy and safely confront their fears.</p>\n\n<p>That broad appeal has fueled explosive growth. The <a href=\"https://nrf.com/\">National Retail Federation</a> has <a href=\"https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween\">surveyed Americans about their Halloween plans</a> each September since 2005. Back then, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween/halloween-data-center\">slightly more than half of Americans said they planned to celebrate</a>. In 2025, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion\">nearly three-quarters</a> said they would – a huge jump in 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>And people are <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion\">planning to shell out</a> more money than ever. Total spending on Halloween is expected to reach a record US$13 billion this year, according to the federation – an almost fourfold increase over the past two decades. Adjusting for <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html\">population growth</a>, I found that the average American will spend an expected $38 on Halloween this year – up from just $18 per person back in 2005. That’s a lot of candy corn.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"ZtQxQ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZtQxQ/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dataweb.usitc.gov/\">Candy imports</a> show a similar trend. September has long been the key month for the candy trade, with imports about one-fifth higher than during the rest of the year. Back in September 2005, the U.S. imported about $250 million of the sweet stuff. In September 2024, that figure had tripled to about $750 million.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of a larger trend of Halloween becoming a lot more professionalized. For example, when I was a kid, it wasn’t unusual for households to pass out brownies, candied apples and other homemade treats to trick-or-treaters. But because of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/halloween-safety-tips-costumes-candy-and-colored-contact-lenses\">safety concerns and food allergies</a>, for decades Americans have been warned to stick to mass-produced, individually wrapped candies.</p>\n\n<p>The same shift has happened with costumes. Years ago, many people made their own; today, store-bought costumes dominate — <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/half-a-billion-on-halloween-pet-costumes-is-latest-sign-of-americas-out-of-control-consumerism-125991\">even for pets</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Halloween keeps creeping earlier</h2>\n\n<p>While there’s no definitive research establishing why Halloween seems to start earlier each year, the increase in spending is one major driver.</p>\n\n<p>Halloween items are seasonal, which means no one wants to buy <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/giant-ground-breaking-skeleton.product.4000256751.html\">giant plastic skeletons</a> on Nov. 1. As total spending grows, retailers order more inventory, and the cost of storing ever-larger amounts of unsold items until the next year becomes a bigger consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Once a season’s commercial footprint becomes large enough, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1110.0693\">retailers begin ordering and displaying merchandise</a> long before it’s actually needed. For example, winter coats start appearing in stores in early fall and are typically gone when the snow starts falling. It’s the same with Halloween: Retailers put out merchandise early to ensure they’re not stuck with unsold goods once the season is over.</p>\n\n<p>They also often price strategically – charging full price when items first hit the shelves, appealing to eager early shoppers, and then marking down prices closer to the holiday. This clears shelves and warehouses, making room for the next upcoming shopping season.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past two decades, Halloween has become an ever-bigger commercial holiday. The growth in people enjoying the holiday and the increase in spending has resulted in Halloween becoming one giant treat for businesses. The big trick for retailers is preventing this holiday from starting before the Fourth of July.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267716/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jay L.

Picture pixels in an image. The smaller the grid pieces, or cells, the higher the resolution and the more accurate the forecast. However, creating many small cells across a large area requires greater computing power, so forecasting storm surge takes longer as a result. </p>\n\n<p>Forecasters can use low-resolution computer grids to speed up the process, but that reduces accuracy, leaving communities with more uncertainty about their flood risk.</p>\n\n<p>AI can help speed that up.</p>\n\n<h2>How AI can create better forecasts</h2>\n\n<p>There are two main sources of uncertainty in storm surge predictions.</p>\n\n<p>One involves the data fed into the computer model. A hurricane’s storm track and wind field, which determine where it will make landfall and how intense the surge will be, are <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/pdfs/Verification_2024.pdf\">still hard to forecast</a> accurately more than a few days in advance. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3125-2023\">Changes to the coast and sea floor</a>, such as from channel dredging or loss of salt marshes, mangroves or sand dunes, can affect the resistance that storm surge will face.</p>\n\n<p>The second uncertainty involves the resolution of the computational grid, over which the mathematical equations of the surge and wave motion are solved. The resolution determines how well the model sees changes in landscape elevation and land cover and accounts for them, and at how much granularity the physics of hurricane surge and waves is solved.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Detailed storm surge models can provide more specific information about expected flood height.

For example, engineers and scientists have developed AI models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD037617\">based on deep neural networks</a> that can predict water levels along the coastline quickly and accurately by using data about the wind field. In some cases, these models have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2024.104504\">been more accurate</a> than traditional hydrodynamic models.</p>\n\n<p>AI can also develop forecasts for areas with little historic data, or be used to understand extreme conditions that may not have occurred there before. </p>\n\n<p>For these forecasts, physics-based models can be used to generate synthetic data to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-015-2111-1\">train the AI</a> on scenarios that might be possible but haven’t actually happened. Once an AI model is trained on both the historic and synthetic data, it can quickly generate surge forecasts using details about the wind and atmospheric pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Training the AI on data from hydrodynamic models can also improve its ability to quickly generate inundation risk maps showing which streets or houses are likely to flood in extreme events that may not have a historical precedent but could happen in the future.  </p>\n\n<h2>The future of AI for hurricane forecasting</h2>\n\n<p>AI is <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/hurricane-forecast-ai-artificial-intelligence\">already being used</a> in operational storm surge forecasts in a limited way, mainly to augment the commonly used physics-based models.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to improving those methods, my team and other researchers have been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2024.104504\">developing ways to use AI</a> for storm surge prediction using observed data, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.12658\">assessing the damage after hurricanes</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2023.105939\">processing camera images to deduce flood intensity</a>. That can fill a critical gap in the data needed for validating storm surge models at granular levels.</p>\n\n<p>As artificial intelligence models rapidly spread through every aspect of our lives and more data becomes available for training them, the technology offers potential to improve hurricane and storm surge forecasting in the future, giving coastal communities faster and more detailed warnings about the risks on the way.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259007/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Navid Tahvildari&#39;s research on coastal flooding has been funded by NSF, NOAA, NASA, and DOT. </span></em></p>",

Based on your preferences, I’ve found three restaurants near your hotel. Would you like me to make a reservation?”</p>\n\n<p>You didn’t ask for this. The AI simply knew your plans from scanning your calendar and email and decided to help. Later, you mention to the chatbot needing flowers for your wife’s birthday. Within seconds, beautiful arrangements appear in the chat. You tap one: “Buy now.” Done. The flowers are ordered.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t science fiction. On Sept. 29, 2025, OpenAI and payment processor <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a> launched the <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/\">Agentic Commerce Protocol</a>. This technology lets you buy things instantly from Etsy within ChatGPT conversations. ChatGPT users are scheduled to gain access to over 1 million other Shopify merchants, from major household brand names to small shops as well.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=P8fhrcwAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">marketing researchers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=D2pc8ugAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">who study</a> how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.21649\">AI affects consumer behavior</a>, we believe we’re seeing the beginning of the biggest shift in how people shop since smartphones arrived. Most people have no idea it’s happening.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dU2CfpOGU_c?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT takes on e-commerce with Etsy, Shopify partnership.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From searching to being served</h2>\n\n<p>For three decades, the internet has worked the same way: You want something, you Google it, you compare options, you decide, you buy. You’re in control.</p>\n\n<p>That era is ending.</p>\n\n<p>AI shopping assistants are evolving through three phases. First came “on-demand AI.” You ask ChatGPT a question, it answers. That’s where most people are today.</p>\n\n<p>Now we’re entering “ambient AI,” where <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/\">AI suggests things before you ask</a>. ChatGPT monitors your calendar, reads your emails and offers recommendations without being asked.</p>\n\n<p>Soon comes “autopilot AI,” where AI makes purchases for you with minimal input from you. “Order flowers for my anniversary next week.” ChatGPT checks your calendar, remembers preferences, processes payment and confirms delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Each phase adds convenience but gives you less control.</p>\n\n<h2>The manipulation problem</h2>\n\n<p>AI’s responses create what researchers call an “advice illusion.” When ChatGPT suggests three hotels, you don’t see them as ads. They feel like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend. But you don’t know whether those hotels paid for placement or whether better options exist that ChatGPT didn’t show you.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional advertising is something most people have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/13522751211191973\">learned to recognize and dismiss</a>. But AI recommendations feel objective even when they’re not. With one-tap purchasing, the entire process happens so smoothly that you might not pause to compare options.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI isn’t alone in this race. In the same month, Google announced its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/09/22/the-google-ap2-payment-protocol-will-trigger-interesting-innovation/\">competing protocol, AP2</a>. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are building similar systems. Whoever wins will be in position to control how billions of people buy things, potentially capturing a percentage of trillions of dollars in annual transactions.</p>\n\n<h2>What we’re giving up</h2>\n\n<p>This convenience comes with costs most people haven’t thought about.</p>\n\n<p>Privacy: For AI to suggest restaurants, it needs to read your calendar and emails. For it to buy flowers, it needs your purchase history. People will be trading total surveillance for convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Choice: Right now, you see multiple options when you search. With AI as the middleman, you might see only three options ChatGPT chooses. Entire businesses could become invisible if AI chooses to ignore them.</p>\n\n<p>Power of comparing: When ChatGPT suggests products with one-tap checkout, the friction that made you pause and compare disappears.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s happening faster than you think</h2>\n\n<p>ChatGPT reached <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\">800 million weekly users</a> by September 2025, growing four times faster than social media platforms did. Major retailers began using OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol within days of its launch.</p>\n\n<p>History shows people consistently underestimate how quickly they adapt to convenient technologies. Not long ago most people wouldn’t think of getting in a stranger’s car. Uber now has <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/4826/uber-technologies/?srsltid=AfmBOooEKiBOI80u7bBcAdQJQTq2lJTLYQL0ENr1L6dZKtwCuxbagoxs#editorsPicks\">150 million users</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Convenience always wins. The question isn’t whether AI shopping will become mainstream. It’s whether people will keep any real control over what they buy and why.</p>\n\n<h2>What you can do</h2>\n\n<p>The open internet gave people a world of information and choice at their fingertips. The AI revolution could take that away. Not by forcing people, but by making it so easy to let the algorithm decide that they forget what it’s like to truly choose for themselves. Buying things is becoming as thoughtless as sending a text.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, a single company could become the gatekeeper for all digital shopping, with the potential for monopolization beyond even Amazon’s current dominance in e-commerce. We believe that it’s important to at least have a vigorous public conversation about whether this is the future people actually want. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some steps you can take to resist the lure of convenience:</p>\n\n<p>Question AI suggestions. When ChatGPT suggests products, recognize you’re seeing hand-picked choices, not all your options. Before one-tap purchases, pause and ask: Would I buy this if I had to visit five websites and compare prices?</p>\n\n<p>Review your privacy settings carefully. Understand what you’re trading for convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Talk about this with friends and family. The shift to AI shopping is happening without public awareness. The time to have conversations about acceptable limits is now, before one-tap purchasing becomes so normal that questioning it seems strange.</p>\n\n<h2>The invisible price tag</h2>\n\n<p>AI will learn what you want, maybe even before you want it.

Only 42% of democracies affected by autocratization – a transformation in governance that erodes democratic safeguards – since 1994 have rebounded after a democratic breakdown, <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/documents/61/v-dem-dr__2025_lowres_v2.pdf\">according to Swedish research institute V-Dem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Often termed “<a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/on-democratic-backsliding/\">democratic backsliding</a>,” such periods involve government-led changes to rules and norms to weaken individual freedoms and undermine or eliminate checks on power exercised by independent institutions, both governmental and non-governmental. </p>\n\n<p>Democracies that have suffered setbacks vary widely, from <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/new-kind-authoritarianism-democracy-decline-home-and-abroad\">Hungary to Brazil</a>. As a longterm <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/shelley-inglis-837513\">practitioner of democracy-building overseas</a>, I know that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/19/american-democracy-resilience-00548910\">none of these countries rival</a> the United States’ constitutional traditions, federalist system, economic wealth, military discipline, and vibrant independent media, academia and nonprofit organizations. </p>\n\n<p>Even so, practices used globally to fight democratic backsliding or topple autocracies <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/democracy-playbook-2025/\">can be instructive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell: Nonviolent resistance is based on noncooperation with autocratic actions. It <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/chen15682\">has proven more effective</a> in toppling autocracies than violent, armed struggle. </p>\n\n<p>But it requires more than street demonstrations. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXem-j3jjEk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">One pro-democracy organization helps train people to use video to document abuses by government.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Tactics used by pro-democracy movements</h2>\n\n<p>So, what does it take for democracies to <a href=\"https://v-dem.net/media/publications/PB__42.pdf\">bounce back from periods of autocratic rule</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Broad-scale, coordinated mobilization of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTckJzV1xIA\">a sufficient percentage of the population</a> against autocratic takeover and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/11/autocracy-resistance-social-movement/684336/\">for a renewed democratic future</a> is necessary for success. </p>\n\n<p>That momentum can be challenging to generate. Would-be autocrats create <a href=\"https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny\">environments of fear and powerlessness</a>, using intimidation, overwhelming force or political and legal attacks, and other coercive tactics to force acquiescence and chill democratic pushback. </p>\n\n<p>Autocrats can’t succeed alone. They rely on <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371371333_Breaking_Down_Pillars_of_Support_For_Democratic_Backsliding\">what scholars call “pillars of support”</a> – a range of government institutions, security forces, business and other sectors in society to obey their will and even bolster their power grabs.    </p>\n\n<p>However, everyone in society has power to erode autocratic support in various ways. While individual efforts are important, collective action increases impact and mitigates the risks of reprisals for standing up to individuals or organizations. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the tactics used by those movements across the world:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Refuse unlawful, corrupt demands</h2>\n\n<p>When enough individuals in critical roles and institutions – the military, civil servants, corporate leaders, state government and judges – refuse to implement autocratic orders, it can slow or even stop an autocratic takeover. In South Korea, parts of the civil service, legislature and military declined to support President Yoon Suk Yeol’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98lygwd837o\">imposition of martial law</a> in 2024, foiling his autocratic move. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Visibly bolster the rule of law</h2>\n\n<p>Where would-be autocrats disregard legal restraints and install their supporters in the highest courts, individual challenges to overreach, even if successful, can be insufficient. In Poland, legal challenges in courts combined with <a href=\"https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/all-rise-judicial-resistance-in-poland/\">public education by the judiciary</a>, lawyers’ associations initiatives and street protests like the <a href=\"https://www.iaj-uim.org/iuw/es/the-judiciary-possible-ways-of-development-march-of-a-thousand-robes-one-year-later/\">“March of a Thousand Robes” in 2020</a> to signal widespread repudiation of the autocratic government’s attacks on the rule of law.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Unite in opposition</h2>\n\n<p>This year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2025/machado/facts/\">Maria Corina Machado from Venezuela</a>, is an example of how political parties and leaders who cooperate across differences can offer an alternative vision. </p>\n\n<p>Novel candidates can undermine the ability of autocrats to sow division and demonize major opponents. However, coalitions can be <a href=\"https://www.smerconish.com/exclusive-content/how-can-21st-century-autocrats-be-removed-from-power-lessons-from-hungary/\">difficult to form and sustain to win</a>. Based on <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/poland-parliamentary-election-autocracy-tusk/675656/\">experiences overseas</a>, historian Anne Applebaum, author of “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/725302/autocracy-inc-by-anne-applebaum/\">Autocracy Inc.</a>,” has <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-weeknight/watch/historian-warns-a-chill-spreads-as-trump-admin-follows-familiar-authoritarian-playbook-248699461996\">called for a pro-democracy coalition</a> in the U.S. that could unite independents, Libertarians, the Green Party, dissident Republicans and the Democratic Party. </p>\n\n<h2>4. Harness economic power</h2>\n\n<p>Everyday consumers can pressure wealthy elites and corporations that acquiesce to, or prop up, would-be autocrats through boycotts and other methods, like the “<a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown\">Tesla Takedown</a>” in the U.S. that preceded <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jpmorgan-cuts-price-target-tesla-shares-brokerage-expects-lower-deliveries-2025-03-12/\">a drop in Tesla share value</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-signals-his-time-leading-doge-is-coming-to-an-end/\">owner Elon Musk’s departure from his government role</a>. General strikes, led by labor unions and <a href=\"https://civilresistance.info/sites/default/files/zunes-sudans-2019-revolution.pdf\">professional associations</a>, as in Sudan or Myanmar, can be particularly effective. </p>\n\n<h2>5. Preempt electoral manipulation</h2>\n\n<p>Voting autocrats out of office remains the best way to restore democracy, demonstrated recently by the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/after-a-victory-for-democracy-what-is-brazils-road-ahead/\">u-turn in Brazil</a>, where a pro-democracy candidate defeated the hard-right incumbent. But this requires strategic action to keep elections truly free and fair well in advance of election day.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Organize your community</h2>\n\n<p>As in campaigns in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/indias-farmers-protest-an-inclusive-vision-of-indian-democracy/78B4021417116DCC65F05177645AA34F\">India</a> starting in 2020 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/chile-crisis-town-hall-meetings-neighbours\">Chile</a> in 2019, participating in community or private conversation forums, local town halls or councils, and nonpartisan student, veterans, farmers, women’s and religious groups provides the space to share concerns, exchange ideas and create avenues to take action. Often starting with trusted networks, local initiatives can tap into broader statewide or national efforts to defend democracy. </p>\n\n<h2>7. Shape the story</h2>\n\n<p>Driving <a href=\"https://www.ned.org/winning-the-battle-of-ideas-exposing-global-authoritarian-narratives-and-revitalizing-democratic-principles/\">public opinion and communicating effectively</a> is critical to pro-democracy efforts. Serbian students created one of the <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/online-exclusive/how-serbian-students-created-the-largest-protest-movement-in-decades/\">largest protest movements in decades</a> starting in 2024 using <a href=\"https://eajournals.org/gjahss/vol13-issue-5-2025/creative-resistance-the-role-of-art-activism-in-advancing-social-justice/\">creative resistance</a> – artistic expression, such as visual mediums, satire and social media – to expose an autocrat’s weaknesses, reduce fear and hopelessness and build collective symbolism and resilience. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Build bridges and democratic alternatives</h2>\n\n<p>Bringing together people across ideological and other divides can increase understanding and counter political polarization, particularly when religious leaders are involved. <a href=\"https://www.yuva.org.tr/en/izmir-citizens-assembly-for-climate/\">Even in autocratic countries like Turkey</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/kyiv/local-initiatives.-success-stories\">during wartime as in Ukraine</a>, deepening democratic practices at state and local levels, <a href=\"https://ecnl.org/news/citizens-assemblies-participatory-democracy-action\">like citizen assemblies</a> and the use of technologies that improve the quality of public decision-making, can demonstrate ways to govern differently. </p>\n\n<p>Parallel institutions, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-nov-30-mn-49188-story.html?utm_source\">such as schools and tax systems</a> operating outside the formal repressive system, like during <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Kosovo-conflict\">Slobodan Milosevic’s decade-long crackdown in Kosovo</a>, have sustained non-cooperation and shaped a future vision. </p>\n\n<h2>9. Document abuses, protect people, reinforce truth</h2>\n\n<p>With today’s technologies, every citizen can <a href=\"https://www.witness.org/\">record repressive incidents</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-navalny-corruption-foundation/31938527.html\">track corruption</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5517973/smithsonian-document-citizen-historians\">archive historical evidence</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.citizenhistorians.org/\">preserving proof of slavery</a> at danger of being removed in public museums in the U.S., or <a href=\"https://syrianarchive.org/en/\">collecting documentation of human rights violations in Syria</a>. This can also entail bearing witness, including by <a href=\"https://pbiusa.org/en/who-we-accompany-us\">accompanying those most targeted</a> with abusive government tactics. These techniques can bolster the survival of independent and evidence-based media, science and collective memory.    </p>\n\n<h2>10. Mitigate risk, learn and innovate</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-future-of-nonviolent-resistance-2/\">success rate of nonviolent civil resistance is declining</a> while <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-regimes-are-expanding-ways-intimidate-and-silence-opponents\">repressive tactics by autocrats are evolving</a>. Democracy defenders are forced to rapidly adjust, consistently train, prepare for diverse scenarios, try new techniques and <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2022/09/five-strategies-to-support-us-democracy?lang=en\">strategically support each other</a>. </p>\n\n<p>International solidarity from global institutions, like European Union support for democrats <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/belarus/\">in Belarus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/eu-statement-georgia_en\">Georgia</a>, or online movements, like the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-9655-1_7\">Milk Tea Alliance across Southeast Asia</a>, can bolster efforts.  </p>\n\n<h2>Democracy’s future?</h2>\n\n<p>The end of American democracy is not a foregone conclusion, despite the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2025-03-25/democracy-expert-raises-alarm-about-u-s-trends-under-trump\">unprecedented rate</a> of its decline. It will depend, in part, on the choices made by every American. </p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/36317/autocracies-outnumber-democracies-for-the-first-time-in-20-years-v-dem/\">autocracies outnumbering democracies for the first time in 20 years</a>, and only 12% of the world’s population now <a href=\"https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/36317/autocracies-outnumber-democracies-for-the-first-time-in-20-years-v-dem/\">living in a liberal democracy</a>, the future of the global democratic experiment may well depend on the people of the United States.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266432/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Until July 1, 2025, Shelley Inglis served as a Senior Policy Advisor in the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Governance of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). </span></em></p>",

One reason is that 46 states, including Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/press-room/details/almost-all-states-began-new-fiscal-year-with-enacted-budgets\">begin their new fiscal year on July 1</a>. The federal government’s fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. Even a state like Pennsylvania, that has had late budgets for <a href=\"https://www.politicspa.com/a-history-of-late-pennsylvania-state-budgets/142479/\">eight of the last 10 years</a>, would have to be very late in passing a budget for it to potentially coincide with a federal budget impasse. And, of course, federal government shutdowns <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/30/us/politics/previous-government-shutdowns.html\">do not happen all the time</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Men in suits shown in shadow underneath elaborate ceiling with arches\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697009/original/file-20251017-56-van1un.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A group of Republican senators talk at the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 15, 2025, during a government shutdown that began Oct. 1.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/sen-james-lankford-senate-majority-leader-john-thune-senate-news-photo/2240791863\">Andrew Harnik via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov.

The Democrats control the state House <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pennsylvania-will-keep-its-divided-legislature-thanks-to-split-ticket-voters-243187\">by a single seat</a>, whereas the Republicans have a comfortable majority in the Senate. </p>\n\n<p>The parties have been debating over the last several budget cycles how to handle funding surpluses – much of which came from Biden-era legislation like the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/joe-bidens-record-on-science-and-tech-investments-and-regulation-for-vaccines-broadband-microchips-and-ai-247164\">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> – and when and how to deal with the inevitable end to those surpluses. </p>\n\n<p>This year, the two sides are far apart on their views of the proper spending level.</p>\n\n<p>The Democrats in the House passed a <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/budget-pennsylvania-impasse-house-senate-conflict-capitol/\">US$50.3 billion spending plan</a>, but Senate Republicans want to keep state spending flat at $47.6 billion.

Democrats have dug in over reversing <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-government-shutdown-is-hitting-the-health-care-system-and-what-the-battle-over-aca-subsidies-means-266565\">cuts to health care</a> from the earlier passed “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/one-big-beautiful-bill-obbb-175567\">one big beautiful bill</a>” and expiring Obamacare subsidies. </p>\n\n<p>There is little sign of an immediate end to either impasse.</p>\n\n<p>In Pennsylvania, there is <a href=\"https://www.witf.org/2025/10/08/tensions-boil-over-in-capitol-as-pennsylvania-lawmakers-hit-100-days-without-a-budget/\">growing frustration</a> on both sides about an inability to compromise. Nationally, House Speaker <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-trump-obamacare-republicans-democrats-b6b59cae2ec28b39e57fbb703704f46a\">Mike Johnson has speculated</a> that this may end up being the longest federal government shutdown in history. In neither case, though, does there seem to be a great deal of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/podcasts/the-daily/government-shutdown-trump.html?rref=vanity\">urgency in coming to a compromise</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Effects on Pennsylvania</h2>\n\n<p>These dual crises are affecting Pennsylvanians in many ways. The state government continues to function even without a budget, but <a href=\"https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2025-10-02/pa-budget-impasse-counties-services-shapiro\">counties</a>, <a href=\"https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/with-no-end-to-budget-impasse-in-sight-pa-school-districts-and-counties-warn-of-program-cuts/\">school districts</a> and <a href=\"https://pano.org/advocacy/2025-26-pa-budget-impasse-nonprofit-community-impact/\">nonprofit organizations</a> that rely on state funding are being forced to make difficult operating choices.</p>\n\n<p>Some counties like <a href=\"https://www.wtae.com/article/westmoreland-county-employees-demand-action-state-budget-furloughs/68993716\">Westmoreland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/northampton-county/hundreds-of-northampton-co-workers-could-be-furloughed-if-pa-lawmakers-dont-pass-budget/article_a9907065-e4ee-4e80-90c5-cd8d11d31594.html\">Northampton</a> are beginning the process of furloughing employees. School districts are <a href=\"https://www.butlereagle.com/20251001/schools-eye-loans-as-state-budget-impasse-creeps-into-october/\">taking out loans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wtaj.com/news/local-news/cambria-county-commissioners-approve-loan-to-fund-programs-workers/\">freezing hiring</a> and deferring spending. The state already owes school districts <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-budget-impasse-education/\">more than $3 billion</a> in missed payments for the past three months. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Woman reaches for loaf of bread on shelf that contains food products\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697008/original/file-20251017-66-4mbddx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cozy Wilkins, 66, stocks the shelves at New Bethany, a nonprofit that provides food access, housing and social services, in Bethlehem, Pa., on July, 22, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cozy-wilkins-stocks-the-shelves-at-new-bethany-a-non-profit-news-photo/2162830910\">Ryan Collerd/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The social safety net is also fraying as social service organizations, like <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2025/10/16/pennsylvania-rape-crisis-centers-state-budget-josh-shapiro/stories/202510160088\">rape crisis centers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/budget-impasse-pennsylvania-interest-easterseals-mental-health-payments-capitol/\">mental health providers</a>,  are also <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/budget-impasse-pennsylvania-interest-easterseals-mental-health-payments-capitol/\">expending reserves, taking out loans and furloughing employees</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Then comes the federal shutdown. </p>\n\n<p>Military families nationwide have been hit particularly hard, with <a href=\"https://time.com/7325261/military-pay-trump-shutdown-food-pantry/\">many turning to food pantries</a> to help meet their needs. The recent money maneuvers at the Department of Defense <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/15/congress/shutdown-troop-pay-oct-31-00608851\">to pay active-duty and activated National Guard and Reserves</a> personnel is temporary. The commonwealth also has the eighth-highest population of federal civilian employees, at <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47716\">over 66,000 who are not being paid</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Services like food banks are <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/politics/2025/10/union-leaders-warn-that-state-budget-impasse-federal-shutdown-could-compound-each-other.html\">especially vulnerable</a> in this situation, as they are seeing greater demand – which may increase due to federal workers going unpaid – but rely on both the state and federal governments for subsidies. Just this week, it was announced that Pennsylvanians buying health care through the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2026 should expect a <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-pennie-insurance-2026-rate-hikes/\">22% increase in premiums</a>, on average. Part of that increase is due to expectations around the expiring Obamacare subsidies at the center of the Democrats’ demands in this shutdown. </p>\n\n<p>All of these forces are coming together to pinch Pennsylvania residents. </p>\n\n<h2>Echoes of the past</h2>\n\n<p>While the compounding pain of the federal shutdown is unique, long budget delays in Pennsylvania are not. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, Gov. Shapiro’s first budget was not fully passed until Dec. 14. That budget was fundamentally delayed by the <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/12/pennsylvania-budget-impasse-legislature-education-home-repair-teacher-stipend-funding/\">acrimonious implosion of a deal on school voucher spending</a> between the governor and Senate Republicans. The budget negotiations ended after some <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/12/pennsylvania-budget-impasse-legislature-education-home-repair-teacher-stipend-funding/\">horse-trading on specific programs</a>, like removing the popular <a href=\"https://dced.pa.gov/download/whole-home-repairs-fact-sheet/?wpdmdl=119745\">Whole-Home Repairs Program</a> started during the COVID-19 pandemic but adding <a href=\"https://dced.pa.gov/newsroom/shapiro-administration-makes-first-ever-investment-of-175-million-to-repair-school-buildings-and-ensure-kids-have-safe-healthy-learning-environments-through-new-initiative/\">funding for lead and asbestos abatement</a> in schools. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between then and now, however, is that back then the governor and General Assembly agreed on the overall budget, but typical bargaining was needed to get the votes needed to pass the spending bills after the voucher blow-up. This time, the parties are <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/budget-pennsylvania-impasse-house-senate-conflict-capitol/\">almost $3 billion apart</a> in what should even be spent.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, however, both Pennsylvania and the federal government will pass budgets, and I expect that each will be the result of protracted negotiations over multiple spending items, as Americans have seen in the past. The question is: How much pain will citizens, nonprofits and local governments face in the interim?</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267382/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Daniel J.

Increasingly, consumers are <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032853/what-does-protein-powder-do/\">using these protein sources daily</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A new study by Consumer Reports, published on Oct. 14, 2025, claims that some such protein products <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?msockid=078a1cc015a3675f3a180ab914aa660b\">contain dangerously high levels of lead</a>, as well as other heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic. At high levels, these substances have serious, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23424-heavy-metal-poisoning-toxicity\">well-documented health risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/\">clinical pharmacologist</a> who has evaluated the heavy metal content of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/parents-can-soon-use-qr-codes-to-reveal-heavy-metal-content-in-baby-food-247579\">baby food</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280211023328\">calcium supplements</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2024.2395552\">kratom products</a>. Lead and other heavy metals <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/epa-has-lowered-the-screening-level-for-lead-in-soil-heres-what-that-could-mean-for-households-across-the-us-224609\">occur naturally in soil and water</a>, so achieving zero-level exposure would be impossible. Additionally, the level of lead exposure that Consumer Reports deems safe is significantly lower than those set by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n\n<p>However, regardless of the safety cutoff, the study does show that a few products are delivering a concerningly high dose of heavy metals per serving.</p>\n\n<h2>How Consumer Reports did the study</h2>\n\n<p>The new study assessed 23 <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?msockid=078a1cc015a3675f3a180ab914aa660b\">powder and ready-to-drink</a> protein products from popular brands by sending three samples of each product to an independent commercial laboratory.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer Reports considered anything over <a href=\"https://article.images.consumerreports.org/image/upload/v1760108748/prod/content/dam/CRO-Images-2025/Special%20Projects/Consumer-Reports-Protein-Powders-and-Shakes-Contain-High-Levels-of-Lead-Methodology-Test-Results.pdf\">0.5 micrograms per day</a> from any single source to be above recommended maximum lead levels. That number comes from the <a href=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/\">California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</a>, which established recommended maximum levels for a variety of substances that could cause cancer or fetal harm. </p>\n\n<p>It is significantly more conservative than the safety standard for lead exposure used by the FDA for drugs and supplements. The discrepancy is driven by Consumer Reports’ aspirational goals of very low exposure versus the more realistic but actionable requirements from the FDA.</p>\n\n<p>According to the FDA, the limit for the amount of lead that a person should consume from any single dietary supplement product <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/98847/download\">is 5 micrograms per day</a>. That number is 10 times higher than the Consumer Report limit. </p>\n\n<p>The FDA has another standard for the total daily amount of lead a person can safely consume from  food, drugs and supplements combined. This number, called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105202\">Interim Reference Level, or IRL, for lead</a> is based on concentrations of lead in the blood that are associated with negative health effects in different populations. </p>\n\n<p>For people who could become pregnant, that level is 8.8 micrograms per day, and for children it’s 2.2 micrograms per day. For everyone else, it’s 12.5 micrograms per day. Every food, drug and dietary supplement that contains lead contributes to the total daily exposure, which should be less than this amount.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Bodybuilder at the gym drinking a protein shake\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In assessing lead levels, Consumer Reports used a more conservative safety standard than the one used by the FDA for drugs and supplements.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/bodybuilder-drinking-or-taking-protein-powder-and-royalty-free-image/1369897745\">lakshmiprasad S/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What the report found</h2>\n\n<p>The nonprofit advocacy group found that 16 of the 23 products it tested exceeded 0.5 micrograms, the level of lead in a standard serving that the organization deems safe.</p>\n\n<p>Four of the 23 products exceeded 2.2 micrograms, the FDA’s cutoff for the total daily amount of lead children should consume. Two products contained 72% and 88%, respectively, of the total daily amount of lead that the FDA deems safe for pregnant women.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Consumer Reports found that two of the 23 products delivered more than what it considers a safe amount of cadmium per serving, and one had more arsenic than was recommended. </p>\n\n<p>The organization’s safety cutoff for cadmium is 4.1 micrograms per day, and for arsenic it is 7 micrograms per day. These numbers align fairly closely with the FDA’s recommended exposure limit for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/98847/download\">cadmium and arsenic from a single product</a>. For cadmium, the FDA’s limit is set at 5 micrograms per day for a given dietary supplement product and 15 micrograms per day for arsenic.</p>\n\n<p>The study found that the source of protein was key: Plant-derived protein products had nine times the lead found in dairy proteins like whey, and twice as much as beef-based protein.</p>\n\n<h2>Where are these heavy metals coming from?</h2>\n\n<p>Lead and other heavy metals are present in high amounts in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10070398\">volcanic rock</a>, which comes from molten rock called magma beneath the Earth’s surface. When volcanic rock is eroded, the heavy metals contaminate the local soil and water supply.

And what can they do?</h2>\n\n<p>Occasionally exceeding the daily recommended heavy metal doses is unlikely to result in serious health issues. </p>\n\n<p>Repeated, heavy exposure to heavy metals can cause harm, however. When they <a href=\"https://www.gethealthspan.com/research/article/heavy-metal-exposure-neurological-health-longevity\">accumulate in the blood, these substances</a> can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.1712\">delay or impair mental functioning</a>, damage nerves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92236-w\">soften bones</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82435-6\">raise blood pressure</a> – which in turn increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Heavy metals can also increase the <a href=\"https://cancerscience.net/knowledgebase/which-cancers-are-linked-to-heavy-metal-exposure\">risk of developing cancer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that all the products Consumer Reports flagged have lead levels significantly lower than the maximum daily exposure levels established by the FDA.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers can limit exposure by choosing dairy- or animal-based sources of protein products, since they generally seemed to have less heavy metal contamination than plant-based ones. However, some plant-based protein products in the study did not have high levels of heavy metals. Heavy metal levels vary <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170972\">widely in the environment</a>, so the results from the Consumer Reports study show a snapshot in time. They might not be consistently accurate across batches if, for example, a manufacturer changes the source of its raw ingredients. </p>\n\n<p>For protein products that do show an especially high heavy metal content, using them more sporadically, rather than daily, can reduce exposure. Studies suggest that <a href=\"https://www.biotech-asia.org/vol17no2/analysis-of-nutrients-heavy-metals-and-microbial-content-in-organic-and-non-organic-agriculture-fields-of-bareilly-region-western-uttar-pradesh-india/\">organic plant-based products</a> generally yield less heavy metal content than traditionally farmed ones. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Consumer Reports study measured heavy metals in a single serving of protein products, so it’s helpful to understand what constitutes a serving for specific products and to avoid sharply increasing daily consumption. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the wide variation in lead levels across different protein powders and ready-made protein products highlights the need for manufacturers to tighten product testing and good manufacturing practices.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267591/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>C.

That may sound like a lot, but the country has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/ewjm.173.5.348\">struggled for decades</a> to train <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/doctor-shortages-have-hobbled-health-care-for-decades-and-the-trend-could-be-worsening-251222\">enough physicians to meet its needs</a> – and, in particular, to provide <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-health-care-is-rife-with-high-costs-and-deep-inequities-and-thats-no-accident-a-public-health-historian-explains-how-the-system-was-shaped-to-serve-profit-and-politicians-256393\">care in rural and underserved communities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Foreign-born physicians have long filled that gap, reducing the overall national shortage and signing up to practice in often overlooked regions and specialties. Today, <a href=\"https://meridian.allenpress.com/jmr/article/111/2/7/507660/FSMB-Census-of-Licensed-Physicians-in-the-United\">1 in 5 doctors licensed to practice in the U.S.</a> were born and trained in another country.</p>\n\n<p>But the ability of physicians from other countries to obtain work in the U.S. may be threatened by the Trump administration’s aims of limiting foreign workers. In September, Trump issued a proclamation requiring employers sponsoring foreign-born workers through a type of work visa called an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\">H-1B to pay a fee of US$100,000</a> to the government. The White House has <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hospital-physician-relationships/white-house-weighs-exemptions-on-hb-1-visa-fees-for-physicians\">signaled doctors may be exempt</a> but has not clarified its position.</p>\n\n<p>As a physician and professor who studies <a href=\"https://olin.washu.edu/faculty/patrick-aguilar\">the intersection of business and medicine</a>, I believe increasing restrictions on H-1B visas for physicians may exacerbate the physician shortage. To grasp why that is, it’s important to understand how foreign-trained doctors became such an integral part of U.S. health care – and the role they play today. </p>\n\n<h2>The roots of today’s physician shortage</h2>\n\n<p>The Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade association representing U.S. medical schools, estimates there will be a <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage\">deficit of about 86,000 physicians</a> in the country by 2036. </p>\n\n<p>The roots of this shortage stretch back more than a century. In 1910, a landmark study called the Flexner Report detailed <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3178858/\">significant inconsistencies in the quality of education</a> at American medical schools. The report resulted in the <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/the-1910-report-that-unintentionally-disadvantaged-minority-doctors/\">closure of over half the country’s medical schools</a>, winnowing their numbers down from 148 to 66 over two decades. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33937\">the number of doctors in the U.S. declined</a> until new training programs emerged. Between 1960 and 1980, <a href=\"https://medicine.hofstra.edu/pdf/about/medicine_doc_macy1009.pdf\">40 new medical schools launched</a> with the help of federal funding. In 1980, a congressionally mandated assessment deemed the problem solved, but by the early 2000s, a physician shortage emerged once more. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges called for <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/us-medical-school-enrollment-surpasses-expansion-goal\">raising medical school enrollment by 30%</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor looking at x-rays\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Foreign-born doctors have helped the U.S. bridge a physician shortage for decades.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/doctor-royalty-free-image/671053838\">stevecoleimages/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Growth in medical school enrollment hit that target in the late 2010s, but even so, the U.S. still lacks <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">enough medical graduates</a> to fill yearslong training programs, called residencies, that early-career physicians must complete to become fully qualified to practice.     </p>\n\n<p>Especially lacking are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4300/JGME-D-24-00591.1\">primary care physicians</a> – particularly in <a href=\"https://www.ruralhealth.us/blogs/2025/06/rural-physician-burnout-and-staffing-shortage-impact-in-2025\">rural areas</a>, where there are <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/about-us/mission-areas/health-care/rethinking-rural-health\">one-third as many physicians per capita</a> as in urban areas. </p>\n\n<h2>Opportunities for foreign-born doctors</h2>\n\n<p>Even as the U.S. built up medical school enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, the government joined other countries such as the U.K. and Canada in creating immigration policies that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1747-5341-3-24\">drew physicians from developing countries</a> to practice in underserved areas. Between 1970 and 1980, <a href=\"https://www.phg.com/2000/01/physician-statistics-summary/\">their numbers grew sharply</a>, from 57,000 to 97,000. </p>\n\n<p>Foreign-born and -trained physicians have remained a key pillar of the U.S. medical system. In recent years, the <a href=\"https://www.intealth.org/pdfs/EVSP-Physicians-Country-2024.pdf\">majority of those physicians</a> have come from India and Pakistan. Citizens of Canada and Middle Eastern countries have added significantly to that count, as well. Most arrive in the U.S. as trainees in residency programs through one of <a href=\"https://www.practicelink.com/resource-center/physician-immigration-visa/j1-vs-h1b-visa-for-medical-residency/\">two main visa programs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The majority come on J-1 visas, which allow physicians to enter the U.S. for training but require them to return to their home country for at least two years when their training is complete. Those who wish to remain in the U.S. to practice <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/america-is-increasingly-dependent-on-foreign-doctors-but-their-path-to-immigration-is-getting-harder-229980\">must transition to an H-1B visa</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A small percentage of physicians come to the U.S. on H-1Bs from the start.</p>\n\n<p>H-1B visas are employer-sponsored temporary work permits that <a href=\"https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/the-h-1b-visa-explained\">allow foreign-born, highly skilled workers</a> to obtain U.S. employment. Employers directly petition the government on behalf of visa applicants, certifying that a foreign worker will be paid a similar wage to U.S. workers and will not adversely affect the working conditions of Americans. </p>\n\n<p>Several programs sponsor H-1B visas for physicians, though the most common requires a <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/conrad-30-waiver-program\">three-year commitment to work in an underserved</a> area after completing their training. </p>\n\n<h2>Foreign physicians fill a crucial need</h2>\n\n<p>In 2025, foreign-trained medical graduates filled <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">9,700 of the nearly 40,000 training positions</a>. Of those, roughly one-third were actually U.S. citizens who attended medical schools in other countries, with the remainder being foreign citizens seeking more training in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>After residency, these doctors frequently practice in precisely the geographic areas where the <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bureau-health-workforce/state-of-the-primary-care-workforce-report-2024.pdf\">physician shortage is most severe</a>. A nationwide survey of international medical graduates found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1915548\">two-thirds practice in regions</a> that the federal government has designated as <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/workforce-shortage-areas/shortage-designation\">lacking sufficient access to health care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These doctors also occupy a disproportionate number of primary care positions. In a sample of 15,000 physicians who accepted new jobs in one year, foreign-born doctors were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09123-9\">nine times more likely to enter primary care</a> specialties. In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">33.3% of internal medicine</a>, 20.4% of pediatric and 17.6% of family medicine training positions were filled by physicians trained in other countries.</p>\n\n<h2>Who will pay?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/aha-ama-warn-steep-visa-fee-will-exacerbate-clinician-shortages-hit-underserved-areas\">Approximately 8,000 foreign-born physicians</a> received H-1B visas in 2024. The new requirement of a $100,000 sponsorship fee would hit hardest for hospitals, health systems and clinics in areas of the country most significantly affected by the physician shortage.  </p>\n\n<p>These organizations are already under economic strain due to <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/press-releases/2025-04-30-new-aha-report-hospitals-and-health-systems-squeezed-persistent-economic-challenges\">increasing labor costs and Medicare payments</a> that have not kept pace with inflation. Dozens of these hospitals have <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/10-things-to-know-about-rural-hospitals/\">closed in recent years</a>, and many currently do not make enough money to support their operations. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 25, 2025, 57 physician organizations cosigned a letter petitioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/education/international-medical-education/waiving-100000-h-1b-fee-imgs-serves-national-interest\">waive the new application fee for physicians</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Already, however, the new rule may be having a chilling effect. Despite years of annual growth in the number of foreign-born applicants to U.S. physician training programs, 2025 has seen a <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/publication/eras-statistics\">nearly 10% drop</a>. If the new H-1B fee is applied to physicians, the number is likely to keep falling.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266544/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Patrick Aguilar Washington University, an employer of physicians. </span></em></p>",

A special class of oxidants, free radicals, are <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652#how-do-free-radicals-damage-the-body\">even more reactive and dangerous</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://campus.und.edu/directory/nathaniel.johnson.4\">assistant professor of nutrition</a>, I’ve studied the long-standing research showing how the imbalances in antioxidants and oxidants lead to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress\">oxidative stress</a>, which is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_862_16\">linked to cancer</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb45080420\">diabetes</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9090864\">cardiovascular disease</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-2009-1041\">dementia and Alzheimer’s disease</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030552\">a primary cause of aging</a> is the damage accumulated across of a lifetime of oxidative stress. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put: To help prevent oxidative stress, people need to eat foods with antioxidants and limit their exposure to oxidants, particularly free radicals. </p>\n\n<h2>The research: Food, not supplements</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no way for any of us to avoid some oxidative stress. Just metabolism – the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21893-metabolism\">processes in your body</a> that keep you alive, such as breathing, digestion and maintaining body temperature – are a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac4765\">source of oxidants and free radicals</a>. \n<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21660-inflammation\">Inflammation</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101621\">pollution</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S94374\">radiation</a> are other sources. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, everyone needs antioxidants. There are many different types: <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21532-enzymes\">enzymes</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/definitions/mineralsdefinitions.html#\">minerals</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002399.htm#:%7E\">vitamins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/what-are-phytochemicals-and-why-should-you-eat-more-them\">phytochemicals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Two types of phytochemicals deserve special mention: <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids\">carotenoids</a> and <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-flavonoids-everything-you-need-to-know\">flavonoids</a>. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids\">Carotenoids</a> are pigments, with the colors yellow, orange and red; they contain the antioxidants <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/252758\">beta-carotene</a>, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-lycopene\">lycopene</a> and <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=19&amp;contentid=Lutein#\">lutein</a>. Some <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-flavonoids-everything-you-need-to-know\">flavonoids</a>, called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/16546628.2017.1361779\">anthocyanins</a>, are pigments that give foods a blue, red or purple color. </p>\n\n<p>Although your body <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-antioxidants#\">produces some of these antioxidants</a>, you can get them from the foods you eat, and they’re better for you than supplements. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, researchers found that antioxidant supplements <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.600\">did not reduce deaths</a>, and some supplements in excessive amounts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.20471/acc.2019.58.04.20\">contribute to oxidative stress</a>, and may even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.297.8.842\">increase the risk of dying</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It should be pointed out that in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.297.8.842\">most of these studies</a>, only one or two antioxidants were given, and often in amounts far greater than the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t2/?report=objectonly\">recommended daily value</a>. One study, for example, gave participants only vitamin A, and at an amount <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/21.6.435\">more than 60 times an adult’s recommended intake</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqQLpXQqMGo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A synopsis of the study that measured the antioxidant content of more than 3,000 foods.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Foods rich in antioxidants</h2>\n\n<p>In contrast, increased antioxidant intake from whole foods is related to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-21748-x\">decreased risk of death</a>. And although antioxidant supplementation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/62.6.1427S\">didn’t reduce cancer rates in smokers</a>, the antioxidants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwh173\">in whole foods did</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But measuring antioxidants in foods is complicated. Extensive <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073380\">laboratory testing is required</a>, and too many foods exist to test them all anyway. Even individual food items that are the same exact variety of food – such as two Gala apples – can have different amounts of antioxidants. Where the food <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5142/jgr.2013.37.355\">was grown and harvested</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fochx.2022.100334\">how it was processed</a> and how it was stored during <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.685\">transportation and while in the supermarket</a> are factors. The variety of the food also matters – the many different types of apples, for instance, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/jf047832r\">can have different amounts of antioxidants</a>.   </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, in 2018, researchers quantified the antioxidant content <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-9-3\">of more than 3,100 foods</a> – the first antioxidant database. Each food’s antioxidant capacity was determined by the amount of oxidants neutralized by a given amount of food. The researchers measured this capacity in millimoles per 100 grams, or about 4 ounces.</p>\n\n<p>For fruits easily found in the grocery store, the database shows blueberries have the most antioxidants – just over 9 millimoles per 4 ounces. The same serving of pomegranates and blackberries each have about 6.5 millimoles. </p>\n\n<p>For common vegetables, cooked artichoke has 4.54 millimoles per 4 ounces; red kale, 4.09 millimoles; cooked red cabbage, 2.15; and orange bell pepper, 1.94. </p>\n\n<p>Coffee has 2.5 millimoles per 4 ounces; green tea has 1.5; whole walnuts, just over 13; whole pecans, about 9.7; and sunflower seeds, just over 5. Herbs and spices <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox6030070\">have a lot</a>: clove has 465 millimoles per 4 ounces; rosemary has 67; and thyme, about 64. But keep in mind that those enormous numbers are based on a quarter-pound. Still, just a normal sprinkle <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox6030070\">packs a powerful nutritional punch</a>.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young woman picks up a package of fresh produce at the supermarket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The antioxidant levels of a food can be affected by its storage time in the supermarket.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-asian-woman-with-shopping-cart-carrying-a-royalty-free-image/1465219564?phrase=foods%20in%20the%20grocery%20store&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">d3sign/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Other tips</h2>\n\n<p>Other ways to choose antioxidant-rich foods: Read the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/truth-in-labeling-act-would-heighten-the-warning-for-shoppers-looking-to-cut-sugar-salt-and-saturated-fat-intake-233856\">nutrition facts label</a> and look for antioxidant vitamins and minerals – vitamins A, C, E, D, B2, B3 and B9, and the minerals selenium, zinc and manganese. </p>\n\n<p>Just know the label has a drawback. Food producers and manufacturers are not required to list every nutrient of the food on the label. In fact, the only vitamins and minerals <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/whats-nutrition-facts-label\">required by law</a> are sodium, potassium, calcium, iron and vitamin D. </p>\n\n<p>Also, focus on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2019.11.001\">eating the rainbow</a>. Colorful foods are often higher in antioxidants, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.01.014\">blue corn</a>. Many darker foods are rich in antioxidants, too, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.109\">dark chocolate</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.790765\">black barley</a> and dark leafy vegetables, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9020097\">such as kale and Swiss chard</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Although heat can degrade oxidants, that mostly occurs during the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.685\">storage and transportation of the food</a>. In some cases, cooking may increase the food’s antioxidant capacity, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3746/pnf.2017.22.3.216\">as with leafy green vegetables</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that while blueberries, red kale and pecans are great, their antioxidant profile will be different than that of other fruits, vegetables and nuts. That’s why diversity is the key: To increase the power of antioxidants, choose a variety of fresh, flavorful, colorful and, ideally, local foods.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256974/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nathaniel Johnson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

When she’d arrived with her mother and two brothers, she’d been horrified. </p>\n\n<p>The detention facility was located in the middle of the desert, about 225 miles northeast of Los Angeles. As I describe in my book “<a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/When-Can-We-Go-Back-to-America/Susan-H-Kamei/9781481401456\">When Can We Go Back to America? Voices of Japanese American Incarceration during World War II</a>,” barbed wire surrounded the perimeter and armed soldiers peered down from guard towers. The toilets and showers lacked partitions, and Nagano was forced to stand in long lines for hours in mess halls that served canned food. Her bed was a metal cot. She was directed to stuff straw into a bag for a makeshift mattress.

Thanks to an effort spearheaded by Kwong, a baseball field on the site has been restored as a way to both celebrate the resiliency of so many prisoners and memorialize this dark period in U.S. history.</p>\n\n<h2>A massive removal effort</h2>\n\n<p>After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Commission_on_Wartime_Relocation_and_Internment_of_Civilians/\">the U.S. government wrongly assumed</a> that Japanese-descended West Coast residents would be more loyal to Japan and presented an espionage risk.</p>\n\n<p>So on Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Executive_Order_9066/\">executive order</a> that gave the U.S. Army the authority to forcibly remove all first-generation immigrants from Japan and their American-born descendants from their West Coast homes.</p>\n\n<p>In March 1942, U.S. soldiers began transporting the detainees to temporary detention sites under Army jurisdiction. The Manzanar site opened on March 21, 1942, and it eventually became one of 10 long-term detention centers, colloquially known as “the camps.” </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.duncanryukenwilliams.com/about\">Duncan Ryȗken Williams</a>, the director of <a href=\"https://ireizo.org/about/\">The Irei Project</a>, which has compiled the most comprehensive list of those detained, nearly 127,000 people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated between 1942 and 1947, when the last camp closed. Two-thirds of them were American citizens. Most were imprisoned for the duration of the war, and all were held without hearings or charges leveled against them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An Asian American boy swings a baseball bat at an approach ball as other boys watch in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sixth-grade boys play softball during recess at the Manzanar Relocation Center on Feb. 10, 1943.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://cdm16855.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16855coll4/id/11431\">Francis Leroy Stewart, courtesy of California State University Dominguez Hills Gerth Archives &amp; Special Collections</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A love of the game</h2>\n\n<p>Adjusting to their new grim reality, the detainees embraced the Japanese spirit of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190319-the-art-of-perseverance-how-gaman-defined-japan\">gaman</a>,” which means to endure hardship with dignity and resilience.

Though Zenimura was forced to leave his Fresno home and go to a camp in <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Gila_River/\">Gila River, Arizona</a>, he soon had a baseball diamond and a 32-team league up and running.</p>\n\n<h2>Patriotism on the diamond</h2>\n\n<p>At Manzanar, baseball was easily <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/manzanar-baseball.htm\">the most popular sport</a>. According to Dave Goto, the Manzanar National Historic Site arborist, the camp had 10 baseball and softball diamonds on the grounds and more than 120 teams divided into 12 leagues. The camp newspaper, the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Manzanar_Free_Press_(newspaper)/\">Manzanar Free Press</a>, provided detailed game recaps, and thousands turned out to watch the games at Manzanar’s “A” Field. </p>\n\n<p>“Watching baseball played at a semi-pro level was entertainment and also gave them a sense of normalcy and community,” Nakagawa said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Sepia toned photograph of Japanese Americans wearing baseball uniforms and posing for a team picture.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The ManzaKnights were one of the 100-plus teams formed at the Manzanar camp.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of the Maruki Family/Manzanar Historic Site</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But for those who felt their loyalty to the U.S. was unfairly questioned, baseball was also a powerful way to express their identity as Americans, especially for the U.S.-born children of Japanese immigrants. Takeo Suo, who was incarcerated at Manazarer, recalled, “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/manzanar-baseball.htm\">Putting on a baseball uniform was like wearing the American flag</a>.” Or, as Nakagawa put it, \n“What could be more American than playing the all-American pastime?” </p>\n\n<p>After the war was over and the camps closed, those who’d been imprisoned had to focus on rebuilding their lives. Many were unable to return to their prewar hometowns. For those who ended up back on the West Coast, baseball continued to play an important role.</p>\n\n<p>As Japanese American journalist and sports historian Chris Komai explained in a <a href=\"https://www.janm.org/events/2024-12-07/manzanar-baseball-project\">program at the Japanese American National Museum</a>, “Baseball was a way for them to reestablish their communities while they <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Resettlement/\">dealt with antagonism and discrimination</a>. Through the games they stayed connected with their friends and relatives who were now scattered.” </p>\n\n<p>Postwar community baseball gave rise to the Southern California Nisei Athletic Union Baseball Leagues and other leagues that still operate. Kwong began playing for the Nisei Athletic Union in 1971 and does so to this day.</p>\n\n<h2>Rebuilding a dusty field of dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Nagano instilled in her son a commitment not only to baseball but also to social justice. A performance artist, Kwong stages a one-man play, “<a href=\"https://www.greatleap.org/performances\">Return of the Samurai Centerfielder</a>,” to shed light on this episode in history through the lens of playing baseball at Manzanar. Two years ago, he set out to restore the main Manzanar ball field and to bring baseball back to the site as a tribute to his late mother and other Manzanar detainees.</p>\n\n<p>Working with Goto, the site arborist, volunteer construction supervisor Chris Siddons, Manzanar archaeologist Jeff Burton and other Manzanar site staff, Kwong and his team have restored the field almost exactly as it was. They carefully scrutinized archival photos, some taken by famed landscape photographer <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/ansel-adams-manzanar/about-this-collection/\">Ansel Adams</a> and others snapped by studio photographer <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Toyo_Miyatake/\">Toyo Miyatake</a>, who’d been imprisoned at Manzanar.

People in these roles serve kids and families across the country. They help them answer questions about how school districts are providing for their children, in the way they are legally required to, if their child has special needs. </p>\n\n<p>Special education is <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/contact-us/faqs/Special%20Education%20and%20Rehabilitative%20Services#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20regulations%2C%20a,provide%20assistance%2C%20organized%20by%20state.\">a very broad category</a>. Under the Department of Education, it encompasses everything from dyslexia to a child who is blind. There is no educational need so severe that a child is not entitled to <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/civil-rights-laws/disability-discrimination/disability-discrimination-key-issues/disability-discrimination-providing-free-appropriate-public-education-fape\">free and adequate education</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When navigating challenges related to your child’s special needs education, you really need an advocate – in the legal sense of the term rather than the political one. You need someone whose job it is to take your call and walk you through options, or just document your call and start an inquiry into your case. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the Office of Special Education Programs do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Office of Special Education Programs is part of the Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which has about 179 employees. The government spent more than <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/subagency/office-of-special-education-and-rehabilitative-services/\">US$20 billion on its work</a> from April 2024 through March 2025, making the broader Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services the third-largest branch of the Education Department, in terms of spending. </p>\n\n<p>There are very strong federal legal obligations – and often state ones, too – for schools to serve kids with whatever need they have. This office’s main job is to be a <a href=\"https://www.parentcenterhub.org/resourcelibrary/index/o/o1/\">resource to parents</a> for their child’s education, particularly if parents feel they are not having these legal obligations met.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say a child with autism is in school. Their parent does not believe the school district is providing the accommodations that their child is legally entitled to. The school district disagrees and thinks the child is doing well in school. When things get fuzzy about what a child’s needs actually are, or parents feel they are being ignored, OSEP can help parents learn what their options are, and then can even become involved and serve as an arbitrator to figure out the best course of action.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, public school districts and state departments of education have very clear, accessible ways for parents to receive information about their rights and obtain instructions for putting together an <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/iepguide.pdf\">individualized education plan</a> for their child. If those rights are not met, states may open an investigation into the matter to ensure compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this process, parents may seek support and guidance from OSEP to make sure state investigations into special education cases are being done and being done well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What could these investigations result in?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Department of Education can help hold states and districts accountable and push districts and schools to be more responsive. In the best-case scenario, additional or tailored programming and support – whether it is a teacher’s aide or something else – can come from an OSEP investigation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An older white woman wears a cream suit and sits at a table, with two men on either side of her.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, center, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Aug. 26, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/secretary-of-education-linda-mcmahon-alongside-epa-news-photo/2231526601?adppopup=true\">Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>What does your research show about the impact of cutting services like these?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Well, we don’t really know what happens when you gut OSEP because no one has tried to gut OSEP before. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s safe to say that parents will get really frustrated.

In the long run, this may actually make parents even worse off because those sectors have <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-94\">have no obligation at all to serve students with special needs</a>. So what’s happening at the U.S. Department of Education right now is not only creating more dissatisfaction and distrust in the system as it stands, but it’s also going to leave parents and kids with fewer options to get the support they need.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267684/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Josh Cowen ran for Congress as a Democrat prior to ending his campaign and returning to research and teaching during the fall of 2025.</span></em></p>",

The AI-generated civics lesson plans we analyzed also left out opportunities for students to explore the stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized people.</p>\n\n<p>The allure of generative AI as a teaching aid has caught the attention of educators. A Gallup survey from September 2025 found that <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/659819/k-12-teacher-research.aspx\">60% of K-12 teachers are already using AI in their work</a>, with the most common reported use being teaching preparation and lesson planning.  </p>\n\n<p>Without the assistance of AI, teachers might spend hours every week crafting lessons for their students. With AI, <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/survey-teachers-work-more-hours-week-other-working-adults\">time-stretched</a> teachers can generate detailed lesson plans featuring learning objectives, materials, activities, assessments, extension activities and homework tasks in a matter of seconds. </p>\n\n<p>However, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot were not originally built with educators in mind. Instead, these tools were trained on huge amounts of text and media drawn largely from across the internet and then launched as general-purpose chatbots. </p>\n\n<p>As we started using these tools in our practice as educators, we noticed they often produced instructional materials and lessons that echoed the “recite and recall” model of traditional schooling. This model can be effective for memorizing basic facts, but it often fails to engage students in the active learning required to become informed citizens. We wondered whether teachers should be using these general-purpose chatbots to prepare for class.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://citejournal.org/proofing/civic-education-in-the-age-of-ai-should-we-trust-ai-generated-lesson-plans/\">For our research</a>, we began collecting and analyzing AI-generated lesson plans to get a sense of what kinds of instructional plans and materials these tools provide to teachers. We decided to focus on AI-generated lesson plans for civics education because it is essential for students to learn productive ways to participate in the U.S. political system and engage with their communities.</p>\n\n<p>To collect data for this study, in August 2024 we prompted three GenAI chatbots – the GPT-4o model of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model and Microsoft’s latest Copilot model – to generate two sets of lesson plans for eighth grade civics classes based on Massachusetts state standards. One was a standard lesson plan and the other a highly interactive lesson plan. </p>\n\n<p>We garnered a dataset of 311 AI-generated lesson plans, featuring a total of 2,230 activities for civic education. We analyzed the dataset using two frameworks designed to assess educational material: Bloom’s taxonomy and Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://teaching.cornell.edu/resource/blooms-taxonomy\">Bloom’s taxonomy</a> is a widely used educational framework that distinguishes between “lower-order” thinking skills, including remembering, understanding and applying, and “higher-order” thinking skills – analyzing, evaluating and creating. Using this framework to analyze the data, we found 90% of the activities promoted only a basic level of thinking for students. Students were encouraged to learn civics through memorizing, reciting, summarizing and applying information, rather than through analyzing and evaluating information, investigating civic issues or engaging in civic action projects. </p>\n\n<p>When examining the lesson plans using <a href=\"https://www.teachingforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Banks_James.pdf\">Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content model</a>, which was developed in the 1990s, we found that the AI-generated civics lessons featured a rather narrow view of history – often leaving out the experiences of women, Black Americans, Latinos and Latinas, Asian and Pacific Islanders, disabled individuals and other groups that have long been overlooked. Only 6% of the lessons included multicultural content. These lessons also tended to focus on heroes and holidays rather than deeper explorations of understanding civics through multiple perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, we found the AI-generated lesson plans to be decidedly boring, traditional and uninspiring. If civics teachers used these AI-generated lesson plans as is, students would miss out on active, engaged learning opportunities to build their understanding of democracy and what it means to be a citizen. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Teachers can try to customize lesson plans to their situation through prompts, but ultimately generative AI tools do not consider any actual students or real classroom settings the way a teacher can.</p>\n\n<p>Although designed to seem <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/17/business/ai-text-detection.html\">as if they understand users</a> and be in dialogue with them, from a technical perspective chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/large-language-models-how-the-ai-behind-the-likes-of-chatgpt-actually-works-244701\">machines that predict the next word in a sequence based on massive amounts of ingested text</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When teachers choose to use these tools while preparing to teach, they risk relying on technology not designed to enhance, aid or improve teaching and learning. Instead, we see these tools producing step-by-step, one-size-fits-all solutions, when what’s needed in education is the opposite – flexibility, personalization and student-centered learning. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"jVfrq\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jVfrq/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>While our study revealed that AI-generated lesson plans are lacking in many areas, this does not mean that teachers should not use these tools to prepare for class. A teacher could use generative AI technologies to advance their thinking. In the AI-generated lesson plans we analyzed, there were occasional interesting activities and stimulating ideas, especially within the homework suggestions. We would recommend that teachers use these tools to augment their lesson-planning process rather than automate it.</p>\n\n<p>By understanding AI tools cannot think or understand context, teachers can change the way they interact with these tools. Rather than writing simple, short requests – “Design a lesson plan for the Constitutional Convention” – they could write detailed prompts that include contextual information, along with proven frameworks, models and teaching methods. A better prompt would be: “Design a lesson plan for the Constitutional Convention for 8th grade students in Massachusetts that features at least three activities at the evaluate or create level of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Make sure to incorporate hidden histories and untold stories as well as civic engagement activities at the social action level of Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content model.” </p>\n\n<p>Our study emphasizes the need for teachers to be critical users, rather than quick adopters, of AI-generated lessons. AI is not an all-in-one solution designed to address the needs of teachers and students. Ultimately, more research and teacher professional development opportunities are needed to explore whether or how AI might improve teaching and learning.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265355/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That’s because it could curb their rights to report information not authorized by the government for release.</p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/920380090/Pentagon-Media-Memo-Full\">initial policy change announced on Sept. 20</a>, 2025 – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">and later revised</a> – forbade journalists from publishing anything that hadn’t been approved by government officials. It gave journalists 10 days to sign and agree to the restrictions. A refusal to sign could have resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">cancellation of their press credentials</a> to enter the Pentagon.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.bellisario.psu.edu/people/individual/amy-kristin-sanders\">a First Amendment expert</a>, I believe the Pentagon policy change represents an unprecedented development in the Trump administration’s offensive against the press and a historic departure from previous administrations’ policies. </p>\n\n<p>Attacks on journalism, said once-imprisoned journalist Peter Greste, “are a national security issue, and we have to protect press freedom.” Greste spoke in early October 2025 at the Global Free Speech Summit in Nashville, Tennessee, adding that “anything that undermines press freedom undermines national security.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/01/joy-release-peter-greste-egypt\">Greste was jailed for more than a year</a> in Egypt while working for Al Jazeera in 2013. In Nashville, he drew a direct connection between the public’s access to information under a free press and the stability and freedom that democracies enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Even President Donald Trump seemed critical of the policy initially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/trump-pentagon-journalists\">telling a reporter</a> in September 2025 he didn’t think the Pentagon should be in charge of deciding what reporters can cover. </p>\n\n<h2>An attempt to control critical coverage</h2>\n\n<p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/920380090/Pentagon-Media-Memo-Full\">initial Pentagon policy change</a>, journalists covering the Defense Department were required to sign a contract saying that department information must be “approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.”</p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQsMOxILtlw\">told Fox News</a> on Oct. 5, “The Pentagon press corps can squeal all they want, we’re taking these things seriously. They can report, they just need to make sure they’re following rules.”</p>\n\n<p>Media outlets decided they could not accept the policy change. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/media/pentagon-hegseth-press-reporter-rules\">They also mulled legal action</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">Pentagon revised its initial policy change</a> on Oct. 6 and set an Oct. 14 deadline for journalists to comply. The revised policy says prior approval would not be required to report on the Defense Department, but it suggests that <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/news/pentagon-doubles-down-pete-hegseth-muzzling-reporters-press-corps-policy.php\">soliciting information from Pentagon sources</a> “would not be considered protected activity under the 1st Amendment.” But journalists who don’t sign and follow <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">the revised policy</a> could be deemed “security risks” and lose their credentials to access the Pentagon.</p>\n\n<p>As the Oct. 14 deadline approached, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/five-major-broadcast-networks-say-will-not-sign-new-pentagon-press-pol-rcna237526\">dozens of media outlets</a> said they would not sign the revised policy. Fox, Newsmax and the Daily Caller – all conservative news organizations – have also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/media/pentagon-press-hegseth-restrictions-journalists-fox\">rejected the policy</a>. The following day, journalists from dozens of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/15/business/media/pentatgon-press-rules.html\">news outlets turned in their press passes</a> rather than agree to the new policy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26183464-ppa-statementdocx-1/\">The Pentagon Press Association</a>, which represents journalists covering the Defense Department, says the revised policy is “asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding’ of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.”</p>\n\n<p>Conservative commentators have also criticized the policy. Law professor <a href=\"https://www.law.gwu.edu/jonathan-turley\">Jonathan Turley</a> <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/pentagons-new-press-rules-may-bridge-too-far-turley-warns\">told Fox News</a>: “What they’re basically saying is if you publish anything that’s not in the press release, is not the official statement of the Pentagon, you could be held responsible under this policy. That is going to create a stranglehold on the free press, and the cost is too great.”</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time Hegseth has sought to limit media coverage of the Pentagon. In May 2025 <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1926020350191567308\">he restricted journalists’ access</a> to large portions of the Pentagon where they’d previously been allowed to go unescorted. </p>\n\n<h2>Freedom from government control</h2>\n\n<p>It is not unusual for the government to view the <a href=\"https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2386&amp;context=hastings_law_journal\">press as an adversary</a>. But such direct attempts to control media outlets have been rare in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government has rarely been successful in its efforts to censor the media. In the 1930s, the Supreme Court set a high bar for the government to overcome if it wanted to stop the presses.</p>\n\n<p>As Chief Justice Charles Hughes wrote in 1930 in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/283/697/\">Near v. Minnesota</a>: “The fact that, for approximately one hundred and fifty years, there has been almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints upon publications relating to the malfeasance of public officers is significant of the deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional right.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit and tie speaks in front of a lecturn.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a news conference at the Pentagon on June 22, 2025, in Arlington, Va.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-speaks-during-a-news-news-photo/2220718203?adppopup=true\">Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the years since, the high court has reiterated its belief that an adversarial press is essential to democracy. At the height of the Vietnam War, the court ruled the government could not prevent The New York Times from <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/new-york-times-co-v-united-states-the-pentagon-papers-case\">publishing leaked documents detailing U.S involvement</a> in the conflict, despite the sensitive nature of the documents. </p>\n\n<p>President Richard Nixon’s own nominee, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/justices/warren_e_burger\">Chief Justice Warren Burger</a>, recognized the danger of allowing the <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">government to restrict freedom of the press</a>. “The thread running through all these cases is that prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights. … The damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the communication of news and commentary on current events,” Burger wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Burger acknowledged the role the press plays as a watchdog against the government’s abuse of power in 1976 in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart</a>. “The press … guards against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting the (legal system) to extensive public scrutiny and criticism.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether the Supreme Court’s commitment to these long-standing precedents remains steadfast is anyone’s guess. </p>\n\n<p>Law scholars <a href=\"https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u6007959\">RonNell Andersen Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.law.uga.edu/profile/sonja-r-west\">Sonja West</a> have <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6865&amp;context=nclr\">documented</a> a marked decline in references by the high court to press freedom over the past two decades. They have also noted a dramatic change in the justices’ tone when discussing the press: </p>\n\n<p>“(A)ny assumption that the Court is poised to be the branch to defend the press against disparagement is misplaced … When members of the press turn to the Court in their legal battles, they will no longer find an institution that consistently values their role in our democracy,” <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6865&amp;context=nclr\">Andersen Jones and West write</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">Burger was aware</a> that muzzling the press posed serious consequences for a democratic society: “(I)t is nonetheless clear that the barriers to prior restraint remain high unless we are to abandon what the Court has said for nearly a quarter of our national existence and implied throughout all of it. The history of even wartime suspension of categorical guarantees, such as habeas corpus or the right to trial by civilian courts cautions against suspending explicit guarantees,” Burger wrote in his opinion in Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart in 1976.</p>\n\n<p>The new Pentagon policy, however, does just that by threatening reporters who write critical stories with the loss of their press credentials.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266129/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Amy Kristin Sanders has served as an expert witness for Fox News.

Ironically, it was the same elite military unit that helped bring <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/who-is-madagascars-fleeing-president-andry-rajoelina-2025-10-14/\">Andry Rajoelina</a>, former mayor of the capital Antananarivo, to power in a <a href=\"https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/afdr/2009/af/122835.htm\">March 2009</a> coup that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/africa/madagascar-protests-soldiers-attempted-coup-intl\">now supported anti-government protesters</a> and ultimately forced the president to flee.</p>\n\n<p>I lead a research team that compiles the <a href=\"https://www.johnjchin.com/colpus\">Colpus Dataset</a> of coup types and characteristics and <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/historical-dictionary-of-modern-coups-d%C3%A9tat-9781538120675/\">have written on the history of coups d’état</a> from 1946 through 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Our data suggests that even as coups have declined globally overall, <a href=\"https://development.oneearthfuture.org/en/one-earth-future/news/annual-risk-coup-report-2019\">coup risk</a> remains comparatively high in Africa. Since 2020, the continent has now seen 10 successful coups across eight countries.</p>\n\n<p>But the military takeover in Madagascar marks only the second coup in that period to take place outside of the <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1080/00396338.2025.2508086\">Sahel region</a>, stretching from the Atlantic to the Horn of Africa – a signal that Africa’s coup problem is becoming a continental one.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"T0zpz\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T0zpz/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>But why do some coups succeed and others fail? And why do Madagascar and various states in Africa have trouble escaping so-called <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:49097086-8505-4eb2-8174-314ce1aa3ebb\">coup traps</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Our data provides some answers. But first it is worth exploring what we mean when we use the term coup.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a coup?</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqab058\">coup d’état</a> is a seizure of executive power involving one or more concrete, observable and illegal actions by security personnel or civilian officials. </p>\n\n<p>Here, Madagascar’s military takeover appears to qualify. Despite claims by the country’s new military leader, Col. Michael Randrianirina, that he had an order from the High Constitutional Court legitimizing his seizure of power, this seemed to be <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/madagascar-protests-coup-leader-d589bfacc33bfd7e7e53bfadef7c6d8b\">contradicted by statements a day earlier</a> that Randrianirina’s military council had suspended the high court’s powers.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that every political event that smells like a coup is, in fact, a coup. </p>\n\n<p>Many coup plots never come to fruition. A bona fide plot may be preempted and the plotters arrested, or plotters may abandon their plan before taking any concrete action. Moreover, sometimes a leader <a href=\"https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2020/06/16/when-are-coups-fake-news/\">falsely alleges a coup plot</a> to purge members of the government suspected of disloyalty. </p>\n\n<p>A plot without an attempt to oust the leader is not, in our book, a coup.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, attempts to target a leader without a plan to seize power are not coups. This includes <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140211024287\">leader assassination attempts</a> by political opponents or lone wolves or <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140211024287\">mutinies by disgruntled soldiers</a> who might even march on the presidential palace to demand higher pay, promotions or other policy concessions.</p>\n\n<p>Nor do most civilian-led mass uprisings entail coups, even if they are successful in toppling the government. Take Nepal, where in September a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo\">Gen Z-led protest</a> turned violent and ousted the government. But there was no coup insofar as the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nepal-gen-z-protests-army-kathmandu-2e4d9e835216b11fa238d7bcf8915cbf\">military remained quartered</a> rather than actively joining the protests or issuing a threat to compel the prime minister to resign. </p>\n\n<p>However, some revolutions and coups do co-occur, resulting in a “<a href=\"https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/restoring-democracy-lessons-from-bolivia-since-the-2019-coupvolution/\">coupvolution</a>” or “<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095327X19881747\">endgame coup</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Determining whether a coup accompanies anti-government protests depends on how elites and the military behave, not on how violent protesters may be.</p>\n\n<p>In Madagascar, mostly peaceful civilian protests turned into a coup attempt once troops actively joined the demonstrations. That attempt succeeded when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ne96gx1do\">Randrianirina</a>, commander of the elite CAPSAT force, claimed the interim presidency and insisted a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/madagascar-protests-rajoelina-ab1e1eb1aca45fe7e80e81314ebdb0c6\">military council would rule</a> for the time being.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vFnfA\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vFnfA/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Why do coups succeed?</h2>\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.johnjchin.com/colpus\">601 coup attempts since 1946</a>, according to our database, with 299 being successful – or about 50%. In Africa during that period, 111 out of 225 coup attempts were successful.</p>\n\n<p>Coups come in a variety of forms, with <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/4/1040/6312785?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">different causes and outcomes</a>, and not all are equally likely to succeed. The events in Madagascar, however, tick many of the boxes associated with determining coup success.</p>\n\n<p>Coups <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/10989/seizing-power\">depend on coordinating</a> a lot of people, while simultaneously preventing the leader from finding out about the plot. Mass protests of the kind that rocked Madagascar in recent weeks <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1017/s0022381613001485\">provide cover</a> – as well as <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002716654742\">motive and opportunity</a> – for coup plotters.</p>\n\n<p>Counterintuitively, military force is rarely decisive. In a typical coup attempt, much of the military remains neutral, biding its time to see whether the leader or coupists will prevail. Consequently, the perceived momentum of events influences how the military rank and file react: If they think the coupmakers will succeed, they typically join; if they think the coup will fail, they generally oppose it. </p>\n\n<p>A coup’s momentum depends on a variety of factors, including the identity, location and <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674737266\">strategy of coup leaders</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002716685611\">domestic and international reactions</a> to the coup. </p>\n\n<p>Coups that are launched by government insiders and senior military officers in the capital and are nonviolent and result in pro-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to succeed. By contrast, coups that are launched by government outsiders and junior officers outside the capital and are bloody and generate fierce anti-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Coup violence is inversely correlated with success. When no force is threatened – usually because the security forces remain united under a senior command – coups succeed 85% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, less than 40% of coups that escalate into civil-war levels of violence – that is, resulting in over 1,000 fatalities – succeed.</p>\n\n<p>In Madagascar, we saw the involvement of government elites and senior officers in the capital, mass pro-coup mobilization, low levels of coup violence and a history of prior successful coups – all of which make coup success likely. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A crowd of protesters.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Coup supporters cheer police officers in Gabon in August 2023.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GabonCoup/a1ead7837aac41c4bc0f579eebe2bc85/photo\">AP Photo/Betiness Mackosso</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Madagascar is not alone</h2>\n\n<p>Since 2020, military actors have also <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2023.1077945/full\">taken power</a> in coups in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>So why are so many African countries prone to falling into a coup trap? </p>\n\n<p>Scholars have asked this question for decades. Development economist Paul Collier <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:49097086-8505-4eb2-8174-314ce1aa3ebb\">suggests</a> that Africa is the most coup-prone region because it is the poorest region of the world, and it is <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/poverty-the-coup-trap-and-the-seizure-of-executive-power/2D6EC35637250DDD2C5B9F9489A823D8\">poverty</a> and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002713520531\">low growth</a> – and associated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002715603098\">political violence</a> – that drive coups.</p>\n\n<p>Others have pointed to high levels of ethnic diversity, and a history of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/when-soldiers-rebel/58A5BDBF32E67D2C415FAA3826689F14\">ethnic exclusion</a> and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ethnicsoldiersst0000enlo\">ethnic militaries</a>, as long-standing drivers of coups on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>But since 2020, a number of other factors also appear to be driving up structural coup risk on the continent. Many African countries have seen <a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad891-across-africa-public-trust-in-key-institutions-and-leaders-is-weakening/\">declining trust in public institutions and leaders</a> and a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/01/1145852\">rise of terrorist violence</a>, which have generated <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/9/1/season-of-putsch-why-have-coups-become-popular-in-africa\">mass popularity</a> for recent coups on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-coup norms have also <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-fading-of-the-anti-coup-norm/\">weakened in recent years</a>. International pressure to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/coups-and-democracy/505910A86167FE82C8D7019FF6A829AB\">restore civilian rule</a> was quite strong in the 1990s and 2000s, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002716685611\">contributing</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-decline-of-the-african-military-coup/\">decline of African military coups</a>. But new post-coup African governments appear more resilient to sanctions, are <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/sahel/burkina-faso-mali-niger/defining-new-approach-sahels-military-led-states\">cooperating more</a> with each other and are able to draw on the support of authoritarian “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2015.1124089\">patrons</a>,” notably Russia and China.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, African post-coup governments are staying in power longer, which in turn emboldens coup plotters elsewhere who see a more permissive environment. </p>\n\n<p>So even if <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-myth-of-the-coup-contagion/\">there are limits</a> to Africa’s “coup contagion,” Madagascar likely won’t be the last domino to fall, given structural conditions on the continent.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267581/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John Joseph Chin does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In a 200-unit building, parking could add millions of dollars to the developer’s costs. </p>\n\n<p>Parking requirements are often determined by a formula. Based in part on an outdated view that modern cities should be car-oriented, cities around the country, including Denver, <a href=\"https://denver.prelive.opencities.com/files/assets/public/v/1/community-planning-and-development/documents/zoning/denver-zoning-code/archived-versions/2023-03-13_complete_dzc.pdf\">passed zoning codes in the 1950s and 1960s</a> that created legal requirements for the number of parking spaces that new housing projects must include.</p>\n\n<p>Land is expensive in high-demand cities like Denver. Dedicating part of a building’s footprint to parking imposes both a direct cost – because developers must pay to build the parking – and an indirect cost, because it leaves less space for housing.

They included five potential parking policies tested across five economic environments and three sets of assumptions for developer-driven parking inclusion. </p>\n\n<h2>Changes would bring hundreds of housing units</h2>\n\n<p>Our prediction that eliminating parking mandates in Denver could result in approximately 460 additional multifamily units per year is based on three assumptions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Somewhat unfavorable economic conditions, including high interest rates and relatively low margins for developers. </li>\n<li>Elimination of all regulatory parking mandates.</li>\n<li>Voluntary construction of 0.5 spaces per unit near light rail and 1.0 spaces per unit away from light rail.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We find that eliminating parking minimums creates <a href=\"https://www.law.du.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/Examining%20Relationships%20between%20Eliminating%20Parking%20Minimums%20and%20New%20Housing%20Construction%20Using%20a%20Terner%20Housing%20Simulator%20Tool%20-%20August%202025%20r2.pdf\">more options for developers and renters</a>.

Now, it’s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-arrest-miscarriage-fetal-personhood-rcna199400\">headline news in the United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMxj894AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a scholar who studies the relationship between reproductive rights and political regimes</a>, I see the U.S. mirroring a pattern that has happened in authoritarian regimes around the world. When a government erects barriers to comprehensive reproductive care, it doesn’t just <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797896\">cause more death and suffering</a> for women and their families. Such policies are often <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/expanding-abortion-access-strengthens-democracy-while-abortion-bans-signal-broader-repression-worldwide-study-240278\">a first step in the gradual decline of democracies</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, the U.S. is different in a meaningful way. Here, abortion has historically been framed as a personal right to privacy. In many other countries I’ve studied, abortion is viewed more as a collective right that is inextricably tied to broader social and economic issues.</p>\n\n<p>The American individualist perspective on abortion can make it harder for people in the U.S. to understand why banning abortion can serve as a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/ticking-time-bomb-restrictions-on-abortion-rights-and-physical-integrity-rights-abuses/8E033094CB21BB7428E2C4D7AECA6C72\">back door for the erosion of civil liberties – and of democracy itself</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Autocrats target abortion first</h2>\n\n<p>Restricting reproductive rights is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://news.uoregon.edu/content/history-fascism-reproductive-rights-offers-lessons-today\">Benito Mussolini’s Italy</a> in 1926 and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-01-04/stalins-abortion-ban-soviet-union\">Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union</a> in 1936 to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/abortion-rights-in-spain-back-to-past/\">Francisco Franco’s Spain</a> in 1941 and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/09/15/romania-exposes-how-abortion-bans-kill-women-rip-society-apart/\">Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania</a> in 1966, the first move most 20th-century dictators made after seizing power was to criminalize abortion and contraception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, for some of those autocratic leaders, limiting access to abortion and contraception was a strategy to gain the approval of the nation’s religious leaders. The Catholic Church held great power in Italy and Spain, as did <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09668130500051924\">the Orthodox Church</a> in Romania. At the time, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00002.x\">these faiths opposed artificial birth control</a> and still believe life begins at conception.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on reproductive rights <a href=\"https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1936-2/abolition-of-legal-abortion/\">also aimed</a> to <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/01/13/inenglish/1421140333_379388.html\">increase</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0738399195008519\">birth rates</a> following two world wars that had stamped out some of the population, particularly in the Soviet Union and Italy. Many political leaders saw <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789509\">procreation as a national duty</a>. They designated women – white, heterosexual women, that is – specific roles, primarily as mothers, to produce babies as well as future soldiers and workers for their regimes.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, countries in Europe and the Americas have been following this recognizable pattern. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/31/nicaragua-abortion-ban-threatens-health-and-lives\">Nicaragua</a> and <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/un-cedaw-report-poland-abortion/\">Poland</a> have both banned abortion. <a href=\"https://populationmatters.org/news/2025/01/viktor-orbans-hungary-the-erosion-of-reproductive-rights/\">Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/05/legal-yet-virtually-banned-turkish-women-denied-right-to-free-safe-abortions\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/28/russia-limits-womens-access-to-abortion-citing-demographic-changes\">Russia</a> have all clamped down on access to it.</p>\n\n<p>Restricting reproductive freedoms has helped Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stoke lasting political divisions within society that help them consolidate their own power.</p>\n\n<p>These leaders <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2024.102947\">invoke a threat of moral and demographic decline</a>, claiming that child-free women, queer people and immigrants pose a danger to national survival. In doing so, they portray themselves as defenders of their respective nations. It’s a way to regain and retain popular support even as their policies <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/once-prosperous-hungary-is-now-the-poorest-nation-in-eu-meanwhile-this-tiny-nation-tops-the-wealth-rankings/articleshow/121978907.cms?from=mdr\">deepen poverty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/resources/reports/democracy-human-rights-and-rule-of-law-in-russia-making-the-case/\">erode civil liberties</a> and <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2014/corruption-media-and-power-turkey\">increase corruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These politicians have also taken power away from a significant portion of the population by reinstating earlier, fascist-era restrictions on bodily autonomy. As <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/Library/Publications/2020/Discussion-paper-Democratic-backsliding-and-the-backlash-against-womens-rights-en.pdf\">feminist scholars</a> have pointed out, strong reproductive rights are central to functioning democracies.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on reproductive freedoms often necessitate other kinds of restrictions to enforce and maintain them. These might include <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/texass-war-abortion-now-war-free-speech\">free speech limits</a> that prohibit providers from discussing people’s reproductive options. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/13-protesters-arrested-supreme-court-ahead-abortion-pill/story?id=108506592\">Criminalizing political dissent</a> enables the arrest of people who protest restrictions on reproductive freedoms. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/idaho-most-extreme-anti-abortion-state-law-restricts-travel-rcna78225/\">Travel bans</a> threaten prison time for individuals who help young people get abortion care out of state.</p>\n\n<p>When these civil liberties weaken, it becomes harder to defend other rights. Without the right to speak, dissent or move freely, people cannot engage in conversations, organize or voice collective grievances.</p>\n\n<h2>Putting the US in a global context</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/roe-v-wade/\">the U.S.</a> joined the likes of Poland and Hungary when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending 50 years of federal abortion protections.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump was not in power when this happened. Yet the Supreme Court’s conservative majority was shaped during <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/02/06/trump-targets-abortion-state-of-the-union/\">his first term</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-veterans-affairs-abortion-ban\">second Trump administration</a> and many states have enacted <a href=\"https://time.com/7291156/trump-emergency-abortion-guidance/\">their own regulations</a> or bans on abortion. This has created a divided country where in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html\">some states</a> abortion is as restricted as it is under some of the world’s most autocratic regimes.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, there’s a key difference.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., abortion is viewed by the law and the public as a matter of individual rights. The debate often boils down to whether a person should be allowed to terminate their pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>In many other contexts, reproductive rights are understood as a collective good that benefits all society – or, conversely, harms all society when revoked.</p>\n\n<p>This perspective can be a powerful driver of change. It’s how, for example, women’s and feminist groups in places such as <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/historic-vote-argentina-legalize-abortion/\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/colombia-court-decriminalize-abortion/\">Colombia</a> and <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/mexico-supreme-court-decriminalizes-abortion-federal/\">Mexico</a> have successfully pressured their governments to decriminalize abortion in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2018, the movement known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/opinion/abortion-latin-america.html\">Latin America’s Green Wave, or “Marea Verde</a>” for their green protest bandannas, has deliberately and strategically <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/27/1107717283/abortion-rights-green-symbol\">reframed abortion as a human right</a> and used that assertion to expand reproductive rights.</p>\n\n<p>The Latin American <a href=\"https://im-defensoras.org/en/2024/04/resumen-ejecutivo/#los-derechos-que-defendemos\">feminist activists have also documented</a> how restricting abortion intensifies authoritarianism and worsens both individual and collective rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a region where many citizens remember life under military dictatorship, highlighting the relationship between abortion and authoritarianism may be particularly galvanizing.</p>\n\n<h2>Limits of framing abortion as an individual right</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18\">Roe v. Wade in 1973</a> recognized abortion as a private medical decision between “<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/roe-v-wade\">the woman and her responsible physician</a>” up to the point of fetal viability − roughly around 24 to 26 weeks − and that framing has stuck.</p>\n\n<p>This was basically what the mainstream pro-choice movement advocated for at the time. White feminists saw abortion rights <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/pro-choice-movement\">as a personal liberty</a>. This framing has real limitations.</p>\n\n<p>As Black and brown <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/reproductive-justice/paper\">reproductive justice advocates</a> have long pointed out, Roe <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/07/30/fetal-viability-missouri-abortion-amendment/\">never served women of color or poor people particularly well</a> because of underlying unequal access to health care. Their work has, for decades, illustrated the strong connection between racial, economic and reproductive justice, yet abortion is still largely regarded as solely an individual issue.</p>\n\n<p>When debates about reproductive freedoms are framed as fights over individual rights, it can engender a legal quagmire. Other entities with rights emerge – the fetus, for example, or a potential grandparent – and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2012.675046\">are pitted against the pregnant person</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, for instance, a pregnant woman declared brain dead in Georgia <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/05/21/adriana-smith-died-3-months-ago-georgia-could-make-smiths-family-pay-to-use-her-as-a-human-incubator/\">was kept alive for several months</a> until her fetus became viable, apparently to comply with the state’s strict anti-abortion law. As her <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/funeral-plans-adriana-smith-georgia-mom-delivered-baby-life-support-brain-dead/85-d0fce1e8-f37e-4a2f-a043-a64da11c2f13\">mother told the press</a>, her family had no say in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Narrowly focusing on abortion as an individual right can also obscure why banning it has societal impacts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19609407/\">Research worldwide</a> shows that restricting reproductive freedoms <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/05/27/1099739656/do-restrictive-abortion-laws-actually-reduce-abortion-a-global-map-offers-insigh\">does not</a> lead to fewer abortions. Abortion bans only make abortion dangerous as people turn to unregulated “back alley” procedures. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d9z853jndo\">Maternal and infant mortality rates rise</a>, especially in marginalized communities.</p>\n\n<p>Simply stated: More women and babies <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/09/16/infant-mortality-rises-in-states-with-restrictive-abortion-laws-new-research/\">die when abortion and contraception laws become more restrictive</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other kinds of suffering increase, too. Women and their families tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224241292058\">become poorer</a> when contraception and abortion are hard to get.</p>\n\n<p>Abortion bans also lead to discriminatory practices in health care beyond reproductive health services, such as <a href=\"https://phr.org/our-work/resources/cascading-harms-how-abortion-bans-lead-to-discriminatory-care-across-medical-specialties/\">oncology, neurology and cardiology</a>. Physicians who fear criminalization are forced to withhold or alter gold-standard treatments for pregnant patients, for example, or they may prescribe less effective drugs out of concern about legal consequences should patients later become pregnant. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/06/04/what-is-emtala-how-trump-just-overrode-federal-law-on-emergency-abortions/\">Lifesaving procedures</a> in the emergency room must await a negative pregnancy test.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, abortion bans decrease the quality and effectiveness of medical care for many patients, not just those who are pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2>Defending reproductive freedoms for healthy democracies</h2>\n\n<p>These findings demonstrate why reproductive rights are really a collective good. When viewed this way, it illuminates why they are an essential element of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Already, the rollback of reproductive freedoms in the U.S. has been followed by efforts to limit other key areas of freedoms, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5421276/scotus-transgender-kids-decision\">LGBTQ rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.freedomforum.org/free-speech-facing-threats-2025/\">freedom of speech</a> and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-travel-ban-exceptions-immigrants-visa-4d5a4d07a4430dd1e1cf24511370bc0e\">right to travel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Access to safe abortion for pregnant people, gender-affirming care for trans youth, and international travel for noncitizens are intertwined rights – not isolated issues.</p>\n\n<p>When the government starts stripping away any of these rights, I believe it signals serious trouble for democracy.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://tracking.rewirenewsgroup.com/pixel.gif?utm_source=theconversation_com&amp;utm_medium=republished&amp;utm_content=2025-10_abortion-and-authoritarianism\" width=\"100%\" height=\"1\" style=\"height:1px;width:1px;border:0\"></iframe>\n\n<p><em>This story is published in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.rewirenewsgroup.com/\">Rewire News Group</a>, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to covering reproductive and sexual health.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265459/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Seda Saluk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The Department of Energy also <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-625-million-investment-reinvigorate-and-expand-americas-coal\">pledged US$625 million</a> to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants.</p>\n\n<p>However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/deaths-associated-pollution-coal-power-plants\">public health costs</a>. Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/big-beautiful-bill-will-have-americans-paying-higher-prices-for-dirtier-energy-260588\">ending many renewable energy tax credits</a> and pulling federal support for energy research projects.</p>\n\n<p>I work in the <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicylab.org/\">Climate Policy Lab</a> at <a href=\"https://fletcher.tufts.edu/\">The Fletcher School of Tufts University</a>, where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets.

Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025/executive-summary\">dominate global solar panel production</a> and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chinas-electric-vehicle-influence-expands-nearly-everywhere-except-the-us-and-canada-262459\">electric vehicles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/countries-and-regions/brazil/\">Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/countries-and-regions/south-africa/\">South Africa</a>, to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/solar-brics-emerging-economies-now-lead-the-worlds-clean-energy-race/\">Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation</a> in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"DnE3s\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DnE3s/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025/executive-summary\">double by 2030</a>, even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth.</p>\n\n<p>However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/china/coal\">production and emissions from coal</a> continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/chinas-commissioning-coal-power-9-year-high-first-half-report-says-2025-08-25/\">21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants</a>, with projections of over 80 GW for the full year. This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-china-will-phase-down-coal-consumption-over-2026-2030-2021-04-22/\">phase down its coal use</a> between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"zVSIr\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zVSIr/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.</p>\n\n<h2>Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources</h2>\n\n<p>The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/russias-war-on-ukraine\">global energy crisis</a> as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/energy/repowereu_en\">broader REPowerEU</a> plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vqYwv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vqYwv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Renewables are now the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025/electricity\">leading source of electric power</a> in the EU, though <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/regions/europe/energy-mix\">natural gas and oil still account for more than half</a> of Europe’s total energy supply.</p>\n\n<p>The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/11/hungary-slovakia-under-pressure-as-us-and-eu-target-russia-with-energy-sanctions\">Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance</a> to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-tells-trump-dropping-russian-energy-destroy-economy-rcna233841\">Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas</a>. Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"hgxiA\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hgxiA/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/global-renewable-energy-investment-reaches-new-record-as-investors-reassess-risks/\">hit a record high in the first half of 2025</a>, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.</p>\n\n<h2>Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks</h2>\n\n<p>In November 2025, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">the Paris Agreement</a> to limit global temperature rise. </p>\n\n<p>The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while <a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/brazil-petrobras-oil-gas-expansion\">expanding oil and gas production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/brazil-environmental-agency-approves-petrobras-emergency-drill-results-foz-do-2025-09-24/\">exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas</a> region, the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake/about-the-global-stocktake/outcome-of-the-first-global-stocktake\">not on track</a> to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiators are expected to debate measures to <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/cop30-calls-on-accelerated-action-to-cut-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuels\">curb methane emissions</a> and support the <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/themes/climate-change/road-to-cop30-five-negotiation-outcomes-that-could-shape-global-finance/\">transition from fossil fuels</a>. But whether the discussions can eventually translate into a concrete global phaseout plan remains to be seen. Without credible plans to actually reduce fossil fuel dependence, the annual climate talks risk becoming another point of geopolitical tension.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266993/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kate Hua-Ke Chi does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

MAPLE’s refusal to cooperate was the first of many obstacles I faced as I continued my experiment for the next year and a half. During this time, I learned a lot about the building blocks of personality – as well as the challenges of doing scientific research and how to work around them.</p>\n\n<h2>Animals have personalities</h2>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JZNtXVEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">an evolutionary biologist</a> who studies animal behavior, I’m fascinated that no two individuals are completely alike. Think about the animal friends in your life — cats and <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/11/what-shapes-your-dogs-personality/\">dogs have unique personalities</a> and idiosyncrasies, whether it’s a specific food they hate or a particular way they like to nap.</p>\n\n<p>All animals – from the smallest worm to the biggest whale – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2012.62.6.4\">have personalities</a>: individual behavioral preferences that remain more or less stable throughout their lifetime. In <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, the fruit flies I worked with, individuality is evident <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64988\">in simple binary behaviors</a>.

For instance, certain combinations of genes can lead individual fruit flies to have widely different <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12813\">temperature preferences</a>, with some liking colder temperatures and others preferring it warm. These genes determine how wide the range of temperatures an individual’s preferences are drawn from.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists have found genes that influence variation in traits in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2156-13-63\">many animals and plants</a>, so evolution seems to have kept them around for a reason. But what’s the benefit of a gene that makes individuals within a group different from each other?</p>\n\n<h2>The benefits of variation</h2>\n\n<p>An evolutionary theory <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.0176\">called bet-hedging</a> suggests that in an unpredictable environment, having options can be less risky. When conditions are fluctuating, there is no one behavior that is best suited for the environment. Variability-influencing genes can be adaptive in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>Take temperature preference, for example. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine that an organism can have either a low temperature-variability gene, which I will call low-var, or a high temperature-variability gene, high-var. Animals with the low-var gene have similar temperature preferences and can all survive and reproduce when the environment has stable, average temperatures. Comparatively, animals with high-var have very different temperature preferences from each other.</p>\n\n<p>When the environment has average, stable temperatures, the preference of some animals with the high-var gene may be a good fit for conditions. They’ll be able to reproduce, but many other high-var individuals may not.</p>\n\n<p>However, if temperatures fluctuate unpredictably, going below or above the average, all the low-var animals will be unfit and unable to pass on their genes. The low-var population would completely collapse. </p>\n\n<p>In the high-var group, no matter how the environment fluctuates, there would be some individuals whose particular temperature preference makes them able to survive, reproduce and pass on the high-var gene.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Bet-hedging theory explains how a gene increasing variability can be beneficial when the environment fluctuates.

In fluctuating environments, a gene that makes the individuals variable across a certain trait, such as temperature preference, has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.08.005\">a better chance of persisting long term</a>. Populations with these kinds of bet-hedging genes can therefore have a higher chance of surviving in unpredictable environments.</p>\n\n<p>How can evolution shape this variation, and what kinds of genes are involved? To answer this question, I turned to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/selection\">artificial selection</a>. This process is akin to how humans have domesticated plants and animals for millennia. An experimenter screens individuals from a population for a trait of interest, and only those that meet a certain threshold are allowed to reproduce to create the next generation. Instead of nature deciding who survives, the researcher chooses.</p>\n\n<h2>Variability in behavior responds to evolution</h2>\n\n<p>To evolve high variability, I picked a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1500804112\">simple behavior: turn bias</a>. When given a choice to turn left or right in a Y-shaped maze, some flies almost always choose left, others almost always choose right, and others choose left sometimes and right sometimes. These preferences remain stable over their lifetime, and their genetic background plays a role in determining it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a fly is at the top of a white upside-down Y in a circular container\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Which way will the fruit fly go, left or right?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Shraddha Lall</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While the particular turn bias is not inherited – a left-turning mom and a left-turning dad don’t necessarily make left-turning fly babies – the variability in turn bias can be influenced by genes. This potential for variability can be considered the fly’s “personality” – whether that’s a strong preference for one direction or a more flexible approach.</p>\n\n<p>For 21 generations, I used video and a type of AI called computer vision to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224243\">track thousands of flies</a>. I focused on siblings that shared a mother. If a sibling group made very similar turn choices, they likely had low-variability genes. If a group of siblings was mixed in terms of how biased they were for turning left or right, it was likely their lineage had a high-variability gene.</p>\n\n<p>The next step was the artificial selection. I’d choose the families most likely to have the high-variability genes to mate and produce the next generation. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4EAa3yIJRU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Computer vision can track individual flies in mazes and record their movements.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>At the end of my experiment, I had evolved populations with very high levels of turn-bias variability. My results showed that variability in traits and increased individuality in behaviors can evolve in response to selection, definitely in the lab and potentially also in nature.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I’m working on figuring out what happened to their genes as the flies evolved, and how their bodies and brains might have changed when I forced them onto this evolutionary path. </p>\n\n<h2>Creating a world where bet-hedging dominates</h2>\n\n<p>I now knew that increased behavioral individuality can evolve. That is, flies can evolve differing personalities driven by selection. Could I recreate in the lab the environmental conditions that would lead to this evolution in nature?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.245751\">Fruit flies are ectotherms</a>, meaning they need to get heat from external sources. Their temperature preference ensures that they find a suitable environment to live and lay eggs in. In a world with increasing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58544-5\">unpredictability in temperatures</a>, bet-hedging strategies may evolve as animals adapt.</p>\n\n<p>Based on bet-hedging theory, I hypothesized that evolving in an unpredictable thermal environment in the lab, with temperatures fluctuating over generations, would lead to the evolution of higher variability in temperature preferences.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, a labmate and I began creating houses for flies where we could control temperatures of different areas and change them over time. Unfortunately, time and logistics stopped this experiment, and it sits in storage now. I hope to continue this work someday.</p>\n\n<p>My fly experiments taught me a lot about how animal behavior evolves, and also a lot about the process of doing research. There have been two constants – first, sometimes things don’t work out, and that’s OK. And second, regardless of the challenges – including broken robots, long hours and paused experiments – I want to keep exploring how evolution can shape personality as animals adapt to changing environments.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261615/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shraddha Lall was affiliated with The Conversation U.S. as a AAAS Mass Media Science Fellow for summer 2025. </span></em></p>",

This medical device has been around <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28171\">for over 200 years</a> and remains a staple in the clinic despite significant advances in medical diagnostics and technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The stethoscope is a medical instrument used to listen to and amplify the internal sounds produced by the body. Physicians still use the sounds they hear through stethoscopes as initial indicators of heart or lung diseases. For example, a heart murmur or crackling lungs often signify an issue is present. Although there have been significant advances in imaging and monitoring technologies, the stethoscope remains a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa343\">quick, accessible and cost-effective tool</a> for assessing a patient’s health. </p>\n\n<p>Though stethoscopes remain useful today, audible symptoms of disease often <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911365\">appear only at later stages of illness</a>. At that point, treatments are less likely to work and outcomes are often poor. This is especially the case for heart disease, where changes in heart sounds are not always clearly defined and may be difficult to hear.</p>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9sHVoAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">are scientists</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nzq4Ci8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and engineers</a> who are exploring ways to use heart sounds to detect disease earlier and more accurately. Our research suggests that combining stethoscopes with artificial intelligence could help doctors be less reliant on the human ear to diagnose heart disease, leading to more timely and effective treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>History of the stethoscope</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201605-411PS\">invention of the stethoscope</a> is widely credited to the 19th-century French physician René Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec. Before the stethoscope, physicians often placed their ear directly on a patient’s chest to listen for abnormalities in breathing and heart sounds. </p>\n\n<p>In 1816, a young girl showing symptoms of heart disease sought consultation with Laënnec. Placing his ear on her chest, however, was considered socially inappropriate. Inspired by children transmitting sounds through a long wooden stick, he instead rolled a sheet of paper to listen to her heart. He was surprised by the sudden clarity of the heart sounds, and the first stethoscope was born. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Wooden tube with writing wrapped around one side\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One of René Laënnec’s original wooden stethoscopes.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co90986/\">Science Museum London/Science and Society Picture Library</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Over the next couple of decades, researchers modified the shape of this early stethoscope to improve its comfort, portability and sound transmission. This includes the addition of a thin, flat membrane called a diaphragm that vibrates and amplifies sound.</p>\n\n<p>The next major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1850s, when Irish physician Arthur Leared and American physician George Philip Cammann developed stethoscopes that could transmit sounds to both ears.

Sometimes, different diseases produce the same abnormal sound. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK345/\">systolic murmur</a> – an extra sound between first and second heart sounds – may be heard with narrowing of either the aortic or pulmonary valve. Yet the very same murmur can also appear when the heart is structurally normal and healthy. This overlap makes it challenging to diagnose disease based solely on the presence of murmurs.</p>\n\n<h2>Teaching AI to hear what people can’t</h2>\n\n<p>AI technology can identify the hidden differences in the sounds of healthy and damaged hearts and use them to diagnose disease before traditional acoustic changes like murmurs even appear. Instead of relying on the presence of extra or abnormal sounds to diagnose disease, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.13535\">AI can detect differences in sound</a> that are too faint or subtle for the human ear to detect. </p>\n\n<p>To build these algorithms, researchers record heart sounds using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s135882\">digital stethoscopes</a>. These stethoscopes convert sound into electronic signals that can be amplified, stored and analyzed using computers. Researchers can then label which sounds are normal or abnormal to train an algorithm to recognize patterns in the sounds it can then use to predict whether new sounds are normal or abnormal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor holding stethoscope to patient's chest\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stethoscopes can capture diagnostic information the human ear alone cannot hear.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/healthcare-professional-listening-to-elderly-womans-royalty-free-image/2232288705\">Drs Producoes/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Researchers are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.036882\">developing algorithms that can analyze</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.019905\">digitally recorded heart sounds</a> in combination with digital stethoscopes as a low-cost, noninvasive and accessible tool to screen for heart disease. However, a lot of these algorithms are built on datasets of moderate-to-severe heart disease. Because it is difficult to find patients at early stages of disease, prior to when symptoms begin to show, the algorithms don’t have much information on what hearts in the earliest stages of disease sound like.</p>\n\n<p>To bridge this gap, our team is using animal models to teach the algorithms to analyze heart sounds to find early signs of disease. After training the algorithms on these sounds, we assess its accuracy by comparing it with image scans of calcium buildup in the heart. Our research suggests that an AI-based algorithm can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.809301\">classify healthy heart sounds</a> correctly over 95% of the time and can even differentiate between types of heart disease with nearly 85% accuracy. Most importantly, our algorithm is able to detect early stages of disease, before cardiac murmurs or structural changes appear.</p>\n\n<p>We believe teaching AI to hear what humans can’t could transform how doctors diagnose and respond to heart disease.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267373/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Valentina Dargam receives funding from Florida Heart Research Foundation and National Institute of Health. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Hutcheson receives funding from the Florida Heart Research Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p>",

And because he is Puerto Rican, <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/jones-shafroth-act\">he’s a U.S. citizen, too</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, Bad Bunny checks many boxes that irk conservatives. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/superstar-bad-bunny-backs-harris-for-president-after-trump-event-features-comedians-racist-cracks\">He endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024</a>. There’s his <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/bad-bunny-outfits-best-looks-red-carpet\">gender-bending wardrobe</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/delos/story/2025-06-18/bad-bunny-calls-ice-agents-sons-of-b-as-they-continue-conducting-raids-in-puerto-rico\">slammed the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies</a>. He has <a href=\"https://people.com/bad-bunny-left-us-out-world-tour-fear-ice-raids-11808001\">declined to tour on the U.S. mainland</a>, fearing that some of his fans could be targeted and deported by ICE. And his <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/bad-bunny-scapegoat-guest-column-8484776/\">explicit lyrics</a> – most of which are in Spanish – would make even the most ardent free speech warrior cringe. </p>\n\n<p>And yet, as experts on <a href=\"https://law.fiu.edu/about/directory/profiles/ediberto-roman.html\">issues of national identity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.libarts.colostate.edu/people/esagas/\">U.S. immigration policies</a>, we think Lahren’s and Johnson’s insults get at the heart of why the rapper has created such a firestorm on the right. The spectacle of a Spanish-speaking rapper performing during the <a href=\"https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/super-bowl-lviii-is-most-watched-telecast-in-history/\">most-watched sporting event on American TV</a> is a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s efforts to paper over the country’s diversity.    </p>\n\n<h2>The Puerto Rican colony</h2>\n\n<p>Bad Bunny was born in 1994 in Puerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory that the country <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3699714\">acquired after the 1898 Spanish-American War</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It is home to <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/puerto-rico-population/\">3.2 million U.S. citizens</a> by birth. If it were a state, it would be the 30th largest by population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. </p>\n\n<p>But Puerto Rico is not a state; it is a colony from a bygone era of U.S. overseas imperial expansion. Puerto Ricans do not have voting representatives in Congress, and they do not get to help elect the president of the United States. <a href=\"https://puertoricoreport.com/poll-of-puerto-rico-voters-shows-statehood-popular-possible-misunderstandings-on-u-s-citizenship/\">They are also divided over the island’s future</a>.

Puerto Rico may belong to the U.S. – and many Puerto Ricans embrace that special relationship – but the island itself does not sound or feel like the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>The over <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/us-hispanics-facts-on-puerto-rican-origin-latinos/\">5.8 million Puerto Ricans that reside in the 50 states</a> further complicate that picture. While legally they are U.S. citizens, mainstream Americans often don’t see Puerto Ricans that way. In fact, a 2017 poll found that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/upshot/nearly-half-of-americans-dont-know-people-in-puerto-ricoans-are-fellow-citizens.html\">only 54% of Americans</a> knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. </p>\n\n<h2>The alien-citizen paradox</h2>\n\n<p>Puerto Ricans exist in what we describe as the “<a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/faculty_publications/317/\">alien-citizen paradox</a>”: They are U.S. citizens, but only those residing in the mainland enjoy all the rights of citizenship. </p>\n\n<p>A recent congressional report stated that U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans “is not equal, permanent, irrevocable citizenship protected by the 14th Amendment … and <a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/faculty_publications/317/\">Congress retains the right to determine the disposition of the territory</a>.” Any U.S. citizen that moves to Puerto Rico no longer possesses the full rights of U.S. citizens of the mainland. </p>\n\n<p>Bad Bunny’s selection for the Super Bowl halftime show illustrates this paradox. In addition to criticisms from public figures, there were <a href=\"https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/maga-call-bad-bunny-deportation-1434541\">widespread calls among MAGA influencers to deport the rapper</a> </p>\n\n<p>This is but one way Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latino citizens, are reminded of their status as “others.” </p>\n\n<p>ICE apprehensions of people merely <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-born-citizen-sues-after-arrested-immigration-agents/story?id=126129734\">appearing to be an immigrant</a> – a tactic that was recently <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a169_5h25.pdf\">given the blessing of the Supreme Court</a> – is an example of their alienlike status. </p>\n\n<p>And the bulk of the ICE raids have occurred in predominantly Latino communities in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQorZkydOR8\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/show/newshour/\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/immigration-enforcement-nyc-trump-administration/\">New York</a>. This has forced many Latino communities to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1u3pG3RHWM\">cancel Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Bad Bunny’s global reach</h2>\n\n<p>The xenophobic fervor against Bad Bunny has led political leaders like <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5544018-bad-bunny-super-bowl-mike-johnson/\">House Speaker Mike Johnson</a> to call for a more suitable figure for the Super Bowl, such as country music artist Lee Greenwood. Referring to Bad Bunny, Johnson said “it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.”</p>\n\n<p>But the facts counter that claim. The Puerto Rican artist sits <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/07/10/how-bad-bunny-leapt-to-the-top-of-the-global-music-charts\">atop the global music charts</a>. He has <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">over 80 million monthly Spotify listeners</a>. And he has sold nearly <a href=\"https://chartmasters.org/bad-bunny-albums-and-songs-sales/\">five times</a> more albums than <a href=\"https://leegreenwood.com/lee-greenwood-honored-with-25-million-albums-sold-worldwide-plaque-at-grand-ole-opry/\">Greenwood</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That global appeal has impressed the NFL, which hopes to host as many as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/21/g-s1-38443/latinos-growing-fanbase-nfl\">eight international games next season</a>. Additionally, Latinos represent the league’s fastest-growing fan base, and Mexico is its largest international market, with a reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/21/g-s1-38443/latinos-growing-fanbase-nfl\">39.5 million fans</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Bad Bunny Super Bowl saga may actually become an important political moment.

This is despite growing availability of a <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep\">highly effective HIV prevention medication</a> that has made it possible to live a long, healthy life with this once fatal disease.</p>\n\n<p>This medication – called <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis\">preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP</a> – reduces the risk of HIV transmission by over 99% when taken as prescribed. Yet, in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, one of the most vulnerable populations – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/half-of-black-gay-men-will-be-diagnosed-with-hiv-despite-highly-effective-preventive-treatments-why-236992\">Black men who have sex with men</a> – are rarely using it, with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08914-2\">fewer than 1 in 5</a> who are eligible taking the drug. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-27/trump-hiv-cuts-restored-funding-surpasses\">previously frozen</a> <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/the-week-in-brief-trump-hiv-funding-cuts/\">and proposed more cuts</a> to HIV prevention programs in the U.S. And although the administration has restored some of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5288113/cdc-website-health-data-trump\">federal webpages and datasets it took down</a> in January 2025, it is unclear what information remains missing or has changed. Communities in the South that already face the highest burden of infection will feel the greatest effects of changing public health priorities.</p>\n\n<p>In my work as a <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/bmnabors.php\">public health researcher</a>, I have spent years studying HIV prevention and the social determinants of health in the Deep South. Through interviews with health care providers and Black patients in major Southern cities, what I learned was that a powerful clash between culture and public health plays a significant role in why effective medical treatments are still failing to reach those who need it most. I call this tension the <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/central/docview/3097997926/CA453CB5E2874464PQ\">Southern paradox</a> – where medical solutions exist but systemic forces block access.</p>\n\n<p>The stories of these clinicians and patients in the South weren’t simply about a pill: They were about trust, identity, family and faith. And their words highlighted a complex web of emotions and experiences that often go unaddressed in standard health messaging.</p>\n\n<h2>Southern culture and sexual health</h2>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/central/docview/3097997926/CA453CB5E2874464PQ\">recent study</a>, I interviewed 12 people in Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta: eight Black <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/men-who-have-sex-with-men-originated-during-the-hiv-pandemic-to-focus-on-behavior-rather-than-identity-but-not-everyone-thinks-the-term-helps-189619\">men who have sex with men</a>, along with four health care providers. Three of these providers also identified as men who have sex with men.</p>\n\n<p>Many participants reported that physical access to PrEP wasn’t the issue. Instead, what stood in the way was far more personal and deeply embedded in their environment.</p>\n\n<p>“In church, you’re taught to love your neighbor, but there’s always an asterisk when it comes to who you love,” one participant from Jackson told me. “If you’re gay, you’re either ignored or silently judged.”</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all participants described the South as a place deeply <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.7\">shaped by conservative values</a>, especially those rooted in religion and traditional family structures. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-the-black-churchs-diversity-and-its-vital-role-in-american-political-history-197511\">Black church</a> emerged as both a protective factor and a challenge. While offering vital community support, it also often reinforced stigma around homosexuality and discouraged open conversations about sexual health.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOSN1bKG3zQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Tackling HIV in the South takes a village.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One participant from New Orleans shared that he heard about PrEP from his health care provider and his friends, while another from Atlanta recalled learning about PrEP during his annual physical. Despite repeatedly being exposed to information about PrEP, both described hesitation about starting treatment. One worried about potential stigma if others discovered he was taking it, while the other questioned whether he “really needed” it. Ultimately, neither had started PrEP.</p>\n\n<p>In many of these communities, sex education in schools is still focused on abstinence and often excludes LGBTQ+ topics entirely. “You grow up not hearing anything about gay sex or HIV,” one man from Memphis said. “So, when you get older, it’s like starting from scratch.”</p>\n\n<p>Even decisions around condom use were heavily shaped by cultural norms. Men described relying on partner trust, age or perceived cleanliness rather than <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/basics-hiv-prevention\">research-based ways to reduce the risk of HIV</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This absence of <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education\">comprehensive, inclusive sex education</a> leaves many vulnerable to misinformation and, ultimately, to preventable infections.</p>\n\n<h2>Trust is the real barrier</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most striking findings from these conversations was the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/many-black-americans-arent-rushing-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-a-long-history-of-medical-abuse-suggests-why-152368\">deep mistrust</a> that many Black men who have sex with men feel toward the health care system. </p>\n\n<p>“It’s hard to find affirming care for people in the queer community,” said one Memphis-based health provider. Others talked about fears of being “outed” through their insurance, especially if they were still on a family health plan.</p>\n\n<p>A Jackson-based participant confided, “Some people avoid taking [PrEP] because for each prescription you are required to be evaluated. Some people don’t want the follow-up or the screening.” Another noted how fear of both outright and subtle <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/heteronormativity-in-health-care-is-harmful-for-lgbtq-patients-and-a-source-of-tension-for-queer-and-trans-doctors-200503\">judgment during medical appointments</a> made it easier to avoid health care altogether.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Patient greeting a person working at a clinic with open arms\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A welcoming health care environment can make all the difference.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/after-missing-recent-appointments-due-to-family-emergencies-news-photo/1186383780\">Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Systemic racism compounds these concerns. For many Black men, historical and ongoing <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/do-implicit-bias-trainings-on-race-improve-health-care-not-yet-but-incorporating-the-latest-science-can-help-hospitals-treat-all-patients-equitably-226289\">experiences of discrimination</a>, including rushed visits, lack of empathy, misdiagnoses and even being denied care altogether have built a lasting sense of caution.</p>\n\n<p>Even when resources like PrEP are available, these treatments often feel inaccessible to Black men because they do not trust the system offering them.</p>\n\n<h2>Social networks step in</h2>\n\n<p>Thankfully, these conversations also uncovered moments of hope. </p>\n\n<p>Many participants learned about PrEP from peers. “We talk about it regularly,” said one participant in Jackson. “I have friends who work in public health, along with friends who are taking the medication.”</p>\n\n<p>In the South, where community ties often serve as critical safety nets, these social networks can sometimes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-016-1413-y\">provide more trusted health information</a> than clinics or campaigns. Informal conversations in group chats, at house parties or during community gatherings often serve as powerful platforms for health promotion. </p>\n\n<p>One provider in Atlanta said he intentionally shared his own experiences with PrEP to reduce stigma. “I have a little soreness,” he said with a smile, referring to a recent injection. “Then I tell everyone, ‘Yup, I just got mine.’ The casualness of that comment made a difference: It made PrEP feel normal, relatable, something for ‘us,’ not something done to ‘them.’”</p>\n\n<p>These social exchanges, rooted in trust and shared experience, frequently did more to shift attitudes than traditional public health campaigns. As one participant put it, “I trust my friends more than those ads. If they’re taking it and it works for them, that means something to me.”</p>\n\n<h2>Making PrEP culturally relevant</h2>\n\n<p>What these conversations show is that for PrEP to work in the South, access to treatment is only part of the equation. Building trust, cultural affirmation and community-led education are equally critical.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mpox-aids-and-covid-19-show-the-challenges-of-targeting-public-health-messaging-to-specific-groups-without-causing-stigma-188328\">Public health messages</a> that go beyond medical facts and address the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of health are more likely to build lasting engagement with HIV prevention. This includes investing in Black, LGBTQ+-affirming health care providers who <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/minority-patients-benefit-from-having-minority-doctors-but-thats-a-hard-match-to-make-130504\">reflect the communities they serve</a>. It also means integrating discussions of sexual health into everyday conversations at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/barbershop-talks-a-safe-place-to-discuss-black-masculinity-99985\">barbershops</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-churches-be-protectors-of-public-health-176949\">churches</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-more-public-libraries-are-doubling-as-food-distribution-hubs-160674\">community centers</a>, not just in clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Public health officials and clinicians can explore alternative treatment delivery methods that address privacy concerns, such as telehealth PrEP programs, discreet mail-order services and community-based distribution points. These can make PrEP easier to access and reduce the stigma associated with clinic visits.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, valuing the knowledge already circulating within communities and supporting peer educators as legitimate public health messengers can strengthen credibility, normalize PrEP and empower people to take charge of their health.</p>\n\n<p>In the battle against HIV in the South, culture is not just a barrier. It can also be the solution. I believe that when care is offered in a way that honors people’s identities, experiences and values, it becomes not just accessible but empowering.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257434/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brandon Nabors does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Suddenly, a horde of ragged, bloodied creatures appear, their feet shuffling along the pavement, their hollow eyes locked on fleeing figures ahead.</p>\n\n<p>A classic movie monster, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20131025-zombie-nation\">the zombie surged in popularity</a> in the 21st century during a time of global anxiety – the Great Recession, the specter of climate change, the lingering trauma of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The zombie apocalypse became a way for people to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137276506_9\">explore the terrifying concept of societal collapse</a>, a step removed from real threats such as nuclear war or global financial disaster.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://fairbanks.indianapolis.iu.edu/about/directory/duszynski-thomas.html\">public health epidemiologist</a> and an amateur zombie historian, I couldn’t help but notice the striking parallels between what epidemiologists do to stop infectious disease outbreaks and what horror movie heroes do to stop zombies. The key questions posed in any zombie narrative – how did this start, how many are infected, how to contain it – are the identical questions that epidemiologists ask during a real infectious disease outbreak or pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>In 2011, in fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a <a href=\"https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/12125\">zombie apocalypse preparedness guide</a> that explained how readying oneself for a zombie apocalypse can prepare people for any large-scale disaster. The zombie is more than just a monster; it is a powerful, public health teaching tool.</p>\n\n<h2>Zombies in ancient history</h2>\n\n<p>The idea of the reanimated dead has been part of human history for millennia, showing up across cultures and long before <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-1108-7_3\">modern germ theory or epidemiology existed</a>. These creatures were often a way for societies to understand and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1905.ad1905\">explain the natural world and disease transmission</a> in the absence of scientific knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2018.1441216\">oldest written reference</a> to creatures similar to modern zombies is found in “<a href=\"https://uruk-warka.dk/Gilgamish/The%20Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh.pdf\">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>,” which was etched on stone tablets sometime between 2000 and 1100 B.C.E. Enraged after Gilgamesh rejects her marriage proposal, the goddess Ishtar tells him, “I shall bring up the dead to consume the living, I shall the make the dead outnumber the living.” This ancient terror – the dead overwhelming the living – has a direct parallel to the concept of an out-of-control epidemic in which the sick quickly overwhelm the healthy. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066129256/\">Hollywood has readily adopted this concept</a> in many zombie movies. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A screenshot for the trailer of Night of the Living Dead\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The creatures in George Romero’s 1968 classic ‘The Night of the Living Dead’ were the first flesh-eating zombies in Hollywood.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Night_Of_The_Living_Dead_trailer_screenshot.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The origins of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/3-things-i-learned-from-teaching-students-about-horror-pioneer-george-romeros-movies-during-these-scary-times-148614\">flesh-eating corpse on screen</a> date back to George Romero’s 1968 classic “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/\">The Night of the Living Dead</a>.” You won’t hear the word “zombie” in Romero’s film, however – in the script, <a href=\"https://assets.scriptslug.com/live/pdf/scripts/night-of-the-living-dead-1968.pdf\">he called the creatures</a> “flesh eaters.” Similarly, in Danny Boyle’s 2002 film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/\">28 Days Later</a>,” the terrifying creatures were called the “infected.” Both these terms, “flesh eaters” and “infected,” <a href=\"https://mymythstories.com/zombies-origin/\">directly echo public health concerns</a> – specifically, the spread of disease via a bacteria or virus and the need for quarantine to contain the afflicted. </p>\n\n<p>The roots of the word zombie arefor the Haitian variety. thought to stretch back to West Africa and to words such as “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786459117\">nzambi,” which means “creator” in African Kongo</a>, or “<a href=\"https://vodouinhaiti.wordpress.com/zonbi/\">ndzumbi,” which means “corpse” in the Mitsogo language</a> of Gabon. However, it was in Haitian Vodou, <a href=\"https://sites.udel.edu/movingfictions/the-books/american-street/vodou-2/\">a religion that draws from the West African spiritual traditions</a> among people who were enslaved on Haiti’s plantations, that the concept took its <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30875163/\">most terrifying form</a>. </p>\n\n<p>According to Vodou, when a person experiences an unnatural, early death, priests can capture and co-opt their soul.

To become a zombie – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html\">dead yet still a slave</a> – was the ultimate nightmare.

Many tales about these eerie creatures don’t just convey how to avoid becoming one of them, but also detail how to stop or prevent them from taking over.

The jiangshi were <a href=\"https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Jiangshi\">corpses suffering from rigor mortis and decomposition</a>, reanimated when a soul couldn’t leave after a violent death. Instead of staggering, these mythological creatures would hop, and their method of attack was to steal a person’s lifeforce, or qi. </p>\n\n<p>Fear of a lonely, restless afterlife led families who lost a loved one far from home <a href=\"https://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/article/the-hopping-dead-the-corpse-walkers-of-china/\">to hire a Taoist priest to retrieve the body</a> for proper burial with ancestors. </p>\n\n<p>In Scandinavia, the draugr – meaning “again walker” or “ghost” – <a href=\"https://thewickedgriffin.com/draugr-norse-mythology/\">was a creature bent on revenge</a>. According to lore, draugrs typically emerged from mean-spirited people or improperly buried corpses. Like zombies, they could turn regular people into draugrs by infecting them. They would attack their victims by devouring flesh, drinking blood or driving victims insane. Draugrs’ contagious nature is a model for disease transmission. What’s more, their seasonal activity – they most often appear at night in winter months –  is similar to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3604842/\">seasonal trends in infectious disease transmission</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white drawing of a giant monster hovering over a house at night\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The draugr’s ability to ‘infect’ people can be seen as an example of disease transmission.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_draugr_by_Kim_Diaz_Holm_(cropped).jpg\">Kim Diaz Holm</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In medieval times, meanwhile, legend had it that creatures called revenants – corpses that came out of their graves – stalked northern and western Europe. According to 12th-century English historian William of Newburgh, these creatures <a href=\"https://historycollection.com/dealing-undead-five-supposed-vampire-graves-around-world/\">emerged from the lingering life force</a> of people who had committed evil deeds during their lives or who experienced a sudden death. Clerics <a href=\"https://repository.wellesley.edu/_flysystem/fedora/2024-06/wctc_2024_patiencelunasylvia_godandcarrion_access.pdf\">fueled people’s fears of becoming a revenant</a> by claiming these creatures were created by Satan. The recommended but gruesome prevention method for this fate was to <a href=\"https://historycollection.com/dealing-undead-five-supposed-vampire-graves-around-world/\">capture and dismember these creatures</a> and to burn the body parts, especially the head.</p>\n\n<p>Archaeological evidence from a medieval village in England suggests that communities heeded this advice. Archaeologists excavated the village’s burial grounds, and among human remains from the 11th to 13th centuries they found <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/news/archaeological-evidence-living-dead-in-mediaeval-england/\">broken and burned bones with knife marks</a>. They show how a community may have taken extreme measures to control a perceived contagion or threat to public safety, mirroring a modern-day quarantine or eradication protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most striking similarity between these historical monsters and Hollywood zombies is that so many of them are created by an infectious agent of some kind. After an outbreak occurs, control is difficult to regain, underscoring the necessity of a rapid public health response.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tom Duszynski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That transfers the risk to a new resident, leaving the community still facing future costly risks.</p>\n\n<h2>FEMA’s buyout program at risk</h2>\n\n<p>Government buyout programs can help communities recover after disasters by purchasing high-risk homes and demolishing them. The parcel is then converted to a natural flood plain, park or site for new infrastructure to mitigate future flood damage for nearby areas. </p>\n\n<p>FEMA has been funding such efforts for decades through its <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN11911\">property buyout program</a>. It has invested nearly US$4 billion to purchase and raze approximately 45,000 flood-prone homes nationwide, most of them since 2001.</p>\n\n<p>Those investments pay off: Research shows the program avoids an estimated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2020.100246\">$4 to $6 in future disaster recovery spending for every $1 invested</a>.

And, when zoomed in, they reveal the buyout locations and destinations of more than 70,000 residents who moved following FEMA-funded buyouts in their area.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A map shows buyouts in cities scattered across the country.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">FEMA’s buyout programs have helped homeowners and communities across the U.S., in almost every state.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://rice1.osn.mghpcc.org/crc-ssl/CFAR_MVP/Test/index.html\">James R.

We checked using address-level <a href=\"https://riskfactor.com/\">flood factors</a> from the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit source of flood risk ratings that are now integrated <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/guides/climate-change-housing-impact/flood-risk\">into some online real estate websites</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But many homes in risky areas are still being resold or rented to new residents, leaving communities facing a game of climate roulette. </p>\n\n<p>How long that can continue will vary by neighborhood. Rising insurance costs, intensifying storms and growing awareness of flood risks are already <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/florida-cape-coal-home-prices-3f64a0df\">dampening home sales</a> in some communities − and thus opportunities to simply hand over one’s risk to someone else and move on.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. can create safer communities by expanding federal, state and local voluntary buyout programs. These programs allow communities to reduce future flood damage and collectively plan for safer uses of the vacated lands that emerge. </p>\n\n<p>Giving residents longer periods of time to participate after the damage could also help make the programs more attractive. This would provide property owners more flexibility in deciding when to sell and demolish their property, while still taking risky property off the market rather than handing the risk to new residents.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262211/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James R.

The 2025 one has become bigger than that: It’s turned into a messaging war. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-website-hud-blames-shutdown-on-radical-left-ethics-group-calls-it-blatant-violation-hatch-act/#\">Official government communications</a>, including website banners, out-of-office email replies and autogenerated responses that denounce “Senate Democrats,” “the Radical Left” or “Democrats’ $1.5 trillion wishlist” for closing the government, mark a sharp break from past practice.</p>\n\n<p>These messages are more than rhetorical escalation. Many may violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\">Hatch Act</a>, the 1939 statute that limits partisan political activity by federal employees and agencies. They also represent new tests for how far a White House can push the bounds of campaign-style messaging while also claiming to govern.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1977865492833378337&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>In any democracy, power lies not only in who writes the laws or signs the budgets but in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muz013\">who shapes the story</a>. Communication is not an afterthought or byproduct of governance. It is one of its essential instruments. Political narrative helps citizens understand who’s responsible, who’s acting in good faith and who’s to blame.</p>\n\n<p>The 2025 shutdown has turned that truth into strategy. Federal communication systems – agency websites, automated emails and public information portals – are being used to persuade rather than inform. It’s a move that is both politically risky and legally perilous. </p>\n\n<h2>Serve the public, not a party</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\">Hatch Act</a> was passed during the Great Depression, after years of concern that <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/hatch-act-of-1939/#:%7E:text=Written%20by,taking%20part%20in%20political%20campaigns\">federal agencies were being used improperly as political machines</a>. Its goal was simple: to ensure that public servants worked for the American people, not for the party in power.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, the Hatch Act <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx\">prohibits executive branch federal employees</a> – except for the president and vice president – from <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/10/does-agency-messaging-blaming-democrats-government-shutdown-violate-hatch-act/408597/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">engaging in partisan political activity</a> as part of their official duties or under their official authority. Government workers may not use their positions or public resources to influence elections, coerce individual behavior or engage in political advocacy. </p>\n\n<p>The law requires federal agencies to avoid the partisan fray and focus on serving the public rather than political agendas. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://osc.gov/Documents/Outreach%20and%20Training/Handouts/A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Hatch%20Act%20for%20Federal%20Employees.pdf\">The Office of Special Counsel</a>, which enforces the law, has been clear on this point. “The purpose of the Act,” <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Documents/Outreach%20and%20Training/Handouts/A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Hatch%20Act%20for%20Federal%20Employees.pdf\">says an Office of Special Counsel guide</a> written for federal employees, “is to maintain a federal workforce that is free from partisan political influence or coersion.” Government communication can inform, but it cannot campaign.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An email auto-reply from the Department of Education blaming the shutdown on Democrats.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An auto-reply to an email sent to the press staff at the U.S. Department of Education on Oct. 14, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet the shutdown has already produced multiple potential violations:</p>\n\n<p>• The Department of Education, according to a lawsuit, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">altered employees’ email auto-responses</a> – without consent – to say things like “the Democrats have shut the government down.” Such changes do more than convey impartial information. They compel employees to align themselves with institutionally imposed scripts. </p>\n\n<p>• Likewise, agencies including Health and Human Services and the Small Business Administration reportedly distributed or directed staff to adopt partisan <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/10/does-agency-messaging-blaming-democrats-government-shutdown-violate-hatch-act/408597/\">out-of-office auto-replies assigning blame to Democrats</a>. </p>\n\n<p>• The Department of Housing and Urban Development posted a banner on its official website stating that the “<a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/agency-shutdown-messaging-draws-hatch-act-antideficiency-act-challenges/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Radical Left are going to shut down the government</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Taken individually, each incident might provoke a Hatch Act complaint.

Agencies themselves, even under pressure, stayed neutral. </p>\n\n<p>This time, the administration is using the machinery of government to deliver partisan blame.</p>\n\n<p>The timing and <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-trump-administration-pushes-the-hatch-act-to-its-limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">similarity of messages</a> across departments seems coordinated. Housing and Urban Development posted a banner blaming Democrats the day before the shutdown began. Within hours, <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/agency-shutdown-messaging-draws-hatch-act-antideficiency-act-challenges/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">other agencies followed</a> using nearly identical language. </p>\n\n<p>More troubling are the reported <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">changes to federal employees’ auto-replies without their consent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These missives forced career civil servants, many of them furloughed, to become unwilling messengers for partisan ends. Federal agencies and their workers are supposed to serve everyone, not only those who support the party in power.</p>\n\n<p>And because the watchdogs who could enforce the legal boundary are also sidelined – the Office of Special Counsel is furloughed  – <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">complaints have nowhere to go</a>, at least for now. They simply land in unattended email inboxes.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal challenges and limits</h2>\n\n<p>Whether shutdown communications truly violate the Hatch Act – or related laws – is not yet clear. The <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-trump-administration-pushes-the-hatch-act-to-its-limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">administration could argue</a> that it’s not campaigning but merely explaining why services are suspended. As a <a href=\"https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-frankchurchinstitute/sam-martin/\">scholar of political communication and American democracy</a>, I believe that defense weakens when official messages explicitly assign partisan blame or name a political party.</p>\n\n<p>And not every political statement is a Hatch Act violation.

It’s one thing to believe false information, but another to actively stick with something that’s obviously wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Our new research, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggests that some people consider it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2025.2541206\">a “win” to lean in to known falsehoods</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ep1t9nsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We are</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4ogbeIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">social psychologists</a> who study political psychology and how people reason about reality. During the pandemic, we surveyed 5,535 people across eight countries to investigate why people believed COVID-19 misinformation, like false claims that 5G networks cause the virus.</p>\n\n<p>The strongest predictor of whether someone believed in COVID-19-related misinformation and risks related to the vaccine was whether they viewed COVID-19 prevention efforts in terms of symbolic strength and weakness. In other words, this group focused on whether an action would make them appear to fend off or “give in” to untoward influence.</p>\n\n<p>This factor outweighed how people felt about COVID-19 in general, their thinking style and even their political beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Our survey measured it on a scale of how much people agreed with sentences including “Following coronavirus prevention guidelines means you have backed down” and “Continuous coronavirus coverage in the media is a sign we are losing.” Our interpretation is that people who responded positively to these statements would feel they “win” by endorsing misinformation – doing so can show “the enemy” that it will not gain any ground over people’s views.</p>\n\n<h2>When meaning is symbolic, not factual</h2>\n\n<p>Rather than consider issues in light of actual facts, we suggest people with this mindset prioritize being independent from outside influence. It means you can justify espousing pretty much anything – the easier a statement is to disprove, the more of a power move it is to say it, as it symbolizes how far you’re willing to go.</p>\n\n<p>When people think symbolically this way, the literal issue – here, fighting COVID-19 – is secondary to a psychological war over people’s minds. In the minds of those who think they’re engaged in them, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5871/bacad/9780197267493.001.0001\">psychological wars</a> are waged over opinions and attitudes, and are won via control of belief and messaging. The U.S. government at various times has used the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14650045.2017.1342623\">concept of psychological war</a> to try to limit the influence of foreign powers, pushing people to think that literal battles are less important than psychological independence.</p>\n\n<p>By that same token, vaccination, masking or other COVID-19 prevention efforts could be seen as a symbolic risk that could “weaken” one psychologically even if they provide literal physical benefits. If this seems like an extreme stance, it is – the majority of participants in our studies did not hold this mindset. But those who did were especially likely to also believe in misinformation.</p>\n\n<p>In an additional study we ran that focused on attitudes around cryptocurrency, we measured whether people saw crypto investment in terms of signaling independence from traditional finance. These participants, who, like those in our COVID-19 study, prioritized a symbolic show of strength, were more likely to believe in other kinds of misinformation and conspiracies, too, such as that the government is concealing evidence of alien contact.</p>\n\n<p>In all of our studies, this mindset was also strongly associated with authoritarian attitudes, including beliefs that some groups should dominate others and support for autocratic government. These links help explain why strongman leaders often use misinformation symbolically to <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/peter-pomerantsev/nothing-is-true-and-everything-is-possible/9781610396004/?lens=publicaffairs\">impress and control</a> a population.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President Trump speaks into a microphone with various uniformed people behind him\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695730/original/file-20251010-66-wev7ua.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Attempts to debunk misinformation look weak to someone who values a symbolic show of strength, while standing by a disprovable statement seems powerful.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-visits-the-u-s-park-police-anacostia-news-photo/2231375108\">Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why people endorse misinformation</h2>\n\n<p>Our findings highlight the limits of countering misinformation directly, because for some people, literal truth is not the point.</p>\n\n<p>For example, President Donald Trump incorrectly claimed in August 2025 that crime in Washington D.C. was at an all-time high, generating <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/aug/12/donald-trump/washington-dc-homicide-rate-international/\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/politics/violent-crime-dc-fact-check-vis\">fact-checks</a> of his premise and <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/magas-feelings-dont-care-about-your\">think pieces</a> about his dissociation from reality.</p>\n\n<p>But we believe that to someone with a symbolic mindset, debunkers merely demonstrate that they’re the ones reacting, and are therefore weak. The correct information is easily available, but is irrelevant to someone who prioritizes a symbolic show of strength. What matters is signaling one isn’t listening and won’t be swayed.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, for symbolic thinkers, nearly any statement should be justifiable. The more outlandish or easily disproved something is, the more powerful one might seem when standing by it. Being an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edgelord\">edgelord</a> – a contrarian online provocateur – or outright lying can, in their own odd way, appear “authentic.”</p>\n\n<p>Some people may also view their favorite dissembler’s claims as provocative trolling, but, given the link between this mindset and authoritarianism, they want those far-fetched claims acted on anyway. The deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, for example, can be the desired end goal, even if the offered justification is a transparent farce.</p>\n\n<h2>Is this really 5-D chess?</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible that symbolic, but not exactly true, beliefs have some downstream benefit, such as serving as negotiation tactics, loyalty tests, or a fake-it-till-you-make-it long game that somehow, eventually, becomes a reality. Political theorist Murray Edelman, known for his work on <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo5948882.html\">political symbolism</a>, noted that politicians often prefer scoring symbolic points over delivering results – it’s easier. Leaders can offer symbolism when they have little tangible to provide.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265652/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Its availability and price directly affect <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47617\">housing costs and broader economic activity in the building sector</a>. The U.S. imports about <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FO\">40% of the softwood lumber the nation uses each year</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx?publish=1\">more than 80% of that from Canada</a>.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump says that the U.S. has the capacity to meet <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">95% of softwood lumber demand</a> and directed federal officials to update policies and regulatory guidelines to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/\">expand domestic timber harvesting</a> and curb the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">arrival of foreign lumber</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/adjusting-imports-of-timber-lumber-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/\">On Sept. 29, 2025</a>, he announced new tariffs on imported timber and wood products, including an additional 10% tariff on Canadian lumber. Those were added to <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-countervailing\">35% tariffs imposed on Canadian lumber</a> in August. It was the latest phase in a long-standing dispute over the supply of lumber to builders in the U.S., which dates back to the 1980s, when U.S. producers began arguing that Canadian companies were benefiting from unfair subsidies from their government. Starting on Oct. 15, Canadian softwood lumber imports could face <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/blog/2025/09/section-232-tariffs\">tariffs exceeding 45%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As researchers studying the <a href=\"https://utia.tennessee.edu/publications/wp-content/uploads/sites/269/2023/10/W1064.pdf\">forestry sector</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102350\">international trade</a>, we recognize that the U.S. has ample forest resources. But replacing imports with domestic lumber isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p>\n\n<p>There are differences in tree species and quality, and U.S. lumber often comes at a higher cost, even with tariffs on imports. Challenges like limited labor and manufacturing capacity require long-term investments, which temporary tariffs and uncertain trade policies often fail to encourage. In addition, the amount of lumber imported tends to mirror the boom-and-bust cycles of housing construction, a dynamic that tariffs alone are unlikely to change.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"no5Xp\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/no5Xp/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Trump’s moves</h2>\n\n<p>To boost U.S. logging, in March, Trump issued an executive order telling the departments of Interior and Agriculture to ease what he called “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/\">heavy-handed</a>” regulations on timber harvesting. The executive order and a <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/04/04/secretary-rollins-announces-sweeping-reforms-protect-national-forests-and-boost-domestic-timber\">follow-up memo from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins</a> do not spell out specifics, but officials say more details are in the works that will simplify the timber harvesting process, with the goal of boosting <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/04/04/secretary-rollins-announces-sweeping-reforms-protect-national-forests-and-boost-domestic-timber\">domestic timber production by 25%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That same month, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to assess how imports of timber, lumber and related wood products affect <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">U.S. national security</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While that assessment was underway, in July, the Commerce Department published findings from a <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-antidumping-duty\">trade review of 2023 Canadian lumber imports</a>. That inquiry alleged that Canadian companies were selling lumber to the U.S. at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-antidumping-duty\">unfairly low prices</a>, potentially leaving U.S. producers with lower sales or depressed prices. That finding was cited as the basis for the 35% August tariff announcement.</p>\n\n<p>In its national security investigation initiated in March, the Commerce Department concluded that an overreliance on imported wood products means “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/adjusting-imports-of-timber-lumber-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/\">the United States may be unable to meet demands</a> for wood products that are crucial to the national defense and critical infrastructure.” The September tariff announcement is based on those findings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Large piles of cut logs are stacked, with homes visible in the distance.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Canadian timber harvesting continues, despite uncertainty about trade with the U.S.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/wood-boards-are-seen-ready-for-shipment-at-the-c-a-spencer-news-photo/2208902064\">Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Canadian lumber in the US market</h2>\n\n<p>In 1991, the <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/\">U.S. imported 11.5 billion board feet</a> (27 million cubic meters) of Canadian lumber. Those imports rose to a high of 22 billion board feet (52 million cubic meters) by 2005.</p>\n\n<p>But as housing construction declined – especially during the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath\">Great Recession</a> from 2007 to 2009 – imports dropped sharply, to less than 8.4 billion board feet (20 million cubic meters) in 2009. The current volume has not recovered to prerecession levels, rising only to 12 billion board feet (28 million cubic meters) in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The value of Canadian lumber has also fluctuated. Historically, prices for Canadian lumber have <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/\">averaged about US$330 per thousand board feet</a> ($140 per cubic meter). During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46636\">import prices soared</a> to almost $800 per thousand board feet ($340 per cubic meter). But since peaking in 2021 and 2022, prices have dropped significantly to $436 per thousand board feet ($185 per cubic meter) by 2024.</p>\n\n<p>In total, in 2024, the U.S. imported <a href=\"https://dataweb.usitc.gov/trade/search/GenImp/HTS\">more than $11 billion in forest and wood products</a> from Canada. Softwood lumber accounted for almost half of that.</p>\n\n<h2>Lumber and housing</h2>\n\n<p>As personal income rises and populations grow, people seek to build new homes. As new home construction – called “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housingstarts.asp\">housing starts</a>” in economic data – increases, so does demand for softwood lumber to build those homes. And when housing starts slow, so does lumber demand.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, housing starts fell during the Great Recession. They declined from a January 2006 peak of 2.3 million to less than 500,000 in January 2009 – <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST\">a decrease of nearly 80%</a>. In that same period, imports of Canadian lumber <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx?publish=1\">fell by more than 60%</a>. Domestic softwood lumber production <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/F\">fell by more than 40%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Both domestic and imported lumber prices can directly influence the overall cost of building homes, which in turn <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/business/tariffs-lumber-furniture-housing-crisis.html\">affects housing affordability</a>. That said, lumber used for framing usually accounts for <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47617\">less than 10% of the total cost to build a new home</a>. The effects of tariffs on new home construction may be significantly less than other factors, such as <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/prices-home-remodeling-outpaced-inflation-quarter-due-labor-126072222\">rising labor costs</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cvpw_PxKsM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=27\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">There are different kinds of wood commonly used in building lumber.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A matter of choice</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. has a lot of potential lumber available.

The technology promises to make police reports more accurate and comprehensive, as well as save officers time.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.axon.com/products/draft-one\">idea is simple</a>: Take the audio transcript from a body camera worn by a police officer and use the predictive text capabilities of large language models to write a formal police report that could become the basis of a criminal prosecution. Mirroring other fields that have allowed ChatGPT-like systems to write on behalf of people, police can now get an AI assist to automate much dreaded paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The catch is that instead of writing the first draft of your college English paper, this document can determine someone’s liberty in court. An <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/internal-memo-dont-use-ai-for-police-reports-prosecutor-tells-seattle-area-law-enforcement/\">error, omission or hallucination</a> can risk the integrity of a prosecution or, worse, justify a false arrest. While police officers must sign off on the final version, the bulk of the text, structure and formatting is AI-generated. </p>\n\n<h2>Who – or what – wrote it</h2>\n\n<p>Up until October 2025, only <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/%7E2025/bills/static/SB0180.html\">Utah</a> had required that police even admit they were using an AI assistant to draft their reports. On Oct. 10, that changed when California became the second state to require transparent notice that AI was used to draft a police report. </p>\n\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB524\">SB 524 into law</a>, requiring all AI-assisted police reports to be marked as being written with the help of AI. The law also requires law enforcement agencies to maintain an audit trail that identifies the person who used AI to create a report and any video and audio footage used in creating the report. It also requires agencies to retain the first draft created with AI for as long as the official report is retained, and prohibits a draft created with AI from constituting an officer’s official statement.</p>\n\n<p>The law is a significant milestone in the regulation of AI in policing, but its passage also signifies that AI is going to become a major part of the criminal justice system. </p>\n\n<p>If you are sitting behind bars based on a police report, you might have some questions. The first question that Utah and California now answer is “Did AI write this?” Basic transparency that an algorithm helped write an arrest report might seem the minimum a state could do before locking someone up. And, even though leading police technology companies like <a href=\"https://investor.axon.com/2024-04-23-Axon-reimagines-report-writing-with-Draft-One,-a-first-of-its-kind-AI-powered-force-multiplier-for-public-safety\">Axon</a> <a href=\"https://my.axon.com/s/article/Draft-One-Settings?language=en_US\">recommend such disclaimers</a> be included in their reports, they are not required. </p>\n\n<p>Police departments in Lafayette, Indiana and Fort Collins, Colorado, were intentionally <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2025/08/axon-police-ai-draft-one-foia/\">turning off the transparency defaults</a> on the AI report generators, according to an investigative news report. Similarly, police chiefs using Axon’s Draft One products <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/04/axon-ai-police-reports-00177331\">did not even know</a> which reports were drafted by AI and which were not because the officers were just cutting and pasting the AI narrative into reports they indicated they wrote themselves. The practice <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency\">bypassed all AI disclaimers and audit trails</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQ2oS87PxeA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The author explains the issues around AI-written police reports in an interview on CNN’s ‘Terms of Service’ podcast.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Many questions</h2>\n\n<p>Transparency is only the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/effs-guide-getting-records-about-axons-ai-generated-police-reports\">first step</a>. Understanding <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4897632\">the risks</a> of relying on AI for police reports is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2oS87PxeA\">the second</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Technological questions arise about how the AI models were trained and the possible biases baked into a reliance on past police reports. Transcription questions arise about errors, omissions and mistranslations because police stops take place in chaotic, loud and frequently emotional contexts amid a host of languages. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, trial questions arise about how an attorney is supposed to cross-examine an AI-generated document, or whether the audit logs need to be retained for expert analysis or turned over to the defense.</p>\n\n<h2>Risks and consequences</h2>\n\n<p>The significance of the California law is not simply that the public needs to be aware of AI risks, but that California is embracing AI risk in policing. I believe it’s likely that people will lose their liberty based on a document that was largely generated by AI and without the hard questions satisfactorily answered.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, in a criminal justice system that relies on plea bargaining for <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/10-209\">more than 95%</a> of cases and is overwhelmingly dominated by misdemeanor offenses, there may never be a chance to check whether the AI report accurately captured the scene. In fact, in many of those lower-level cases, the police report will be the basis of charging decisions, pretrial detention, motions, plea bargains, sentencing and even probation revocations.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that a criminal legal system that relies so heavily on police reports has a responsibility to ensure that police departments are embracing not just transparency but justice. At a minimum, this means more states following Utah and California to pass laws regulating the technology, and police departments following the best practices recommended by the technology companies. </p>\n\n<p>But even that may not be enough without <a href=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract=4897632\">critical assessments</a> by courts, legal experts and defense lawyers. The future of AI policing is just starting, but the risks are already here.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267410/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andrew Guthrie Ferguson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Also known as ultrasound, these sound waves can help clinicians diagnose and monitor disease, and can also provide first glimpses of your newest family members.</p>\n\n<p>And now, patients with conditions ranging <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2024.09.008\">from cancer to</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mric.2024.03.001\">neurodegenerative diseases</a> like Alzheimer’s may soon benefit from recent advances in this technology. </p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aWdoxJcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">biomedical engineer</a> who studies how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000001116\">focused ultrasound</a> – the concentration of sound energy into a specific volume – can be fine-tuned to treat various conditions. Over the past few years, this technology has seen significant growth and use in the clinic. And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease.</p>\n\n<h2>A brief history of focused ultrasound</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound\">Ultrasound is generated</a> with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues.</p>\n\n<p>Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.26.2.179\">heat up and destroy</a> brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf. Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain and even cancer.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Frontal brain MRI\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">MRI of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MRI-guided_HIFU,_essential_tremor,_10-14_135,_pointed.png\">Jmarchn/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet, despite these early findings, technical hurdles stood in the way of applying focused ultrasound in the clinic. For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult. Researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/17/r206\">eventually overcame this problem</a> by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets.</p>\n\n<p>It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. <a href=\"https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/indication-development-pipeline/\">Hundreds of clinical trials</a> aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing. Researchers have found notable success on a condition called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1600159\">essential tremor</a>, which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now <a href=\"https://www.fusfoundation.org/diseases-and-conditions/essential-tremor/\">performed routinely at many locations</a> around the world. </p>\n\n<p>I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system.</p>\n\n<h2>Delivering drugs to the brain</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier-and-how-can-we-overcome-it-75454\">blood-brain barrier</a> is evolution’s exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels. It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target. </p>\n\n<p>More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2202001804\">temporarily open the blood-brain barrier</a> by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate. This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6Sx9y8eytk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment. Clinical trials testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061230\">glioblastoma</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4011\">brain metastases</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2022.114583\">Alzheimer’s disease</a> are underway.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/boyer-lectures-gene-therapy-is-still-in-its-infancy-but-the-future-looks-promising-104558\">Gene therapy</a> involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease. Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>\n\n<p>Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay1344\">facilitate the delivery of gene therapies</a> to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people.</p>\n\n<h2>Stimulating immune responses against cancer</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/anti-cancer-car-t-therapy-reengineers-t-cells-to-kill-tumors-and-researchers-are-expanding-the-limited-types-of-cancer-it-can-target-196471\">Cancer immunotherapy</a> instructs the patient’s own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma – have tumors that are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01979-x\">immunologically “cold,”</a> meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92089\">better recognize and destroy cancer cells</a>. One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world’s first <a href=\"https://med.virginia.edu/uva-focused-ultrasound-cancer-immunotherapy-center/\">focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center</a> in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic. For example, my colleagues are <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472661\">running a clinical trial</a> at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-cancer-cells-can-become-immortal-research-finds-a-mutated-gene-that-helps-melanoma-defeat-the-normal-limits-on-repeated-replication-194234\">advanced melanoma</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound</h2>\n\n<p>Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases.</p>\n\n<p>One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/SVIN.123.001140\">cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM</a>. CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0439\">debilitating neurological symptoms</a>. The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects.</p>\n\n<p>We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113861\">improve drug delivery to CCMs</a>. Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01390-z\">stop CCMs from growing</a> in mice, even without administering a drug. While we don’t yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/25424823251343789\">abundant research on the safety</a> of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM.</p>\n\n<p>With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262622/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richard J.

Researchers have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/making-movies-at-the-attosecond-scale-helps-researchers-better-understand-electrons-and-could-one-day-lead-to-super-fast-electronics-214931\">used them as cameras</a> to study how atoms and molecules move and change inside materials or cells. </p>\n\n<p>But while these X-ray free-electron laser pulses are very short and powerful, they’re not the shortest pulses that scientists can make with lasers. By using more advanced technology and taking advantage of the properties some materials have, researchers can create even shorter pulses: in <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2023/summary/\">the attosecond region</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-an-attosecond-a-physical-chemist-explains-the-tiny-time-scale-behind-nobel-prize-winning-research-214907\">One attosecond</a> is one-billionth of a billionth of a second. An attosecond is to one second about what one second is to the 14 billion-year age of the universe. The fastest processes in atoms and molecules happen at the attosecond scale: For instance, it takes electrons attoseconds to move around inside a molecule. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1ksjPSoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">We’re physicists</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lK1Dn3AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">who work with</a> X-ray free-electron lasers. We study what happens when we put different types of materials in the X-ray free-electron pulses’ path. In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09105-9\">new experiment</a> we put copper and manganese samples in the path of highly focused X-ray free-electron laser pulses. We knew the interactions between these elements and the X-ray free-electron laser pulses would generate new X-ray laser pulses. </p>\n\n<p>Originally, we wanted to find out how different chemical forms of the element manganese – for example, manganese-II and manganese-VII – would create small changes in the wavelengths of these newly generated X-ray laser pulses. </p>\n\n<p>But along the way, we found some unexpected results that made the newly generated X-ray laser pulses act strangely. At first, we did not understand why, but when we eventually figured it out, we realized that we had discovered two unique laser phenomena, and that these effects had helped us generate X-ray laser pulses that where much shorter than we’d expected – shorter than the fastest X-ray pulses ever previously generated. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgaG7f96SKM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The short pulses generated by the laser at SLAC allow researchers to study molecules at the atomic scale or see how different materials interact with X-ray light.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Filamentation – irregular spurts</h2>\n\n<p>We found that our new X-ray laser pulses weren’t always shooting out in the forward direction, as we expected. When we increased the intensity of the X-ray free-electron laser pulses, the resulting new X-ray laser pulses spurted out irregularly, in slightly different directions. </p>\n\n<p>For optical lasers, these irregular spurts – or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filament_propagation\">filamentation</a> – <a href=\"https://www.unige.ch/gap/nonlinear/research/filamentation\">result from</a> the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/refractive-index\">index of refraction</a> changing in the laser material. But we didn’t expect to see this effect for X-rays, since materials – including the manganese and copper we used – don’t refract X-rays very much. </p>\n\n<p>However, the high intensity X-ray free-electron laser pulses we used generated the fluctuations <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics\">at the quantum level</a> in our materials that led to these irregular spurts.</p>\n\n<h2>Rabi cycling – a broad spectrum of light</h2>\n\n<p>Even more surprising than the filamentation effects we saw was the fact that the X-ray pulses we generated contained a variety of different wavelengths that were more spread out than what we expected to see with the materials we used. </p>\n\n<p>Seventy years ago – five years before the first optical laser was built – physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.100.703\">discovered a strange phenomenon</a> in microwaves known as Rabi cycling. And the spread of wavelengths we saw looked just like Rabi cycling.</p>\n\n<p>Autler and Townes knew that when light hit an atom, the atom would absorb its energy by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/excitation\">exciting an electron</a> from one energy level to a higher one. The hole left by that missing electron is filled by an electron that’s coming down from a higher energy level in the atom and releasing – or emitting – this energy difference as light. </p>\n\n<p>What Autler and Townes found was that when the microwaves are very intense, the strong electric field can split each of these energy levels into two distinct levels, called doublets, which have slightly different energies. </p>\n\n<p>These doublets are separated by an energy, or a frequency, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_frequency\">the Rabi frequency</a>. The Rabi frequency <a href=\"https://www.rp-photonics.com/rabi_oscillations.html\">depends on the intensity</a> of the new light. The stronger it is, the larger is the energy separation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A figure showing several roughly spherical blobs of light, in a line with the largest and brightest in the center.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=947&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=947&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=947&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1190&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1190&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684358/original/file-20250806-56-zgy2mv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1190&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An X-ray laser shot spectrum exhibiting the three lines – called a Mollow triplet – that characterize Rabi cycling.

The energy splitting was so small that the Rabi frequency was very low, at radio wave frequencies. </p>\n\n<p>In this new study we used X-rays, which have 100 million times shorter wavelengths than microwaves and 100 million times more energy. This meant the resulting new X-ray laser pulses were split into different X-ray wavelengths corresponding to Rabi frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet region. Ultraviolet light has a frequency 100 million times higher than radio waves. </p>\n\n<p>This Rabi cycling effect <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09105-9\">allowed us to generate</a> the shortest high-energy X-ray pulses to date, clocking in at 60-100 attoseconds.</p>\n\n<h2>Future directions and applications</h2>\n\n<p>While the pulses that X-ray free-electron lasers currently generate allow researchers to observe atomic bonds forming, rearranging and breaking, they are not fast enough to look inside the electron cloud that generates such bonds. Using these new attosecond X-ray laser pulses could allow scientists to study the fastest processes in materials at the atomic-length scale and to discern different elements. </p>\n\n<p>In the future, we also hope to use much shorter X-ray free-electron laser pulses to better generate these attosecond X-ray pulses. We are even hoping to generate pulses below 60 attoseconds by using heavier materials with shorter lifespans, such as tungsten or hafnium. These new X-ray pulses are fast enough to eventually enable scientists to answer questions such as how exactly an electron cloud moves around and what a chemical bond actually is.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258776/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Uwe Bergmann receives funding from the Department of Energy and has previously worked at SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Thomas Linker receives funding from the Department of Energy and works at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.</span></em></p>",

The Conversation spoke with Gaffield about the challenges of presenting the Haitian leader to a modern readership.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What drove you to write the book now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although there have been biographies of Dessalines in Haiti and a heavily fictionalized one in France in 1804, until now there hasn’t been one published in the English language.</p>\n\n<p>And this silence forms part of a much longer process of demonizing Dessalines in the international sphere – he just doesn’t get the same attention that <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/303774/black-spartacus-by-hazareesingh-sudhir/9780141985060\">Toussaint Louverture</a> gets in the narrative of the Haitian Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>What I found interesting was the Desssalines that emerged in my research didn’t match the Dessalines that was being presented in public. I was interested in his international diplomacy and state-making, but many accounts just highlighted the violence of the revolution and Dessalines’ very radical role.</p>\n\n<p>On one side, he is criticized for being uniquely violent – something that wasn’t even true in the context of the time. But characterizing him this way was an attempt to present him as “savage,” “barbaric” and in line with other racist tropes. On the other hand, he is celebrated by Haitians and others for his use of violence. He was seen as the man for the job – the job of ending more than a century of French colonial rule.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left \">\n            <img alt=\"An engraving shows a crude depiction of a man holding a sword holding a severed head.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A crude depiction of Jean-Jacques Dessalines holding the severed head of a white colonist woman used to illustrate Louis Dubroca’s fictionalized biography.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:General_Jean-Jacques_Dessalines_holding_a_mutiliated_white_woman%27s_head.046.jpg\">Manuel López López/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But in the book, I tell a more complicated story of Dessalines. Yes, he was a military leader who fought on the front lines, and success came from violent warfare. But he was a multilayered person; his state-building wasn’t just about violent revolution but also diplomacy and international relations and a deep commitment to abolitionism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why has Dessalines been singled out for committing violence?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A number of different things are at play here. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, the French people reporting on the ground and from abroad held Dessalines and other Haitian revolutionaries to a different standard. While the white French colonists perpetrated acts of extreme brutality and violence, when Haitian revolutionaries fought back, they were criticized for not following the standard rules of warfare.</p>\n\n<p>This was a double standard that all Haitian revolutionaries were held to – but Dessalines was singled out. The Haitian Revolution began in 1791, and the revolutionaries forced France to abolish slavery in 1793. After that time, Dessalines joined France to defend this hard-won freedom. And this is one of the parts of Dessalines’ life that doesn’t often get remembered or talked about – for much of the Haitian Revolution he was a French general, defending the abolition of slavery against attacks from other European empires. But when the French themselves started to undo abolition, Dessalines understood that freedom could be preserved only with independence.</p>\n\n<p>Dessalines’ reputation took on another layer in the war for independence and after. He ended up becoming an enemy of the French state, and criticism of Dessalines’ violence helped the French undermine the fight for Haitian independence, especially internationally.</p>\n\n<p>After he <a href=\"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/haitian-independence/\">declared independence on Jan. 1, 1804</a>, Dessalines executed some of the French colonists who remained on the island. This was legitimized as a way to protect the country from further invasions – which the French were constantly threatening to do. It was also vengeance for the crimes committed by the French colonists during the colonial era and during the horrific expedition sent by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.</p>\n\n<p>The 1804 killings of French people did a lot to forge Dessalines’ image overseas. A lot of the narratives in the early months of 1804 were created from reports written by French and British people who were scared of Haitian independence and scared of the abolition of slavery.</p>\n\n<p>Actual evidence of what happened is limited. But certainly not every white person was killed as is often stated. British and American merchants were safe, Polish people in Haiti were welcomed into the new nation, and even the reports of the number of French people killed undermine each other. Some white French people were even given Haitian citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>But people at the time were not interested in making a nuanced argument or interested in understanding the Haitian perspective, and so they made sweeping claims about every last white person being “massacred.”</p>\n\n<p>These claims were part of a broader effort to demonize Haitians and ensure that independence failed.</p>\n\n<p>And in some ways the emphasis on Dessalines’ violence is odd. It overlooks the violence of slavery and the French colonial rule. The actions of the French in denying their defeat in Haiti were certainly much more significant to Haiti’s long-term future than anything Dessalines did or didn’t do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has the view of Dessalines changed since his lifetime?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Haiti there have been ebbs and flows in how he has been remembered, especially in the 19th century. Part of this is because people there were living in a world in which Haitian sovereignty was not recognized by other counties. While it gained independence under Dessalines in 1804, the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/haitian-rev\">U.S. didn’t recognize it until 1862</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And there were moments when people tied Dessalines’ violent reputation to this foreign nonrecognition. But it was not the only reason that countries did not extend relations to Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t really until the 100th anniversary of independence, in 1904, when Dessalines finally got established in the pantheon of Haitian founding fathers. And it was from then that his memory was more firmly remembered as positive. The national anthem composed to celebrate the centenary is “<a href=\"https://www.classical-music.com/articles/la-dessalinienne-lyrics-haiti-national-anthem-words\">La Dessalinienne</a>,” named in his honor, for example. </p>\n\n<p>In Haitian politics today, he tends to stand in for national sovereignty and the rejection of external influence. That Haiti should exist with no outside meddling is his political reputation nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of Haiti, it is only much more recently that Dessalines’ actions have been seen in a more nuanced way.</p>\n\n<p>But even now there is no consensus over his reputation. There are remnants of his portrayals from more than 200 years ago. Tucker Carlson in 2018 referred to Dessalines as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1912111005760373\">a “genocidal nutcase</a>.” He was talking about the Haitian emperor in the context of a street in an area known as “Little Haiti” in Brooklyn, New York, being renamed in his honor. </p>\n\n<p>But the renaming of the street also plays into the rehabilitation of Dessalines. His image has also been used in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrZYIUPyZyU\">Beats by Dre commercial featuring the tennis player Naomi Osaka</a>. It also was used in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3464896/\">Steve McQueen’s “Small Axe</a>” films.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrZYIUPyZyU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk us through your choice of cover image?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first thing to note is that none of the images we have of Dessalines were done by anyone who ever saw him – so they just made it up. That started with the very racist depiction of him in a Spanish translation of the <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/La-vie-de-J.J.-Dessalines-:-chef-des-noirs-revoltes-de-Saint-Domingue-avec-des-notes-tres-detaillees-sur-l'origine-le-caractere-la-vie-et-les-atrocites-des-principaux-chefs-des-noirs-depuis-l'insurrection-de-1791/oclc/5231703\">1804 biography “La Vie de J-J Dessalines</a>” by Louis Dubroca, which included a person meant to be Dessalines holding a decapitated white woman’s head. That image circulated and stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar racist depictions were released, all meant to support an argument that Dessalines was born in Africa – which he wasn’t – and was very “African”-like, by which they meant “savage.”</p>\n\n<p>The painting I used for the cover is by Haitian artist Ulrick Jean-Pierre. It shows Dessalines standing boldly and confidently. I also like the fact that the feathers on the cap and trees behind him are swaying: He is standing boldly but in a stormy, unsettled and complicated era.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was researching the book tricky, given the bias of many sources?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the records on the Haitian revolution were written by people who opposed the revolutionaries. But there is not nothing from the other side – there are accounts of these events written by Haitians, and there are letters and declarations by Dessalines himself. These, in my opinion, haven’t been taken as seriously as they could have because so many people were trying to undermine Dessalines’ political project. Throughout the book I take Dessalines’ words seriously, and those of his fellow Haitian revolutionaries.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I encountered when I started this research was a lot of people saying, “There’s not a lot of sources for that.” One strategy I employed was looking for sources everywhere and anywhere. You can find sources on the revolution in Haiti but also in the U.S., France, the Netherlands, England, the Vatican and in Jamaica – anyplace that had interactions with Haiti. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you learn during the writing of the book?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I got a better sense of how personal the Haitian Revolution was to Dessalines. I had initially studied Dessalines through the lens of international diplomacy. So I saw him as a head of state, rather than an individual.</p>\n\n<p>Through the research, I got a much better sense of the experiences that drove the man and his fight for freedom and against colonization – through his experiences with his extended family and his interactions with colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>At the cost of personal relations and personal safety, he fought for freedom – and that was the driving force behind everything for Dessalines: the fight to abolish slavery.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266326/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julia Gaffield received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. </span></em></p>",

At the same time, health care providers, teachers and school systems have reported <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119427\">an uptick in requests for ADHD assessments</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These reports have led some experts and parents to wonder <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd-overdiagnosed\">whether ADHD is being overdiagnosed and overtreated</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As researchers who have <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PtJmhRwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">spent our careers studying neurodevelopmental disorders</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GuqlxnAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">like ADHD</a>, we are concerned that fears about widespread overdiagnosis are misplaced, perhaps based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the condition.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding ADHD as one end of a spectrum</h2>\n\n<p>Discussions about overdiagnosis of ADHD imply that you either have it or you don’t. </p>\n\n<p>However, when epidemiologists ask people in the general population about their symptoms of ADHD, some have a few symptoms, some have a moderate level, and a few have lots of symptoms. But there is no clear dividing line between those who are diagnosed with ADHD and those who are not, since ADHD – much like blood pressure – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547231222228\">occurs on a spectrum</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Treating mild ADHD is similar to treating mild high blood pressure – it depends on the situation. Care can be helpful when a doctor considers the details of a person’s daily life and how much the symptoms are affecting them.</p>\n\n<p>Not only can ADHD symptoms be very different from person to person, but research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12475\">ADHD symptoms can change within an individual</a>. For example, symptoms become more severe when the challenges of life increase. </p>\n\n<p>ADHD symptoms <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21010032\">fluctuate depending on many factors</a>, including whether the person is at school or home, whether they have had enough sleep, if they are under a great deal of stress or if they are taking medications or other substances. Someone who has mild ADHD may not experience many symptoms while they are on vacation and well rested, for example, but they may have impairing symptoms if they have a demanding job or school schedule and have not gotten enough sleep. These people may need treatment for ADHD in certain situations but may do just fine without treatment in other situations.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to what is seen in conditions like high blood pressure, which can change from day to day or from month to month, depending on a person’s diet, stress level and many other factors.</p>\n\n<h2>Can ADHD symptoms change over time?</h2>\n\n<p>ADHD symptoms start in early childhood and typically are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-017-0853-z\">at their worst in mid-to late childhood</a>. Thus, the average age of diagnosis is between 9 and 12 years old. This age is also the time when children are transitioning from elementary school to middle school and may also be experiencing changes in their environment that make their symptoms worse. </p>\n\n<p>Classes can be more challenging beginning around fifth grade than in earlier grades. In addition, the transition to middle school typically means that children move from having all their subjects taught by one teacher in a single classroom to having to change classrooms with a different teacher for each class. These changes can exacerbate symptoms that were previously well-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms can also wax and wane throughout life. For most people, symptoms improve – but may not completely disappear – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/ms9.0000000000000631\">after age 25</a>, which is also the time when the brain has typically finished developing. </p>\n\n<p>Psychiatric problems that often co-occur with ADHD, such as anxiety or depression, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1597559\">can worsen ADHD symptoms that are already present</a>. These conditions can also mimic ADHD symptoms, making it difficult to know which to treat. High levels of stress leading to poorer sleep, and increased demands at work or school, can also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536207\">exacerbate or cause ADHD-like symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the use of some substances, such as marijuana or sedatives, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2019.1634086\">can worsen, or even cause, ADHD symptoms</a>. In addition to making symptoms worse in someone who already has an ADHD diagnosis, these factors can also push someone who has mild symptoms into full-blown ADHD, at least for a short time. </p>\n\n<p>The reverse is also true: Symptoms of ADHD can be minimized or reversed in people who do not meet full diagnostic criteria once the external cause is removed. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_If_MX8h8I?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Kids with ADHD often have overlapping symptoms with anxiety, depression, dyslexia and more.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How prevalence is determined</h2>\n\n<p>Clinicians diagnose ADHD based on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. To make an ADHD diagnosis in children, six or more symptoms in <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\">at least one of these three categories</a> must be present. For adults, five or more symptoms are required, but they must begin in childhood. For all ages, the symptoms must cause serious problems in at least two areas of life, such as home, school or work. </p>\n\n<p>Current estimates show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyt261\">the strict prevalence of ADHD</a> is about 5% in children. In young adults, the figure drops to 3%, and it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04009\">less than 1% after age 60</a>. Researchers use the term “strict prevalence” to mean the percentage of people who meet all of the criteria for ADHD based on epidemiological studies. It is an important number because it provides clinicians and scientists with an estimate on how many people are expected to have ADHD in a given group of people. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the “diagnosed prevalence” is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with ADHD based on real-world assessments by health care professionals. The diagnosed prevalence in the U.S. and Canada ranges <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119427\">from 7.5% to 11.1%</a> in children under age 18. These rates are quite a bit higher than the strict prevalence of 5%.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers claim that the difference between the diagnosed prevalence and the strict prevalence <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">means that ADHD is overdiagnosed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We disagree. In clinical practice, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425787\">the diagnostic rules</a> allow a patient to be diagnosed with ADHD if they have most of the symptoms that cause distress, impairment or both, even when they don’t meet the full criteria. And much evidence shows that increases in the diagnostic prevalence can be attributed to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">diagnosing milder cases</a> that may have been missed previously. The validity of these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2019.02.003\">mild diagnoses is well-documented</a>.    </p>\n\n<p>Consider children who have five inattentive symptoms and five hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. These children would not meet strict diagnostic criteria for ADHD even though they clearly have a lot of ADHD symptoms. But in clinical practice, these children would be diagnosed with ADHD if they had marked distress, disability or both because of their symptoms – in other words, if the symptoms were interfering substantially with their everyday lives. </p>\n\n<p>So it makes sense that the diagnosed prevalence of ADHD is substantially higher than the strict prevalence.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Middle-aged woman sitting at a table and giving a pill to an adolescent girl, who is sipping a glass of water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A robust body of literature shows the negative outcomes associated with underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/medication-time-royalty-free-image/2148402028?phrase=ADHD&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">SolStock/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Implications for patients, parents and clinicians</h2>\n\n<p>People who are concerned about overdiagnosis commonly worry that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/magazine/adhd-medication-treatment-research.html\">people are taking medications</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">they don’t need</a> or that they are diverting resources away from those who need it more. Other concerns are that people may experience side effects from the medications, or that they may be stigmatized by a diagnosis. </p>\n\n<p>Those concerns are important. However, there is strong evidence that underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.01.022\">lead to serious negative outcomes</a> in school, work, mental health and quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the risks of not treating ADHD are well-established. In contrast, the potential harms of overdiagnosis <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">remain largely unproven</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to consider how to manage the growing number of milder cases, however. Research suggests that children and adults with less severe ADHD symptoms may benefit less from medication than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.1281\">those with more severe symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This raises an important question: How much benefit is enough to justify treatment? These are decisions best made in conversations between clinicians, patients and caregivers.</p>\n\n<p>Because ADHD symptoms can shift with age, stress, environment and other life circumstances, treatment needs to be flexible.

Unfortunately, a few days after Peaches was <a href=\"https://www.islander.org/2023/09/will-flamingos-call-this-gulf-coast-home/\">released back into the wilds of Tampa Bay</a>, the tracking device failed. His last reported sighting was on a beach near Marco Island on Oct. 5, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in June 2025, I received an email from colleagues at the Rio Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatan, Mexico, who <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2025/06/11/peaches-idalia-flamingo-spotted-in-yucatan\">had photographed Peaches, blue band still in place</a>, nesting in the reserve.</p>\n\n<p>Peaches’ story is the latest piece in the historical puzzle of flamingos in Florida. Though the native population disappeared more than 100 years ago, recent events lead me to believe that flamingos may be coming back to the Sunshine State, and that their return has been facilitated by the concerted effort to restore the Everglades and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n\n<h2>Decimation of a population</h2>\n\n<p>In 1956, ornithologist and founder of the <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/florida/projects/everglades-science-center\">National Audubon’s Everglades Science Center</a> <a href=\"https://www.rpanaturalarea.org/robert-porter-allen\">Robert Porter Allen</a> wrote “<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article-abstract/75/2/228/5223157\">The Flamingos: Their Life History and Survival</a>,” which is still considered a seminal document on the history of flamingos in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>In his book, Allen cites several historical and scientific manuscripts from the 1800s that indicate flamboyances of hundreds to thousands were seen in the Everglades, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.</p>\n\n<p>Allen documents the demise of flamingos in the late 1800s, in Florida and throughout their Caribbean and Bahamian range. Like all wading birds in Florida, they fell victim to the women’s fashion trend of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wgs49RgFN8\">adorning hats with bird feathers</a>. Wading bird feathers were literally worth their weight in gold.</p>\n\n<p>Led by the National Association of Audubon Societies’ vocal opposition, the grassroots environmental movement that followed brought about laws prohibiting the hunting and sale of bird feathers. But enforcement of those laws in sparsely populated Florida was difficult, and on two occasions <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813034423\">deputized Audubon wardens were murdered</a> protecting wading bird nesting colonies.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, within a few years, societal pressure turned the tide against the practice of wearing feathers. The passage of the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/law/migratory-bird-treaty-act-1918\">Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918</a> officially ended the feather trade.</p>\n\n<p>Given legal protection, most species managed to reestablish huge nesting populations in the Everglades by the 1930s-1940s, presumably migrating from remote populations in Central America and the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos, however, did not.</p>\n\n<h2>A long road to recovery</h2>\n\n<p>In 1956, 40 years after hunting had ended, Allen estimated flamingo populations were only about 25% of what they had been in the previous century, with numbers plummeting from 168,000 to 43,000 breeding adults. They nested in significant numbers at only four locations, compared to 29 historically.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos’ unique breeding behaviors and their longevity – they can live up to 50 years in the wild – may account for their struggle to bounce back. Other Florida wading birds can nest multiple times a year at different locations, laying three to five eggs at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos, on the other hand, nest only once a year, generally returning to the same location year after year, and lay only one egg. Furthermore, they prefer forming huge nesting colonies, with thousands of nests, in part due to their elaborate group courtship rituals.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason to hope</h2>\n\n<p>As a result of their rarity from the 1950s to 1980s, scientists – including myself – believed that any flamingos sighted intermittently around Florida were not wild birds but rather escapees from captive populations.</p>\n\n<p>The largest flock observed in the state between 1930 and 1976 was 14 birds spotted in Biscayne Bay in 1934, on the day after <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/century/2025-08-21/hialeah-flamingos-race-track-centennial-anniversary\">Hialeah Race Track in Miami imported a group of about 30 flamingos</a>. The track’s owners had failed to <a href=\"https://explore.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/grounded-the-pinioning-of-captive-birds\">pinion</a> the birds, and they simply flew away upon release.</p>\n\n<p>But my opinion began to change in 2002, when a flamingo that was banded as a chick at Rio Lagartos was photographed in Florida Bay. In 2012, <a href=\"https://brevardzoo.org/news/celebrating-the-inaugural-international-flamingo-day/\">a second bird</a> from Rio Lagartos was photographed.</p>\n\n<p>By that time, I had observed flamingos in Florida Bay on several occasions, including larger flamboyances of 24 and 64 individuals. Although I still thought the majority of these flocks were escapees, the banded birds provided some evidence that at least a few wild flamingos were starting to spend time in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2015, my colleagues put a <a href=\"https://www.zoomiami.org/florida-flamingo-program\">tracking device on a flamingo they had captured</a> at the Key West Naval Air Station. Conchy, as we called him, was given the blue band US01 and released in Florida Bay in December 2015.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.audubon.org/rsc_file/fl/ffn_492_page_58-81.pdf\">He lived in Florida Bay for two years</a>, and the fact that he stayed for that long was proof to me that it was possible for flamingos to make a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/590378419/floridas-long-lost-wild-flamingos-were-hiding-in-plain-sight\">more permanent home in Florida</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFYh-D3yvY0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Conchy was banded and given a GPS tracker by Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami before being re-released into Florida Bay in 2015.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In 2018, several colleagues and I published a paper laying out both evidence from historical accounts and also previously overlooked evidence from museums that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-187.1\">flamingos were native to Florida</a>. We also presented new data from researchers and citizen science portals that strongly indicated that wild flamingo numbers were increasing in Florida. This suggested that the population might be finally recovering.</p>\n\n<h2>Call it a comeback</h2>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and it appears that this slow comeback may finally have legs. Six months after Hurricane Idalia, my colleagues at Audubon Florida and I conducted a weeklong online survey of flamingo sightings in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>We received more than 50 reputable observations. After sorting through these observations to remove duplicates, we concluded that at least <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/florida/news/more-100-american-flamingos-counted-florida-during-february-census\">100 flamingos were left in the state</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then in July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/environment/2025-07-07/flamingos-florida-bay-everglades\">a flock of 125 individuals</a> was photographed in Florida Bay. Based on our observations, my colleagues and I believe that the flamingos that arrived with Idalia may be reestablishing a home in Florida.</p>\n\n<h2>Progress toward restoration</h2>\n\n<p>The question is, why now? The 24 flamingos I saw in 1992 and the 64 I saw in 2004 didn’t take up permanent residence in the state. So what’s changed?</p>\n\n<p>To me, the answer is clear: Efforts to restore the Everglades and Florida’s coastal ecosystems are beginning to show progress.</p>\n\n<p>When I arrived in the Keys in 1989, Florida Bay was <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/1603/#:%7E:text=Conservation%20issues%20presented%20to%20the,including%20the%20State%20of%20Florida\">undergoing an ecological collapse</a>. A 1993 interagency report by the federal government found that a hundred years of draining, diking and rerouting the flows of the Everglades to create urban and agricultural lands had <a href=\"https://scispace.com/pdf/deterioration-of-the-florida-bay-ecosystem-an-evaluation-of-4pot0gljt5.pdf\">raised the salt content</a> of the water, making it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0377-1\">uninhabitable for many estuarine animals</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The report noted that the bay’s famous seagrass beds were undergoing a massive die-off, accompanied by algal blooms that depleted oxygen levels, thereby killing fish in large numbers. Mangrove trees were dying on its myriad islands, and birds that for decades had nested in them had disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>These events kick-started Everglades restoration efforts, and in 2000 the U.S. Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/cerp.htm\">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> with nearly unanimous bipartisan support. With a cost in the tens of billions of dollars, it was to be the largest and most expensive ecological restoration project the world has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the bay’s health is vastly improved from the condition I observe in the 1980s. Water flow has gotten better, and the salinity is <a href=\"https://floridaspecifier.com/issues/v46n3/2024-environmental-report-highlights-everglades-restoration-progress/\">back to appropriate levels</a> to support wildlife.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 and 2021, <a href=\"https://media.audubon.org/rsc_file/fl/sfwbr_af_2021v10_0.pdf\">more than 100,000 pairs of wading birds</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/white-ibis\">white ibis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/wood-stork\">wood storks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/roseate-spoonbill\">roseate spoonbills</a> nested in the Everglades. These numbers hadn’t been seen since the 1940s. In the 1980s and 1990s, 20,000 nesting pairs was <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/SFWBR_2021_Final_3-13-23.pdf\">thought to be a banner year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the Everglades and Florida Bay are still a long way from full restoration, I believe that the return of flamingos such as Conchy and Peaches is evidence that these efforts are on the right track.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258658/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jerome Lorenz has received funding from The Lynn and Louis Wolfson II Family Foundation, the Batchelor Foundation and the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment.

A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in <a href=\"http://hurricanezone.org/tracking/pacific-w3.php\">forecasting its track</a> into the Bering Sea.</p>\n\n<p>But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways. </p>\n\n<p>The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A weather map with the storm's locations over time, headed toward Nome but then turning.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm track showing its turn toward Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Rick Thoman</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696173/original/file-20251014-56-vee6sw.jpeg\">final track and intensity weren’t clear</a> until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places.</p>\n\n<h2>Did the loss of weather balloon data canceled in 2025 affect the forecast?</h2>\n\n<p>That’s a question for future research, but here’s what we know for sure: There have not been any upper-air <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hurricane-forecasts-are-more-accurate-than-ever-noaa-funding-cuts-could-change-that-with-a-busy-storm-season-coming-255369\">weather balloon observations</a> at Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea since late August or at Kotzebue since February. Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea.</p>\n\n<p>Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong?</h2>\n\n<p>The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/2024-10-18/the-yk-deltas-permafrost-could-be-entirely-gone-within-decades\">Permafrost is also thawing</a>, land is subsiding, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58270-w\">sea-level rise</a> is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/2025-10-12/bethel-flooding-expected-to-recede-after-sunday-typhoon-remnant-impacts\">Even Bethel</a>, the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong.</p>\n\n<p>These are <a href=\"https://www.ykhc.org/story/about-yk/\">very remote communities</a> with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26186061-10132025-ykhc-response-to-typhoon-halong/\">a lot of people with nowhere to live</a>, and winter is closing in.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ll5P2Kw5riE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/public-safety/2024-08-18/bering-sea-storm-brings-erosion-and-flooding-to-western-alaska-communities\">major flooding in summer 2024</a>. Kipnuk’s tribe was able to get <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/public-safety/2025-01-04/following-august-flood-kipnuk-becomes-second-alaska-tribe-to-ever-receive-federal-disaster-declaration\">federal disaster aid</a>, but that aid was approved only in early January 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>What are these communities facing in terms of recovery?</h2>\n\n<p>People are going to have really difficult decisions to make. Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer?</p>\n\n<p>There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easy answer.</p>\n\n<p>It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"3NqmJ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3NqmJ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work.</p>\n\n<p>Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities. Even if national or state help is approved, it would be next summer before most homes could be rebuilt.</p>\n\n<h2>Is climate change playing a role in storms like these?</h2>\n\n<p>That will be another question for future research, but sea-surface temperature in most of the North Pacific that Typhoon Halong passed over before reaching the Aleutian Islands has been <a href=\"https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current/california-current-marine-heatwave-tracker-blobtracker\">much warmer than normal</a>. Warm water fuels storms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An animated map shows anomalously warm temperatures across the ocean between Japan and the U.S.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=364&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=364&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=364&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=458&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=458&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696059/original/file-20251014-56-s4xop0.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=458&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A comparison of daily sea-surface temperatures shows how anomalously warm much of the northern Pacific Ocean was ahead of and during Typhoon Halong.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php\">NOAA Coral Reef Watch</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Halong also brought lots of very warm air northward with it.

He makes his displeasure clear in public speeches, interviews and congressional testimony. </p>\n\n<p>The network, afraid of the regulatory agency’s power to license their owned-and-operated stations, responds quickly. They change the content of their broadcasts. Network executives understand the FCC’s criticism is supported by the White House, and the chairman implicitly represents the president. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not just referring to the recent controversy between <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/27/brendan-carr-kimmel-fcc-00583301\">FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel</a>. The same chain of events has happened repeatedly in U.S. history.</p>\n\n<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s FCC chairman, James Lawrence Fly, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19376529.2025.2492552\">warned the networks about censoring news commentators</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was John F. Kennedy’s FCC chairman, <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/the-vast-wasteland-reconsidered/\">Newton Minow</a>, who <a href=\"https://time.com/4315217/newton-minow-vast-wasteland-1961-speech/\">criticized the networks</a> for not airing more news and public affairs programming to support American democracy during the Cold War. </p>\n\n<p>And there was George W. Bush’s FCC chairman, Michael Powell. He decided that a fleeting “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-jumps-into-bared-breast-flap/\">wardrobe malfunction</a>” during <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/lifestyle/history/2004-halftime-show-wardrobe-malfunction-overshadows-super-bowl-xxxviii\">the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show</a> – when Janet Jackson’s breast was exposed – was sufficient to punish CBS with a fine.</p>\n\n<p>In each of those cases, the FCC represented the views of the White House. And in each case, the regulatory agency was employed to pressure the networks into airing content more aligned with the administration’s ideology.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s interesting in those four examples is that two of the FCC chairmen were Democrats – Fly and Minow – and two were Republicans – Powell and Carr.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://cmj.umaine.edu/faculty-staff/michael-j-socolow/\">a media historian</a>, I’m aware of the long-existing bipartisan enthusiasm for exploiting the fact that no First Amendment exists in American broadcasting. Pressuring broadcasters by leveraging FCC power occurs regardless of which party controls the White House. And when the agency is used in partisan fashion, the rival party will criticize such politicization of regulation as a threat to free speech.</p>\n\n<p>This recurring cycle is made possible by the fact that broadcasting is licensed by the government. Since a <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep319/usrep319190/usrep319190.pdf\">Supreme Court decision in 1943</a>, the supremacy of the FCC in broadcast regulation has been unquestioned. </p>\n\n<p>Such strong governmental oversight separates broadcasting from any other medium of mass communication in the United States. And it’s the reason why there’s no “free speech” when it comes to Kimmel, or any other performer, on U.S. airwaves. </p>\n\n<h2>The FCC’s empowerment</h2>\n\n<p>Since its establishment in 1934, the FCC’s primary role in broadcasting has been to authorize local station licenses “<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/communications-act-1934.pdf\">in the public interest, convenience, or necessity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In 1938, the FCC began its first investigation into network practices and policies, which resulted in new regulations. One of the new rules stated that no network could own and operate more than one licensed station in any single market. This forced NBC, which owned two networks that operated stations in several markets, to divest itself of one of its networks. NBC sued. </p>\n\n<p>In the first serious constitutional test of the FCC’s full authority, in 1943, the Supreme Court vindicated the FCC’s expansive power over all U.S. broadcasting in its 5–4 verdict in <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/national-broadcasting-co-v-united-states/\">National Broadcasting Co. v. United States</a>. The ruling has stood since.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why there’s no First Amendment in broadcasting. The Supreme Court ruled that, due to spectrum scarcity – the idea that the airwaves are a limited public resource and therefore not every American can operate a broadcast station – the FCC’s power over broadcasting must be expansive.  </p>\n\n<p>The 1934 act, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/190/\">the 1943 Supreme Court decision read</a>, “gave the Commission … expansive powers … and a comprehensive mandate to ‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest,’ if need be, by making ‘special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain (network) broadcasting.’”</p>\n\n<p>The ruling also explains why the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/American-Broadcasting-Company\">FCC can be credited with having created the American Broadcasting Company</a>. Yes, the same ABC that suspended Kimmel in the face of FCC threats was the network that emerged from NBC’s forced divestiture of its Blue Network as a result of the 1943 Supreme Court decision. </p>\n\n<p>The empowerment of the FCC by NBC v. U.S. led to such content restrictions as <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/fairness-doctrine/\">the Fairness Doctrine</a>, which intended to ensure balanced political broadcasting, instituted in 1949, and later, additional FCC rules against obscenity and indecency on the airwaves.

They invested far more money into news and public affairs programming. That led to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Expanding_Vista.html?id=-6dA8G5sOSAC\">significantly more news reporting and documentary production</a> throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n\n<h2>A ‘hands-off’ FCC</h2>\n\n<p>In the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0429/078.html\">FCC Chairman Powell promised</a> to “refashion the FCC into an outfit that is fast, decisive and, above all, hands-off.”  </p>\n\n<p>Yet his promise to be “hands-off” did not apply to content regulation. In 2004, his FCC concluded a contentious legal battle with Clear Channel Communications over comments ruled “indecent” by shock jock Howard Stern. The settlement resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/clear-channel-reaches-175-million-settlement-fcc/\">US$1.75 million payment by Clear Channel Communications</a> – the largest fine ever collected by the FCC for speech on the airwaves.  </p>\n\n<p>Powell apparently enjoyed policing content, as evidenced by the $550,000 fine his FCC levied against CBS for the fleeting exposure of singer Janet Jackson’s breast during the Super Bowl. The fine was <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/wardrobe-malfunction-case-finally-ends/\">eventually overturned</a>. But Powell did successfully <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-243802A3.pdf\">lobby Congress</a> to significantly hike the amount of money <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/broadcast-decency-enforcement-act-of-2005/\">the FCC could fine broadcasters for indecency</a>. The fine for a single incident increased from $32,000 to $325,000, and up to $3 million if a network broadcasts it on multiple stations. </p>\n\n<p>Powell’s regulatory activism, done mostly to curb the outrageous antics of radio shock jocks, resulted in some of the most significant and long-lasting <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=dltr\">restrictions on broadcast freedom in U.S. history</a>.  Thus, Carr’s 2025 threats toward ABC can be viewed in a historical context as an extension of established FCC activism. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Demonstrators holds signs in front of a building with columns.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Demonstrators hold signs on Sept. 18, 2025, outside Los Angeles’ El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where the late-night show ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ is staged.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Jimmy%20Kimmel%20protest&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But Carr’s threat also appeared to contradict his previously espoused values. </p>\n\n<p>As the author of the FCC section in <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">Project 2025</a>, a conservative blueprint for federal government policies, Carr wrote: “The FCC should promote freedom of speech … and pro-growth reforms that support a diversity of viewpoints.” In exploiting the FCC’s licensing power to threaten to penalize speech he found offensive, Carr failed to promote either freedom of speech or diversity of viewpoints.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s one thing the Carr-Kimmel episode teaches us, it’s that more Americans should know the structural constraints in the U.S. system of broadcasting. Media literacy has proved essential as curbs to free expression – both official and unofficial – have become more popular.</p>\n\n<p>When the FCC threatens a broadcaster, it does so in Americans’ name. </p>\n\n<p>If Americans applaud regulatory activism when it supports their partisan beliefs, consistency demands they accept the same regulatory activism in the hands of their political opponents. If Americans prefer their political opposition show restraint in the regulation of broadcasting, then they need to promote restraint when their preferred administration is in power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266206/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michael J.

People in the United States can, for instance, join protests, criticize the government and say things that others find offensive.</p>\n\n<p>But the First Amendment only applies to the government – which includes public colleges and universities – and not private institutions or companies, including private colleges and universities. </p>\n\n<p>This means private colleges typically have wide authority to discipline <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-i/interpretations/266\">employees for their speech</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, public colleges are considered part of the government. The First Amendment limits the legal authority they have over their employees’ speech. This is <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/what-free-speech-rights-do-government-employees-have\">especially true when an employee is speaking as a private citizen</a> – such as participating in a political rally outside of work hours, for example. </p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 1968 case that public employees’ speech rights as private citizens can extend to criticizing their employer, like if they write a letter critical of their employer <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/510\">to a newspaper</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-473\">Supreme Court also ruled in 2006</a> that \nthe First Amendment does not protect public employees from being disciplined by their employers when they say or write something as part of their official job duties. </p>\n\n<p>Even when a public college employee is speaking outside of their job duties as a private citizen, they might not be guaranteed First Amendment protection. To reach this legal threshold, what they say must be about something of importance to the public, or <a href=\"https://houstonlawreview.org/article/73668-the-free-speech-of-public-employees-at-a-time-of-political-polarization-clarifying-the-_pickering_-balancing-test\">what courts call a “matter of public concern</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Talking or writing about news, politics or social matters – Kirk’s murder – often meets the legal test for when speech is about a matter of public concern. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, courts have ruled that personal workplace <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1251\">complaints or gossip typically does not</a> guarantee freedom of speech protection. </p>\n\n<p>And in some cases, even when a public employee speaks as a private citizen on a topic that a court considers a matter of public concern, their speech may still be unprotected. </p>\n\n<p>A public employer can still convince a court that its reasons for prohibiting an employee’s speech – like preventing conflict among co-workers – are important enough to deny this employee <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/pickering-balancing-test-for-government-employee-speech\">First Amendment protection</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Lawsuits brought by the employees of public colleges and universities who have been fired for their comments about Kirk may likely be decided based on whether what they said or wrote amounts to a matter of public concern. Another important factor is whether a court is convinced that an employee’s speech about Kirk was serious enough to disrupt a college’s operations, thus justifying the employee’s firing.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic freedom and professors’ speech</h2>\n\n<p>There are also questions over whether professors at public universities, in particular, can cite other legal rights to protect their speech. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://faculty.umd.edu/academic-freedom\">Academic freedom</a> refers to a faculty member’s rights connected to their <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/5/2/64\">teaching and research expertise</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At both private and public colleges, professors’ work contracts – like the ones typically <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/tenure\">signed after receiving tenure</a> – potentially provide legal protections for faculty speech connected to academic freedom, such as in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>However, the First Amendment does not apply to how a private college regulates its professors’ speech or academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Professors at public colleges have at least the same First Amendment free speech rights as their fellow employees, like when speaking in a private citizen capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the First Amendment might protect a public college professor’s work-related speech when academic freedom concerns arise, like in their teaching and research. </p>\n\n<p>In 2006, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the First Amendment covers academic freedom, in a case where it found the First Amendment did not cover what public employees say when carrying <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-473\">out their official work</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Supreme Court has not dealt with this complicated issue. And lower federal courts have reached conflicting decisions about First Amendment protection for public college professors’ speech in their teaching and research.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large gray stone plaque shows the First Amendment in front of a green grassy field and buildings in the distance.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The First Amendment is on display in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/first-amendment-and-independence-hall-royalty-free-image/147097695?phrase=first%20amendment&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">StephanieCraig/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Future of free speech for university employees</h2>\n\n<p>Some colleges, especially public ones, are testing the legal limits of their authority over their employees’ speech. </p>\n\n<p>These incidents demonstrate a culture of <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/polarization-campuses-civil-discourse-dialogue-aacu-2025/738426/\">extreme political polarization</a> in higher education. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond legal questions, colleges are also grappling with how to define their commitments to free speech and academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we believe campus leaders should consider the purpose of higher education.

      "content": "<p>As millions of student loan borrowers settle into the school year, many are stressed about how they’ll pay for their degrees. These students may find that the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text/enr\">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>, the big tax and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, could limit how much they can borrow.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently, graduate students could take out two types of federal loans: <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>, which had a lifetime limit of US$138,500, and <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/grad\">Grad PLUS loans</a>, which allowed students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, minus financial aid.</p>\n\n<p>But Grad PLUS loans will be <a href=\"https://www.uclawsf.edu/admissions/financial-aid/important-federal-student-loan-changes-effective-july-1-2026/#:%7E:text=A.-,Key%20Changes,be%20available%20to%20new%20borrowers.\">eliminated</a> next summer, with a <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/uploads/documents/Federal_Student_Aid_Change_OB3.pdf\">three-year transitional period</a> for current borrowers. That will leave only the capped loans for new borrowers, and those loans have new lifetime borrowing limits: $200,000 for students pursuing certain <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477646/student-loan-repayment-forgiveness-trump\">professional degrees</a>, and $100,000 for nonprofessional graduate programs.</p>\n\n<p>If you add both undergraduate and graduate loans, there’s a new lifetime limit of $257,500 per person.</p>\n\n<p>That seems modest to me. Consider that the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/235651/us-university-attendance-cost/\">annual average costs</a> for an undergraduate degree range from <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cua\">$24,920 for in-state public universities</a> to <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cua\">$58,000 for private universities</a>. That means we’re looking at up to $224,000 for a bachelor’s degree. If we add three years of law school, we’re looking at <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/law/law-school-cost/\">an additional $132,000 to $168,000</a>, respectively. Alternatively, completing <a href=\"https://students-residents.aamc.org/financial-aid-resources/you-can-afford-medical-school\">four years of medical school</a> will set you back another $268,000 to $363,000. It’s not easy to make those numbers add up to less than $257,500.</p>\n\n<p>As I reflect on these numbers and my journey to becoming <a href=\"https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/rodney-coates.html\">a college professor</a>, specializing in race and ethnic studies, one thing becomes clear: I would never have been able to earn my bachelor’s degree, two master’s degrees, and Ph.D. under these new rules. </p>\n\n<p>Adjusting for inflation, I took out nearly $300,000 in student loans, and I paid them all off within a decade of starting my college teaching career. For me, the system worked. I wonder how today’s aspiring professionals, especially those from less prosperous backgrounds, will manage.</p>\n\n<h2>The future of professionals</h2>\n\n<p>Professional students already graduate with a lot of debt – often far more than the new loan caps will allow. In 2020, more than a quarter of graduating medical students and nearly 60% of graduating dental students had <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/60639/full-impact-changes-to-college-financial-aid-and-higher-ed/\">borrowed more than the new limits would allow</a>, author Mark Kantrowitz, <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/author/mkantrowitz/\">who is an expert on student loans</a>, has found. In 2024, <a href=\"https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/12846/download\">nearly a quarter of medical school graduates</a> left school with more than $300,000 in debt.</p>\n\n<p>The new borrowing limits will likely hit minority students especially hard. While about <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics\">61% of all graduate students take out student loans</a>, the share is <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics\">much higher</a> for Black students compared with white students, 48% to 17%. </p>\n\n<p>While some might be able to supplement their federal loans with private ones – which tend to have much worse terms for borrowers – I fear that many others will be forced to end their educations prematurely.</p>\n\n<p>That, in turn, would worsen the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-how-aspiring-black-doctors-see-trumps-new-loan-cap\">already severe shortage of doctors serving the Black community</a>. As pointed out in a <a href=\"http://doi.org/doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.6687\">2023 report of the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, the shortage of Black primary care physicians is directly related to overall lower population health and ultimately higher mortality rates within the Black community. As of 2023, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/health/black-doctors-shortage-us/index.html\">fewer than 6%</a> of U.S. doctors were Black, versus <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/\">14.4% of the population</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Research has suggested that student loan relief would <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac862\">help diversify the medical workforce</a>. Adding new restrictions would likely have the opposite effect, making the profession more homogeneous and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2020/09/when-it-comes-to-us-health-systems-diversity-matters.html\">significantly undermining Black public health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or consider attorneys. Law school costs have risen <a href=\"https://clp.law.harvard.edu/knowledge-hub/magazine/issues/student-debt/the-black-white-student-debt-gap-among-law-school-graduates\">more than 600%</a> over the past two decades. The average 2020 law school graduate <a href=\"https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law-student-debt-averages-165k-at-graduation-creating-stress-and-restricting-choices-survey-says\">left with $165,000 in student debt</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Black law students face unique challenges, graduating with approximately 8% more debt on average than white students and facing <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/cew-roi_law.pdf\">significant wage disparities</a> once they enter the legal workforce. Making it harder for Black students to afford law school could reduce the <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/news/profile-legal-profession/demographics/\">number of Black attorneys</a>, which has held steady at about 5% of active lawyers over the past 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing access to federal student loans risks disproportionately affecting women, since they hold <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/issues/education/student-debt/\">roughly two-thirds of all student debt</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\n\n<p>Supporters of the change say that capping graduate student borrowing will <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\">encourage universities to rein in tuition hikes</a>. They also say <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/09/24/trump-is-slashing-grad-school-loans-these-companies-are-scrambling-to-step-in/\">private student loan providers</a> will step in to help students. I am skeptical, but the true test will come next year.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, professional students might want to familiarize themselves with the many scholarship opportunities available. Many organizations offer a range of <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/students-residents/medical-students/begin-your-medical-education/debt-management/funding-options/scholarships.html\">medical school scholarships</a>, including those targeting <a href=\"https://www.amwa-doc.org/students/awards/\">women</a> and <a href=\"https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/medical-school-scholarships-for-minorities/\">minorities</a>. The same is true for students interested in law school. A helpful starting point is <a href=\"https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/law-scholarships\">this list of scholarships with approaching deadlines</a> and these <a href=\"https://www.scholarshipsforwomen.net/law/\">opportunities for women</a> and <a href=\"https://www.juriseducation.com/blog/law-school-scholarships-your-guide\">people of color</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262008/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rodney Coates does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Surveillance pricing has dominated headlines recently. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/07/16/delta-moves-toward-eliminating-set-prices-in-favor-of-ai-that-determines-how-much-you-personally-will-pay-for-a-ticket/\">Delta Air Lines’ announcement</a> that it will use artificial intelligence to set individualized ticket prices has led to widespread concerns about companies using personal data to charge different prices for identical products. As The New York Times reported, this practice involves companies tracking everything <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/business/dealbook/personalized-pricing.html\">from your hotel bookings to your browsing history</a> to determine what you’re willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The reaction has been swift. Democratic lawmakers have responded with outrage, with Texas Rep. Greg Casar <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/2025-07-23-first-ever-ban-surveillance-pricing-congress-greg-casar/\">introducing legislation to ban the practice</a>. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s new chair of the Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-ftc-chair-culture-wars/\">shut down public comment on the issue</a>, signaling that the regulatory pendulum may swing away from oversight entirely.</p>\n\n<p>What’s missing in this political back-and-forth is a deeper look at the economics. As a <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/aradhna-krishna\">business school professor</a> who researches pricing strategy, I think the debate misses important nuances. Opponents of surveillance pricing overlook some potential benefits that could make markets both more efficient and, counterintuitively, more equitable.</p>\n\n<h2>What surveillance pricing actually is</h2>\n\n<p>Surveillance pricing differs from traditional <a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-dynamic-pricing\">dynamic pricing</a>, where prices rise for everyone at times of peak demand. Instead, it uses personal data – browsing history, location, purchase patterns, even device type – to charge a unique price based on what algorithms predict you’re willing to pay. </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to discover each customer’s “reservation price” – the most they’ll pay before walking away. Until recently, this was <a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/429/augmenting_conjoint_analysis_to_estimate_consumer_reservation_price.pdf\">extremely difficult to do</a>, but modern data collection has made it increasingly feasible.</p>\n\n<p>An FTC investigation found that companies track <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-surveillance-pricing-study-indicates-wide-range-personal-data-used-set-individualized-consumer\">highly personal consumer behaviors</a> to set individualized prices. For example, a new parent searching for “baby thermometers” might find pricier products on the first page of their results than a nonparent would. It’s not surprising that many people think this is unfair. </p>\n\n<h2>The unintended progressive tax</h2>\n\n<p>But consider this: Surveillance pricing also means that wealthy customers pay more for identical goods, while lower-income customers pay less. That means it could achieve redistribution goals typically pursued through government policy. Pharmaceutical companies already do this globally, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0891\">charging wealthier countries more</a> for identical drugs to make medications accessible in poorer nations. Surveillance pricing could function as a private-sector <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/progressive-tax/\">progressive tax system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Economists call it “<a href=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination\">price discrimination</a>,” but it often helps poorer consumers access goods they might otherwise be unable to afford. And unlike government programs, this type of redistribution requires no taxpayer funding. When Amazon’s algorithm charges me more than a college student for the same laptop, it’s effectively running a means-tested subsidy program – funded by consumers.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWm2RdzxObc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">PBS NewsHour featured a segment on the Delta Air Lines news.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The two-tier economy problem</h2>\n\n<p>In my view, the most legitimate concern about surveillance pricing isn’t that it exists, but how it’s implemented. Online retailers can seamlessly adjust prices in real time, while physical stores remain largely stuck with uniform pricing. Imagine the customer fury if Target’s checkout prices <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-lawsuits-california-target-corp-35db1e4f1ea1d43ef7a1f7f2b4630c41\">varied by person based on their smartphone data</a>: There could be chaos in the stores. This digital-physical divide could also create unfair advantages for tech-savvy companies while leaving traditional retailers behind. That would raise fairness considerations for consumers as well as retailers. </p>\n\n<p>This is related to another force that could limit how far surveillance pricing can go: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/beating-the-opal-and-other-acts-of-everyday-arbitrage-35845\">arbitrage</a>, or the practice of buying something where it is cheaper and selling it where it is more expensive. </p>\n\n<p>If a system consistently charges wealthy customers $500 for items that cost poor customers $200, it creates opportunities for entrepreneurial intermediaries to exploit these price gaps. Personal shopping services, buying cooperatives or even friends and family networks could arbitrage these differences, providing wealthy customers access to the lower prices while splitting the savings. This means surveillance pricing can’t discriminate too aggressively – market forces will erode excessive price gaps.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I believe the solution isn’t to ban surveillance pricing entirely, but to monitor how it is put in practice. </p>\n\n<h2>The regulatory sweet spot</h2>\n\n<p>The current political moment offers a strange opportunity. With Republicans focused on AI innovation and Democrats fixated on bans, there’s space for a more sophisticated position that embraces market-based redistribution while demanding strong consumer protections.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, smart regulation would require companies to disclose when personal data influences pricing, and would prohibit discrimination based on <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/protected_characteristic\">protected characteristics</a> such as race, color or religion – and this list needs to be created extremely carefully. This would preserve the efficiency benefits while preventing abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Surveillance pricing based on desperation or need also raises unique ethical questions. Charging a wealthier customer more for a taxi ride is one thing; charging someone extra <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/uber-surge-pricing-phone-battery/\">solely because their battery is low</a> and they risk being stranded is another.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, the distinction between ability to pay and urgency of need must become the cornerstone of regulation. While distinguishing the two may seem challenging, it’s far from impossible. It would help if customers were empowered to report exploitative practices, using mechanisms similar to existing <a href=\"https://www.scag.gov/price-gouging/\">price-gouging protections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A solid regulatory framework must also clarify the difference between dynamic pricing and surveillance-based exploitation. Dynamic pricing has long been standard practice: Airlines charge all last-minute travelers higher fares, regardless of their circumstances. But consider two passengers buying tickets on the same day – one rushing to a funeral, another planning a spontaneous vacation. Right now, airlines can use technology to identify and exploit the funeral attendee’s desperate circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The policy challenge is precise: Can we design regulations that prevent airlines from exploiting the bereaved while still allowing retailers to offer discounts on laptops to lower-income families? The answer will determine whether surveillance pricing becomes a tool for equity or exploitation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266293/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Aradhna Krishna does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>When Starbucks announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/starbucks-is-discontinuing-mobile-order-and-pickup-only-stores\">phase out its mobile-order pickup-only locations</a> beginning in 2026, it raised a question: Why abandon a format seemingly built for speed and efficiency?</p>\n\n<p>As Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">explained the decision</a> in an earnings call, the pickup-only stores had a “transactional” feel, lacking “the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.” </p>\n\n<p>While Niccol also touted the mobile-order options at its traditional coffee shops, I see Starbucks’ move as an attempt to return to its roots as a “<a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/emea/stories/2024/reclaiming-third-places-our-bold-vision-for-community-stores\">third place</a>” – a destination between home and work where people can gather and connect. </p>\n\n<p>But this sort of pivot comes with trade-offs – and it creates interesting market opportunities for competitors. As a <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/vivek-astvansh\">marketing professor</a> and a coffee connoisseur, I’m offering this analysis to go with your morning cup of joe.</p>\n\n<h2>The two types of coffee shop patrons</h2>\n\n<p>In general, coffee shops attract two distinct customer segments. The first are what I call “stay-and-savor” customers – people who mostly use the site as a place to meet others or work. Their primary interest is in the space, not the mocha or muffins.</p>\n\n<p>The second are “grab-and-go” customers – people who want a consistent product, delivered efficiently. They don’t linger at the store, so the place is less important to them than convenience, speed and product quality. Think of the morning rush at your local coffee joint. </p>\n\n<p>Starbucks’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxLbVL8cpYY\">pickup-only stores</a>, branded as <a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/stores-and-ordering/pickup/\">Starbucks PICK UP</a>, cater to grab-and-go customers. If you don’t live in a busy area, you might never have heard of the brand: There are <a href=\"https://www.westsidecurrent.com/news/main-street-starbucks-in-santa-monica-among-locations-slated-for-closure/article_9e15a29b-8196-4955-b399-b18a8a411540.html\">fewer than 100</a> Starbucks PICK UPs, many in densely packed cities.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, there are about 17,000 <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Starbucks-USA/\">sit-in Starbucks stores</a> across the United States. That means its plan will affect just 0.5% of its locations. That’s not very much.</p>\n\n<p>So why does this change have me a little, well, steamed up?</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the third place, whether you like it or not</h2>\n\n<p>As I said before, I see this move as part of an effort <a href=\"https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2025/brian-niccol-and-howard-schultz-on-reclaiming-the-third-place-and-delivering-performance-through-the-lens-of-humanity/\">to emphasize “stay-and-savor” customers</a> over their “grab-and-go” counterparts. Indeed, Niccol’s recent earnings call presentation claimed that Starbucks is “<a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">prioritizing warmth, connection and community</a>.” Starbucks also publishes a document stating its “<a href=\"https://content-prod-live.cert.starbucks.com/binary/v2/asset/137-72999.pdf\">principles for upholding the third place</a>,” and its commitment seems to be more than just rhetorical.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that <a href=\"https://merchants.doordash.com/en-us/blog/profit-margins-restaurant-businesses\">coffee shops aren’t like regular restaurants</a> in terms of menu prices and customer spending. “Stay-and-savor” customers are costly to serve for coffee shops, and may generate insufficient revenue, making them <a href=\"https://merchants.doordash.com/en-us/blog/profit-margins-restaurant-businesses\">less profitable</a>. That could be bad for the bottom line.</p>\n\n<p>The change could also have unintended consequences for workers and customers. For example, pickup-only stores allow employees to focus on food and beverage preparation, with less pressure to engage in small talk in the hopes of generating warmth and tips. Indeed, much academic research has shown that restaurant workers who serve customers report more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2024.103955\">emotional labor and stress</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1265581\">and worse morale and well-being</a> than those who don’t.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Starbucks’ rivals, such as <a href=\"https://www.restaurantnewsresource.com/article72209.html\">Dunkin’</a> and the Chinese new entrant <a href=\"https://investor.luckincoffee.com/news-releases/news-release-details/luckin-coffee-announces-smart-unmanned-retail-strategy-bringing\">Luckin Coffee</a>, have embraced the grab-and-go customers. These rivals provide space for seating space, but they don’t elevate their positioning as if their baristas are serving warmth, connection and community. </p>\n\n<p>Starbucks CEO Niccol has described the plan as a “<a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">sunsetting</a>.” I’d watch out for Dunkin’ and Luckin Coffee, and of course, Starbucks’ financials in 2026, to determine whether the Starbucks sun sets or rises.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262591/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Vivek Astvansh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions. </p>\n\n<p>Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Corporations publish their pollution data</h2>\n\n<p>A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/epcra\">significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals</a> to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them.</p>\n\n<p>That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program\">Toxics Release Inventory</a>. That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/pollution-prevention-p2-and-tri\">cleaner methods</a> and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/introduction-2023-tri-national-analysis\">3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals</a> (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/releases-chemicals\">21% decrease from 2014</a>. The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases. </p>\n\n<p>The 2023 releases came from over <a href=\"https://awsgispub.epa.gov/trina2023/summary/#map\">21,600 industrial facilities</a> in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/states-and-metropolitan-areas\">Texas, Ohio and California</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"PxCgi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PxCgi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/releases-chemical-and-industry\">78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-021-00664-7\">economically disadvantaged, rural or minority</a> communities. </p>\n\n<p>But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">corporate characteristics</a> matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength.</p>\n\n<p>In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases</a> than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income.</p>\n\n<p>We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated.</p>\n\n<p>The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site.</p>\n\n<p>But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"wP87w\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wP87w/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The role of innovation</h2>\n\n<p>One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/searching-for-patents/helpful-resources/first-time-here/patent-families\">patent families</a>, which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample.</p>\n\n<p>We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment.</p>\n\n<h2>Size and profitability matter, too</h2>\n\n<p>We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns.</p>\n\n<p>We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"UUdKf\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UUdKf/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.</p>\n\n<p>Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/\">income statements obtained from PitchBook</a>, a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265227/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Callais</a>, with major implications for the Voting Rights Act, racial representation and Democratic Party power in congress.</p>\n\n<p>The central question in the case is to what extent race can, or must, be used when congressional districts are redrawn. Plaintiffs are challenging whether the longstanding interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, which requires protection of minority voting power in redistricting, violates the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection\">Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution</a>, which guarantees that individuals should be treated the same by the law. </p>\n\n<p>In short, the plaintiffs argue that the state of Louisiana’s use of race to make a second Black-majority district is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/supreme-court-louisiana-redistricting-voting-rights-act\">second time</a> that the court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-in-pivotal-case-on-the-voting-rights-act/\">after no decision was reached last term</a>. From my perspective as a <a href=\"https://www.simmons.edu/people/sam-hayes\">scholar of U.S. federal courts and electoral systems</a>, this case represents the collision of decades of Supreme Court decisions on race, redistricting and the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<h2>Long legal battle</h2>\n\n<p>To understand the stakes of the current case, it’s important to know what the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47520\">Voting Rights Act</a> does. Initially passed in 1965, the act helped end decades of racially discriminatory voting laws by providing federal enforcement of voting rights. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/election-law-explainers/section-2-of-the-voting-rights-act-vote-dilution-and-vote-deprivation/\">forbids discrimination by states</a> in relation to voting rights and has been used for decades to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>The current case has its roots in the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census\">redistricting of Louisiana’s congressional districts</a> following the 2020 Census. States are required to redraw districts each decade based on new population data. Louisiana lawmakers redrew the state’s six congressional districts without major changes in 2022.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Police smashing marchers on a street with billy clubs.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">State troopers in Selma, Ala., swing billy clubs on March 7, 1965, to break up a march by advocates for Black Americans’ voting rights.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Voting%20Rights%20Act%201965&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Soon after the state redistricted, a group of Black voters challenged the map in federal court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act.

Callais</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that the Louisiana legislature’s drawing of districts based on race in Senate Bill 8 was in violation of the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/\">14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause</a>, which requires equal treatment of individuals by the government, and the 15th Amendment, <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv\">which forbids denying the right to vote based on race</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the plaintiffs claimed that the courts’ interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional and that the use of race to create a majority-minority district is itself discriminatory. Similar arguments about the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause were also the basis of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">striking down race-based affirmative action in college admissions</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, a three-judge district court sided with the white plaintiffs in Louisiana v. Callais, with a 2-1 decision. The Black plaintiffs <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370938/20250827153950778_24-109%2024-110%20Louisiana%20v%20Callais%20et%20al%20Supplemental%20Brief%20for%20Robinson%20Defendants.pdf?inline=1\">from the original case</a>, and the state of Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370895/20250827134212077_Callais%20-%20Supplemental%20Opening%20Merits%20Brief.pdf?inline=1\">appealed the case to the Supreme Court</a>.

Callais, deciding that Louisiana’s congressional districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, it will have substantial impacts on minority representation. The decision would upend decades of precedent for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">For 39 years</a>, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has required redistricting institutions to consider racial and ethnic minority representation when devising congressional districts. <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Majority-minority_districts\">Majority-minority districting</a> is required when a state has large, compact and cohesive minority communities. Historically, some states have redistricted minority communities in ways that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act\">dilute their voting power, such as “cracking”</a> a community into multiple districts where they compose a small percentage of the electorate. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 also provides voters and residents with a legal tool that has been used to challenge districts as discriminatory. Many voters and groups have used Section 2 successfully to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 has been the main legal tool for challenging racial discrimination in redistricting for the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively ended the other major component of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, which required certain states to have <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/shelby-county-v-holder\">changes to their elections laws approved by the federal government</a>, including redistricting. </p>\n\n<p>If the court overrules the current interpretation of Section 2, it would limit the legality of using race in redistricting, end requirements for majority-minority districts and eliminate the most common way to challenge discriminatory districting.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, because of the strong relationship between many <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/\">minority communities and the Democratic party</a>, the court’s decision has major implications for partisan control of the House of Representatives. </p>\n\n<p>If Section 2 no longer required majority-minority districts, then Republicans could use the ruling to redraw congressional districts across the country to benefit their party. Politico reported that Democrats could <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/republicans-scotus-vra-00597212\">lose as many as 19 House seats</a> if the Supreme Court sides with the lower court. </p>\n\n<p>Recent Supreme Court precedent gives conflicting signals as to how it will decide this case. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the court rejected a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-in-unconstitutional-districts-us-supreme-court-upended-decades-of-precedent-in-2022-by-allowing-voters-to-vote-with-gerrymandered-maps-instead-of-fixing-the-congressional-districts-first-227124\">challenge to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> related to Alabama’s congressional districts. In 2024, the court overruled a lower court’s finding of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-rights-at-risk-after-supreme-court-makes-it-harder-to-challenge-racial-gerrymandering-232359\">racial vote dilution in South Carolina</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267269/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sam D.

During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create <a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/about/k-12-education/severe-weather/hurricane-simulation\">computer simulations to forecast</a> how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you’re trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating <a href=\"https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/research/theory-computational-methods/space-weather-modeling-framework/\">these simulations gets a little more complex</a>. To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the Sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place.</p>\n\n<p>Space weather is very different from the storms you see on Earth. These events come from the Sun, which ejects eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields from its surface. The most powerful of these events are called <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\">interplanetary coronal mass ejections</a>, or CMEs, which travel at speeds approaching 1,800 miles per second (2,897 kilometers per second). </p>\n\n<p>To put that in perspective, a single CME could move a mass of material equivalent to all the Great Lakes from New York City to Los Angeles in just under two seconds – almost faster than it takes to say “space weather.”</p>\n\n<p>When these CMEs hit Earth, they can <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms\">cause geomagnetic storms</a>, which manifest in the sky as beautiful auroras. These storms can also damage key technological infrastructure, such as by interfering with the flow of electricity in the power grid and causing <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/images/u33/finalBoulderPresentation042611%20%281%29.pdf\">transformers to overheat and fail</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Bands of colorful light in the night sky above a snowy ridge.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=330&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=330&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=330&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694899/original/file-20251007-81-4476iq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Geomagnetic storms, caused by space weather, produce beautiful light shows, but they can also damage satellites.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/aurora-arch-v-royalty-free-image/2030042283?phrase=aurora&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Frank Olsen, Norway/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To better understand how <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/5-geomagnetic-storms-reshaped-society\">these storms can wreak so much havoc</a>, our research team created simulations to show how storms interact with Earth’s natural magnetic shield and trigger the dangerous geomagnetic activity that can shut down electric grids. </p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adf855\">study published in October 2025</a> in the Astrophysical Journal, we modeled one of the sources of these geomagnetic storms: small, tornado-like vortices spun off of an ejection from the Sun. These vortices are called flux ropes, and satellites <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/1999GL010724\">had previously observed</a> small flux ropes – but our work helped uncover how they are generated. </p>\n\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\n<p>Our team started this research in summer 2023, when one of us, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oeyIipsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a space weather expert</a>, spotted inconsistencies in space weather observations. This work had found geomagnetic storms occurring during periods when no solar eruptions were predicted to hit Earth. </p>\n\n<p>Bewildered, the space weather expert wanted to know if there could be space weather events that were smaller than coronal mass ejections and did not originate directly from solar eruptions. He predicted that such events might form in the space between the Sun and Earth, instead of in the Sun’s atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>One example of such smaller space weather events is a magnetic flux rope – bundles of magnetic fields wrapped around each other like a rope. Its detection in computer simulations of solar eruptions would hint to where these space weather events may be forming. Unlike satellite observations, in simulations you can turn back the clock or track an event upstream to see where they originate.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NkQmnuCsGM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Sometimes the Sun ejects masses of plasma and magnetic field lines, called coronal mass ejections.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So he asked the other author, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l4z7PzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a leading simulation expert</a>. It turned out that finding smaller space weather events was not as simple as simulating a big solar eruption and letting the computer model run long enough for the eruption to reach Earth. Current computer simulations are not meant to resolve these smaller events. Instead, they are designed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRzID3ZNqY\">focus on the large solar eruptions</a> because these have the most effects on infrastructure on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>This shortfall was quite disappointing. It was like trying to forecast a hurricane with a simulation that only shows you global weather patterns. Because you can’t see a hurricane at that scale, you would completely miss it.</p>\n\n<p>These larger-scale simulations are known as global simulations. They study how solar eruptions form on the Sun’s surface and travel through space. These simulations treat streams of charged particles and magnetic fields floating through space as fluids to reduce the computational cost, compared with modeling every charged particle independently. It’s like measuring the overall temperature of water in a bottle, instead of tracking every single water molecule individually.</p>\n\n<p>Because these simulations are computational phenomena that happen across such a vast space, they can’t resolve every detail. To affordably resolve the vast space between the Sun and the planets, researchers divide the space into large cubes – analogous to two-dimensional pixels in a camera. In the simulation, these cubes each represent an area 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) wide, tall and across. That distance is equivalent to about 1% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. </p>\n\n<h2>The search begins</h2>\n\n<p>Our search began with what felt like hunting for a needle in a haystack. We were looking into old global simulations, searching for a tiny, transient blob – which would signify a flux rope – within an area of space hundreds of times wider than the Sun itself. Our initial search did not yield anything.</p>\n\n<p>We then shifted our focus to the simulations of the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/\">May 2024 solar eruption event</a>. This time, we specifically looked at the region where the solar eruption collided into a quiet flow of charged particles and magnetic fields, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-solar-storms-and-the-solar-wind-3-astrophysicists-explain-how-particles-coming-from-the-sun-interact-with-earth-264013\">called the solar wind</a>, ahead of it. </p>\n\n<p>There it was: a distinct system of <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2544/1/012002\">magnetic flux ropes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, our excitement was short-lived. We could not tell where these flux ropes came from. The modeled flux ropes were also too small to survive, eventually fizzling out because they became too small to resolve with our simulation grid. </p>\n\n<p>But that was the type of clue we needed – the presence of flux ropes at the location where the solar eruption collided with the solar wind.</p>\n\n<p>To settle the issue, we decided to bridge this gap and create a computer model with a finer grid size than those previous global simulations used. Since increasing the resolution across the entire simulation space would have been prohibitively expensive, we decided to only increase the simulation resolution along the trajectory of the flux ropes. </p>\n\n<p>The new simulations could now resolve features that spanned distances six times Earth’s 8,000-mile (or 128,000-kilometer) diameter down to tens of thousands of miles – nearly 100 times better than previous simulations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A comparison of low and enhanced simulation grid sizes.

The results were astonishing. </p>\n\n<p>The high-resolution view revealed that the flux ropes formed when the solar eruption slammed into the slower solar wind ahead of it.

I believe the cause is an issue called response error. It means that respondents don’t interpret a question in the way the researcher thinks they will. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the answers people provide don’t really reflect what the researcher thinks the answers show.</p>\n\n<p>For example, asking whether someone would support the use of force to achieve a political goal raises the question of what the respondent thinks “use of force” means in this context. It could be interpreted as violence, but it could also be interpreted as using legal means to “force” someone to do something. </p>\n\n<p>Such response errors have been a concern for pollsters <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_of_Asking_Questions/GPD_AwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">ever since survey research began</a>. They can affect even seemingly straightforward questions. </p>\n\n<h2>What did you mean by that?</h2>\n\n<p>To avoid this problem, I used an <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/products/engage/\">AI interviewing system</a> developed by <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/\">CloudResearch</a>, a well-known survey research company, to ask respondents some of the same questions about political violence from previous surveys. Then I used it to ask what they were thinking when they answered those questions. This process is called <a href=\"https://www.hkr.se/contentassets/9ed7b1b3997e4bf4baa8d4eceed5cd87/gordonwillis.pdf/\">cognitive interviewing</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I then used AI to go through these interviews and categorize them. Two short reports that summarize this process as applied to both polls are <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report.html\">available</a> <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report2.html\">online</a>. These analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the results should be considered very preliminary.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the results clearly demonstrate that respondents interpret these questions in very different ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Nuance matters</h2>\n\n<p>For example, in my survey, about 33% of Democrats agreed with the statement that “use of force is justified to remove President Trump from office.” However, when asked why they agreed, more than 57% gave responses like this: “I was not thinking physically but more in the sense that he – the president – might need to be ‘fired’ or forced out of office due to rules or laws.” Still others were envisioning future scenarios where a president illegally seizes power in a coup.</p>\n\n<p>Once you account for these different interpretations of the question, the AI only coded about 8% of Democrats as supporting use of force in violent terms under current conditions. </p>\n\n<p>Even here, there was substantial ambiguity – for example, this type of response was not unusual: “The language ‘use of force’ was a bit too broad for me. I could not justify killing Trump, for example, but less extreme uses of force were valid in my eyes.”</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, 29% of Republicans agreed that “use of the military is justified to stop protests against President Trump’s agenda.” However, almost all of the respondents who agreed with this statement envisioned the National Guard interceding nonviolently to stop violent protests and riots. Only about 2.6% of Republicans gave comments supporting use of the military against nonviolent protests.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all those who agreed that use of the military was justified expressed thoughts like this: “I see the military coming and acting as a police force to stop or prevent the demonstrations that become violent. Peaceful protesters must be allowed to exercise their right to free speech.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is political violence justified?</h2>\n\n<p>Even questions that explicitly ask about political violence are open to wide interpretation. Take, for example, this question: “Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to resort to violence in order to achieve political goals?” </p>\n\n<p>The lack of a specific scenario or location in this question invites respondents to engage in all kinds of philosophical and historical speculation. </p>\n\n<p>In my survey, almost 15% of respondents said violence could sometimes be justified. When asked about the examples they were thinking of, respondents cited the American Revolution, the anti-Nazi French Resistance and many other incidents as a reason for their responses. Only about 3% of respondents said they were thinking about actions in the U.S. at the current time.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, almost all respondents stated that violence should be a last resort when all other peaceful and legal methods fail.</p>\n\n<p>One respondent illustrated both problems with one sentence: “The (American) colonists tried petitions and negotiations first, but, when those efforts failed, they resorted to armed conflict to gain independence.”</p>\n\n<h2>A call for understanding</h2>\n\n<p>Even these numbers likely overestimate Americans’ support for political violence. I read the interviews, checking the AI system’s labeling, and concluded that, if anything, it was overestimating support for violence.</p>\n\n<p>Other factors may also be distorting reports of public support for political violence. Many surveys are conducted primarily online. One study estimated that anywhere from 4% to 7% of respondents in online surveys are “<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/assessing-the-risks-to-online-polls-from-bogus-respondents/\">bogus respondents</a>” who are selecting arbitrary responses. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2116870119\">Another study</a> reported that such respondents dramatically increase positive responses on questions about political violence.</p>\n\n<p>Respondents may also be willing to espouse attitudes anonymously online that they would never say or do in real life. Studies have suggested that “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/1094931041291295\">online disinhibition effects</a>” or “<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131087\">survey trolling</a>” can impact survey results.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, my preliminary research suggests that response error is a substantial problem in surveys about political violence. </p>\n\n<p>Americans almost universally condemn the recent political violence they have witnessed. The recent poll results showing otherwise more likely stem from confusion about what the questions are asking than actual support for political violence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266113/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Kennedy does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

For decades, scientists have demonstrated that even tiny differences in leg length between individual lizards can mean the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54302-1\">difference between life and death</a> – affecting their ability to escape predators, catch prey and find mates.</p>\n\n<p>Since subtle variations matter so much, biologists have long assumed that losing an entire limb should be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>Yet our global survey tells a different story about these remarkable survivors. Working with colleagues across six continents, we found limb-damaged lizards across nearly all major lizard families, from tiny geckos to massive iguanas.</p>\n\n<p>These animals had clearly healed from whatever trauma caused their injuries – likely accidents or the failed attempts of a predator to eat them. Perhaps most remarkably, we documented surviving limb loss even in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2009.07.001\">chameleons, tree-climbing specialists</a> whose movements seem to require perfect limb coordination.</p>\n\n<h2>Thriving, not just surviving</h2>\n\n<p>The body condition of these lizards was most surprising. Rather than appearing malnourished, many limb-damaged lizards were actually heavier than expected for their size, suggesting they were successfully finding food despite their handicap. Some were actively reproducing, with females found carrying eggs and males observed successfully mating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"4 side by side X-ray images in black and white of small lizards each missing a limb\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Limb damage can be fairly common in some lizard populations, such as these X-rays of brown anoles (<em>Anolis sagrei</em>) from the Bahamas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jason Kolbe/Jonathan Losos</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These findings force us to reconsider some basic assumptions about how evolution might work in wild populations.

Maybe sometimes limb length matters tremendously, while during other times – such as when food is abundant and predators are scarce – limb length matters less and three-legged lizards can flourish.</p>\n\n<p>These lizard survivors showcase the incredible solutions that millions of years of evolution have built into their biology. Rather than being passive victims of their injuries, these lizards may survive by actively choosing safer habitats or hunting strategies, using smart behavior to avoid situations where their disability would be a disadvantage.</p>\n\n<h2>Biological engineering in action</h2>\n\n<p>Our research combines old-fashioned natural history <a href=\"https://www.thestroudlab.com/\">observations with cutting-edge, biomechanical analysis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We use high-speed cameras and computer software that can track movement frame by frame to analyze running mechanics invisible to the naked eye.

To an untrained eye, a small piece of radium may look like a chip off a regular gray rock. But radium can invisibly emit radiation – energy and small fragments of itself – that you can’t feel, see or smell. And that invisible radiation can hurt you, without you even noticing right away. </p>\n\n<p>What’s going on with this silent threat that can stealthily damage your body in ways that can take years to reveal themselves? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chemistry.richmond.edu/faculty/kdonald/\">As a chemist</a>, I’m interested in what makes different elements safe to handle or hazardous. This dangerous release of radiation is called radioactivity, and even though its source may look unassuming, it can burn you or even give you diseases that don’t manifest for years.</p>\n\n<h2>Atoms and isotopes</h2>\n\n<p>Everything you see around you – your skin, rocks, the pages of books – is all made up of different combinations of <a href=\"https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/A00493\">extremely small particles called atoms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An atom has a small, dense center called the nucleus. Negatively charged particles called electrons move around the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, there are two types of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons.</p>\n\n<p>All atoms with the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">same number of protons in their nuclei</a> are <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/\">the same element</a>. Besides radium, some elements you may have heard of are carbon and oxygen. All carbon atoms have six protons and all oxygen atoms have eight protons. Radium atoms are much heavier – all radium atoms have 88 protons.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685623/original/file-20250814-56-wx5wyv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram showing a nucleus with two circles representing neutrons and two circles representing protons, with a + in the protons.

Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For instance, two carbon atoms would each have six protons, but one might have six neutrons while another could have seven or eight.</p>\n\n<p>The number of protons and neutrons packed together in the nucleus determines whether the nucleus of an isotope is stable or not. If the nucleus is not stable, problems can arise. </p>\n\n<h2>Radioactive decay</h2>\n\n<p>The nucleus of each atom wants to be stable, but only certain arrangements of protons and neutrons <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-isotopes\">make that possible</a>. The number of protons and neutrons do not have to be equal, but some combinations make for a happy, or stable, coexistence in the nucleus while others don’t.</p>\n\n<p>A nucleus with an unhappy mix of protons and neutrons might break down or deteriorate in some way.

It is that radiation – the high-energy particles and waves shooting out from the nucleus of unstable atomic nuclei – that can make you sick.</p>\n\n<p>There are different <a href=\"https://www.jove.com/science-education/v/11444/types-of-radioactive-emissions\">types of radioactive decay</a>.

Yet in 2024, the planet <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00010-9\">temporarily breached that threshold</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The term “tipping point” is often used to illustrate these problems, but apocalyptic messages can leave people feeling helpless, wondering if it’s pointless to slam the brakes. As a geoscientist who has studied the ocean and climate for over a decade and recently spent a year on Capitol Hill working on <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/news/meet-alexandra-phillips-stpfs-first-legislative-branch-fellow-climate-science\">bipartisan climate policy</a>, I still see room for optimism.</p>\n\n<p>It helps to understand what a tipping point is – and what’s known about when each might be reached.</p>\n\n<h2>Tipping points are not precise</h2>\n\n<p>A tipping point is a metaphor for runaway change. Small changes can push a system out of balance. Once past a threshold, the changes reinforce themselves, amplifying until the system transforms into something new.</p>\n\n<p>Almost as soon as “tipping points” entered the climate science lexicon — following Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 book, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” — scientists warned the public <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/441785a\">not to confuse global warming policy benchmarks with precise thresholds</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A tall glacier front seen from above shows huge chunks of ice calving off into Disko Bay.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Greenland ice sheet, which is 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick at its thickest point, has been losing mass for several years as temperatures rise and more of its ice is lost to the ocean.

Instead, different elements in the climate system have risks of tipping that increase with each fraction of a degree of warming.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the beginning of a slow collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which could <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/ice-sheet-quick-facts\">raise global sea level</a> by about 24 feet (7.4 meters), is one of the most likely tipping elements in a world more than 1.5 C warmer than preindustrial times. Some models place the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1449\">critical threshold at 1.6 C</a> (2.9 F). More recent simulations <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090471\">estimate runaway conditions at 2.7 C</a> (4.9 F) of warming.

Reports suggest employees <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/nationwide-flight-delays-loom-as-air-traffic-controllers-call-out-sick/\">have been calling in sick</a> in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/airlines-urge-patience-us-air-traffic-staffing-issues-continue-2025-10-10/\">thousands of flights delayed or canceled</a> since the shutdown began.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. asked <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/strzempkowski.1\">Brian Strzempkowski</a> and <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/dickman.49\">Melanie Dickman</a>, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.</em> </p>\n\n<h2>How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?</h2>\n\n<p>Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-workers-back-bay-shutdown-785eb776d2312d1f68f7e91961d0a93a\">created some uncertainty</a> around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2020/05/29/the-most-stressful-job-in-the-world-what-its-really-like-to-be-an-air-traffic-controller/\">most stressful jobs there is</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, there have been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/airports-face-delays-as-shutdown-deepens-air-traffic-control-staffing-woes\">reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick</a> in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the <a href=\"https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/news/us-shutdown-faa-training-airlines-warning/\">2018-2019 shutdown</a>, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills. </p>\n\n<p>In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers\">threatened to fire these “problem children</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>What does this mean for people about to take a flight?</h2>\n\n<p>Before the shutdown, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5544703-airport-delays-government-shutdown/\">there was already a critical shortage</a> of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.</p>\n\n<p>A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety.</p>\n\n<p>The air traffic control system <a href=\"https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/ap-this-redundant-aviation-safety-net-helps-keep-planes-safe-when-controllers-lose-contact/\">is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it</a> to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate. </p>\n\n<p>As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/EWR-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2014.pdf\">can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft</a> departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">capacity was limited</a> to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">was personally involved</a> in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a colorful plane flies near the top of an air traffic control tower\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CongressFAA/1336d24012c9446bbc4fee9d90918c07/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How does the US keep air travel safe?</h2>\n\n<p>On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/nas_ops/atcscc\">Air Traffic Control System Command Center</a>, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system. </p>\n\n<p>When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/air-traffic-controllers-working-pay-begin-call-sick/story?id=126289491\">recently reporting that no controllers were available</a>, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace. </p>\n\n<h2>Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">systemic problem with hiring</a> of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">FAA’s plan to utilize colleges</a> across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/fclassiles/2025-09/DOT_Shutdown_Plan_9.30.25.pdf\">limited funding</a> from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown <a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/faa-academy-okc-shutdown-air-traffic-control-trainees/68992559\">can remain for many months</a> after the government reopens.  </p>\n\n<h2>What’s the government doing to end the shortage?</h2>\n\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/07/01/bill-fix-air-traffic-control-system/83788771007/\">Congress authorized over US$12 billion</a> in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary Duffy <a href=\"https://www.executivegov.com/articles/dot-duffy-faa-prime-contractor-air-traffic-control\">is currently leading an effort</a> to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-administration-needs-another-19-billion-fully-revamp-air-traffic-control-2025-07-16/\">additional $19 billion investment</a> will be needed to complete the task.</p>\n\n<p><em>The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267093/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Melanie Dickman is a member-at-large of Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA)</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brian Strzempkowski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The area is so vast it can be seen from space, but most people have never heard of it. </p>\n\n<p>In recognition of its natural and cultural significance, the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1432/\">Okavango Delta</a> was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014. When I conducted <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/rel15121452\">research in the Okavango</a> in 2024, I witnessed both its natural beauty and the ebullient warmth of the people who live there.</p>\n\n<p>The health of the delta – and of 270 other natural sites across the globe – is the subject of the latest <a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2025.org/newsroom/all-news/escalating-climate-threats-invasive-alien-species-and-pathogens-leave-natural\">IUCN World Heritage Outlook</a>, a recurring wellness report on the planet’s most treasured natural places.</p>\n\n<p>The report’s findings are not dire, but they aren’t great, either. Many of these extraordinary places are increasingly at risk due to escalating climate change, invasive species, and a lack of consistent funding to protect them.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"ycosJ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ycosJ/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The outlook</h2>\n\n<p>Every few years, the <a href=\"https://iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> – a global contingent of more than 1,400 government agencies and private organizations focused on environmental conservation – evaluates the environmental and biological conditions at all UNESCO World Heritage sites selected for their natural significance.</p>\n\n<p>That includes the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1432/\">Okavango Delta in Botswana</a>, home to the world’s largest population of African elephants; the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/998/\">Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil</a>; the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1263/\">Socotra Archipelago in Yemen</a> with hundreds of species of birds and fish; the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1167/\">Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, Indonesia</a>; the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/998/\">Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil</a>, and <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/76/\">Everglades National Park, Florida</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The IUCN reports to UNESCO on each site’s <a href=\"https://worldheritageoutlook.iucn.org/more/faq\">current state and natural value</a>, the threats it faces, the effectiveness of its protection and management, and actions needed to secure its future. The IUCN rates each site’s status from “good” to “critical” as a way of tracking its conservation progress over time.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent report – the fourth in a <a href=\"https://worldheritageoutlook.iucn.org/\">series that began in 2014</a> – was presented at the IUCN World Conservation Congress on Oct. 11, 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the report documents a <a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2025.org/newsroom/all-news/escalating-climate-threats-invasive-alien-species-and-pathogens-leave-natural\">decline in the conditions of these remarkable places</a>. The proportion of World Heritage sites with a positive conservation outlook – “good” or “good with some concerns” – has dropped to 57% after remaining at <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/49134\">63% in 2014, 2017 and 2020</a>. In addition, the proportion of sites considered of “significant concern” or “critical” has increased in the last five years from 37% to 43%. Many of those are in Mesoamerica, Africa and South America, as well as the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diver swims near pale and white-colored formations on the ocean floor.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695705/original/file-20251010-56-sryymd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A marine biologist surveys bleached and dead coral on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/this-photo-taken-on-april-5-shows-marine-biologist-anne-news-photo/2147871248\">David Gray/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Threats from the natural world</h2>\n\n<p>The report identifies several key challenges affecting heritage sites. The most widespread conservation challenge the report identifies is climate change. </p>\n\n<p>Climate-related changes in biological conditions such as ocean acidity, salt concentrations, sediment buildup, droughts, flooding and groundwater flow, and variable temperatures are considered “high” or “very high” threats to 117 of the 271 heritage sites evaluated – 43% of them. </p>\n\n<p>One-third of the 50 World Heritage sites that contain glaciers will see those glaciers disappear by 2050, the report projects.</p>\n\n<p>Around the world, <a href=\"https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php\">coral reefs have been, and are still, bleaching</a> – turning white as the colorful organisms that build and inhabit them die off – affecting 30% of the 29 World Heritage-listed coral reef ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, invasive species are encroaching on World Heritage sites. For example, in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, <a href=\"https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/about-galapagos/conservation-challenges/invasive-species/\">invasive species like rats and feral cats</a> are considered one of the main causes of extinctions, including to the islands’ famous birds. In Australia’s Gondwana Rainforest, the last vestiges of an ancient plant and animal “<a href=\"https://www.wettropics.gov.au/living-museum\">living museum</a>” are retreating due to invading non-native species.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People walk along a path near the face of a large swath of white and blue ice.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Tourists view the face of the Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/august-2025-argentina-perito-moreno-tourists-look-out-over-news-photo/2228085187\">Romina Cruz/picture alliance via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Threats from people</h2>\n\n<p>Additional human pressures are also endangering these unique areas. Threats to these sites from the outside include logging and mining in the region, developing nearby land, diverting natural water flows, and polluting the air, water and land. Roughly two-thirds of the sites studied face at least some danger from human activities happening outside the sites’ formal boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the report says heritage sites need more financial support to be better able to respond to key threats. It finds that most lack consistent, long-term funding for staff salaries, ecosystem monitoring, and continued <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/document/221425\">maintenance of protection programs</a>. Chronic underfunding is the primary barrier to effective ecosystem management. Funding typically comes from organizations such as the World Heritage Fund or the <a href=\"https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/publications/gef-8-corporate-scorecard-june-2025\">Global Environment Facility</a>, an organization made up of 186 member countries, institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector that funds environmental projects worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The IUCN report warns that even effective initiatives may struggle in the long term without stronger regional, national and global support. That could include efforts like the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/984/\">Okavango’s Community Management for Protected Areas Conservation</a> program, which connects rural communities and conservationists to support both people and nature.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Armed people in camouflage clothing walk through a wooded area.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Members of the Lion Intervention Brigade conduct an anti-poaching patrol at Niokolo-Koba National Park, Senegal.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateSenegalIllegalBigCatTrade/93754acdb53249efb201a846cfc2f1d8/photo\">AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What is missing from the 2025 report?</h2>\n\n<p>There is good news, though. Targeted local action, such as <a href=\"https://iucnsos.org/projects/stopping-the-bleeding-increased-enforcement-capacity-for-thailands-thap-lan-national-park-to-address-rampant-rosewood-poaching/\">anti-poaching efforts</a> and local community involvement, have improved conditions at four sites in West and Central Africa, shifting their status from “critical” to “significant concern.”</p>\n\n<p>There is more to know about these sites and how they are faring. As a community-based conservation scholar, I recognize that while the major drivers of ecological decline can be gleaned from published research, specific causes of that decline are best learned on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>The outlook provides critical environmental trends, but it could be strengthened by including specifics based on quantitative, community-based monitoring, such as wildlife population surveys by local experts. For instance, at a conference I attended in 2024, a frog biologist from Botswana observed that, before her work, the previous frog study in that part of the delta was in 1980.</p>\n\n<p>While critical local and Indigenous knowledge is recognized in the report, it is largely excluded from assessments, both because weaving it with conventional scientific analysis is difficult or because communities may choose to protect certain knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The Okavango Delta is one of many World Heritage sites, living landscapes rich with local cultural value and global significance. Like many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13304\">remote heritage sites outside Europe and North America</a>, there is a lot that remains unknown about biodiversity in the Okavango. </p>\n\n<p>The report acknowledges that recognizing the relationship between people and the environment would also improve future assessments. Overall, it offers a clear picture of global conservation trends while also acknowledging local realities and successes: for the heritage sites across the planet, conservation succeeds when people and nature thrive together.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266548/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jessica Beaudette received dissertation funding from the American Association of University Women and Arizona State University for field research in Botswana. </span></em></p>",

And her courage in having participated in an unfair contest and in exposing Maduro’s fraud by <a href=\"https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2024-07-30-u1-e207888-s27061-nid286010-maria-corina-machado-publica-actas-votacion-poder\">publishing the true vote tallies</a> on the internet, surely made Machado stand out to the Nobel committee.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in making Machado the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html\">2025 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a>, organizers <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2025/machado/facts/\">stated they were recognizing</a> her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”</p>\n\n<p>But as a <a href=\"https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/sociology/people/david-smilde\">scholar of Venezuela’s political process</a>, I know that is only part of the story. Machado is in many ways a controversial pick, less a peace activist than a political operator willing to use some of the trade’s dark arts for the greater democratic good.</p>\n\n<h2>Joining a controversial list of laureates</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, many <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/here-are-the-most-controversial-noble-prize-winners-ever.html\">Nobel Peace Prize awards generate controversy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It has often been bestowed on great politicians over activists.

Similarly, former Palestinian Liberation Organization leader <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1994/summary/\">Yasser Arafat</a> and Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1978/begin/facts/\">Menachem Begin</a> were both awarded the prize, in 1994 and 1978 respectively, despite their past association with violent activities in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three men stand, two shaking hands.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Yitzhak Rabin – all Nobel Peace Prize laureates.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/yasser-arafat-henry-kissinger-and-yitzhak-rabin-at-unesco-news-photo/952432476?adppopup=true\">Duclos/Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Nobel Committee often seems to use these awards not to celebrate past achievements but to affect the future course of events. The nods to Begin and Arafat were, in this way, used for encouragement of the Middle East peace process. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, sometimes, the peace prize is seemingly bestowed as a sign of approval for a break from the past.</p>\n\n<p>Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/obama/facts/\">won his in 2009</a> despite only being nine months into his presidency. It was taken by many as a rejection of the previous presidency of George W. Bush, rather than recognition of Obama’s limited achievements at that time.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2016/santos/facts/\">Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos</a> was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just days after his peace plan was rejected in a referendum. In that instance, the committee seemed to want to give his efforts a push just after a major setback.</p>\n\n<h2>Democratic path or dark arts?</h2>\n\n<p>So what should be made of the Nobel Peace Prize committee’s decision to recognize opposition to Maduro now?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly Machado’s profile is ascendant. In her political career, she has participated in elections – winning a seat in the National Assembly in 2010 – but boycotted many more. She also boycotted negotiation processes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OxULhCJJEc\">suggesting instead that foreign intervention</a> was the only way to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023 she returned to the electoral path and steadfastly mobilized the Venezuelan population for opposition primaries and presidential elections, even after her <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/01/27/venezuela-s-supreme-court-disqualifies-opposition-leader-from-running-for-president_6469941_4.html\">candidacy was disqualified</a> by the government-controlled electoral authority, and innumerable other obstacles were put in her path. </p>\n\n<p>The campaign included spearheading caravans and events across the country at significant personal risk. </p>\n\n<p>However, much of her fight since then has been via less-democratic means.</p>\n\n<p>Machado has shunned local and regional elections suggesting there was no sense in participating until the government honored the results of the 2024 presidential election. She has also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-trump-support-maduro.html\">again sought international intervention</a> to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past year she has aggressively <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/05/us-intel-memo-undercuts-trump-claims-about-venezuelan-gang-00330542\">promoted the discredited theory</a> that Maduro is in control of the Tren de Aragua gang and is using it to invade the United States – a narrative <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/venezuela-and-us-edge-toward-war-footing-but-domestic-concerns-international-risks-may-hold-washington-back-266509\">gladly accepted and repurposed</a> by U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to being the expressed motivation for a U.S. military buildup off the coasts of Venezuela, this theory has also been the central justification cited by the Trump administration for using the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11269\">Alien Enemies Act</a> to deport, without due process, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">238 Venezuelan men to a horrific prison</a> in El Salvador.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A large painting of a man is held aloft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nicolas Maduro continues to loom large and rule Venezuela despite María Corina Machado’s efforts.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/pro-government-supporters-carry-a-drawing-of-president-of-news-photo/2229626580?adppopup=true\">Jesus Vargas/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Relations with Trump</h2>\n\n<p>The Nobel Peace Prize could help unify the Venezuelan opposition movement, which over the past year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/nx-s1-5389718/why-venezuelas-opposition-has-urged-voters-to-boycott-upcoming-regional-elections\">has begun to fray over differences in strategy</a>, especially with respect to Machado’s return to electoral boycotts. </p>\n\n<p>And it will certainly draw more international attention to Venezuelans’ struggle for democracy and could galvanize international stakeholders to push for change.</p>\n\n<p>What it will mean in terms of Trump’s relationship to Machado and Venezuela is yet to be seen. Her main connection with the administration is through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/nobel-trump-rubio-venezuela.html\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio</a>, who has aggressively represented her views and is pushing for U.S. military intervention to depose Maduro</p>\n\n<p>Awarding Machado the prize could strengthen Trump’s resolve to seek regime change in Venezuela. Or, if he feels snubbed by the Nobel committee after very vocally <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-would-have-been-an-unsuitable-choice-for-the-2025-nobel-peace-prize-but-he-may-be-a-more-serious-contender-in-2026-267067\">lobbying to be awarded</a> the peace prize himself, it could be a wedge between the U.S. president and Machado. </p>\n\n<p>Machado seems to understand this. After not mentioning him in her first statement after the award was announced, she has since mentioned him multiple times, even dedicating the prize to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5549522-trump-machado-nobel-peace-prize/\">both the Venezuelan people and Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/machado-congratulated-by-trump-dedicates-award-partly-to-him\">called to congratulate her</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A game changer? Perhaps not</h2>\n\n<p>To the degree that the Nobel Peace Prize is not just a model of change but a model for change, the decision to award it to Machado could conceivably affect the nature of Venezuela’s struggle against authoritarianism, leading her to continue to seek the restoration of democracy with a greater focus on reconciliation and coexistence among all Venezuelans, including the still politically relevant followers of the late Hugo Chávez.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the impact, it probably will not be game-changing. As we have seen with other winners, the initial glow of public recognition is quickly consumed by political conflict.</p>\n\n<p>And in Venezuela, there is no easy way to translate this prize into real democratic progress. </p>\n\n<p>While Machado and other Venezuelan democrats may have more support than ever among global democrats, Nicolás Maduro controls all of Venezuela’s institutions including the armed forces and the state oil company, which, even when sanctioned, provides substantial resources. Maduro also has forged <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/maduros-allies-who-backs-venezuelan-regime\">strategic alliances with China, Russia and Iran</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The only way one can imagine the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, with or without military action, is through an extensive process of negotiation, reconciliation, disarmament and justice that could lay the groundwork for coexistence. This Nobel Peace Prize could position Machado for this task.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267268/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Smilde does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Martinis</a> – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven.</p>\n\n<p>The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the <a href=\"https://quantum2025.org/\">100th anniversary</a> of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/\">precision measurement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/summary/\">laser technology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1952/summary/\">medical imaging</a> and, probably the most far-reaching of all, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/summary/\">semiconductor electronic devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/summary/\">computer chips</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings.</p>\n\n<h2>The promises of quantum machines</h2>\n\n<p>Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2012/summary/\">photons and atomic ions</a>, that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions.

Distant objects can manifest <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/press-release/\">quantum entanglement</a> – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. </p>\n\n<p>The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality?</p>\n\n<h2>Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit</h2>\n\n<p>In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0829-5\">affirmative answer</a> to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1913/summary/\">superconductors</a>. Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/summary/\">Cooper pair</a>. These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls.</p>\n\n<p>To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/summary/\">Josephson junction</a>, which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1908\">quantum tunneling</a>, where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1543\">quantized, values</a>, which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications and outlooks</h2>\n\n<p>The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.69.80\">distinct quantum phenomena</a> – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting artificial atoms</a> has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812\">quantum computers</a> using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting quantum bit</a>, or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters.

That has left market-watchers and monetary policymakers somewhat in the dark over key indicators in the U.S. economy.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers</a> is unaffected by the impasse in Washington and released its preliminary monthly report on Oct. 10, 2025; the final read of the month will be released in two weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. spoke with <a href=\"https://src.isr.umich.edu/research/faculty-profiles/profiles/joanne-hsu/\">Joanne Hsu</a>, the director of the Surveys of Consumers, on what the latest data shows about consumer sentiment – and whether the shutdown has left Americans feeling blue.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What is consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>Consumer sentiment is something that we at the University of Michigan have <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">measured since 1946</a>. It looks at American attitudes toward the current state of the economy and the future direction of the economy through questions on personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions for big-ticket items.</p>\n\n<p>Over the decades, it has been closely followed by policymakers, business leaders, academic researchers and investors as a leading indicator of the overall state of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>When sentiment is on the decline, consumers tend to pull back on spending – and that can lead to a slowdown in the economy. The opposite is also true: High or rising sentiment tends to lead to increased spending and a growing economy.</p>\n\n<h2>How is the survey compiled?</h2>\n\n<p>Every month, we interview a random sample of the U.S. population across the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Around 1,000 or so people take part in it every month, and we include a representative sample across ages, income, education level, demography and geography. People from across all walks of life are asked around 50 questions pertaining to the economy, personal finances, job prospects, inflation expectations and the like.</p>\n\n<p>When you aggregate that all together, it gives a useful measure of the health of the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<h2>What does the latest survey show?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">latest survey</a> shows virtually no change in overall sentiment between September and October. Consumers are not feeling that optimistic at the moment, but generally no worse than they were last month.</p>\n\n<p>Pocketbook issues – high prices of goods, inflation and possible weakening in the labor market – are suppressing sentiment. Views of consumers across the country converged earlier in the year when the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-sentiment-deteriorates-sharply-march-2025-03-14/\">Trump administration’s tariffs</a> were announced. But since then, higher-wealth and higher-income consumers have reported improved consumer sentiment. It is for lower-income Americans – those not owning stock – that sentiment hasn’t lifted since April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, we also saw a slight decline in inflation expectations, but it remains relatively high – midway between where they were around a year ago and the highs of around the time of the tariff announcements in April and May.</p>\n\n<h2>Has the government shutdown affected consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>The government shutdown was in place for around half the time of the latest survey period, which ran from Sept. 23-Oct. 6, 2025. And so far, we are not seeing evidence that it is impacting consumer sentiment one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>And that is not super-surprising. It is not that people don’t care about the shutdown, just that it hasn’t affected how they see the economy and their personal finances yet.</p>\n\n<p>History shows that federal shutdowns do move the needle a little. In 2019, around 10% of people spontaneously mentioned the then-shutdown in the January survey. We saw a <a href=\"https://sfa.senate.michigan.gov/Publications/EconInd/MEI_JAN19.pdf\">decline in sentiment</a> in that month, but it did improve again the following month.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, we tend to see stronger reaction to shutdowns when there is a debt ceiling crisis attached. In 2013, for example, there was a <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/11/shutdown-fears-drive-consumer-sentiment-to-9-month-low\">decline in consumer sentiment</a> coinciding with concerns over the debt ceiling being breached. But it did quickly rebound when the government opened again.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not we see a decline in sentiment because of the current shutdown depends on how long it lasts – and how consumers believe it will impact pocketbook issues, namely prices and job prospects.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267264/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanne Hsu receives research funding from NIA, NIH, and various sponsors of the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. </span></em></p>",

In 1858, a baby first named Hakadah, later called Ohíye S’a, who then became widely known as Charles Alexander Eastman for most of his adult life, was born near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. A Wahpeton Santee Dakota, he fled to Manitoba, Canada, with tribal members during <a href=\"https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/us-dakota-war\">the 1862 Dakota War</a> between the U.S. military and several bands of Dakota collectively known as the Santee Sioux.</p>\n\n<p>In December 1890, the two unexpectedly met each other while working at the <a href=\"https://history.sd.gov/archives/forms/indian%20archives/Indian%20Archives%20Project/pineridge.pdf?\">Pine Ridge Agency</a> in the newly declared state of South Dakota. Even more improbably, they fell in love. </p>\n\n<p>Just weeks later, booming Hotchkiss rifles 15 miles away signaled <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/native-american/disaster-at-wounded-knee/\">the start of the Wounded Knee Massacre</a>. Federal troops ended up killing at least 250 Lakota Sioux men, women and children; the traumatic event, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=a1fiNgoA_4cC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=wounded%20knee%20signaled&amp;f=false\">historian David Martínez writes</a>, sparked “the abrupt transformation of Indian nations from geopolitical powers … to symbols of conquest.”</p>\n\n<p>It also transformed Goodale and Eastman’s nascent relationship: They resolved to marry and to work together for Native American causes.</p>\n\n<p>Wounded Knee, however, would also prove an unfortunate metaphor for their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>In the research for my new dual biography, “<a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837915/love-and-loss-after-wounded-knee/\">Love and Loss After Wounded Knee: A Biography of an Extraordinary Interracial Marriage</a>,” I dove into letters, photographs and hundreds of newspaper articles documenting this high-profile, late-19th-century relationship. </p>\n\n<p>I came to understand that their marriage failed not only because of interpersonal tensions and a clash of values, but also because of some of the ways in which ideas about gender, race and Indigenous identity were rapidly changing in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>From writer to teacher</h2>\n\n<p>At 13, Goodale started publishing poetry in <a href=\"https://www.carnegielibrary.org/st-nicholas-magazine/\">St. Nicholas Magazine</a>, a popular children’s periodical. Her poems generated attention from the press, in addition to fan mail from notable men of letters, including <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/henry-wadsworth-longfellow\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. By the time she was 20, she had published five books. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of young woman.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Elaine Goodale Eastman in 1890, when she worked as the Supervisor of Education for the Dakotas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">South Dakota Historical Society</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But because poets without family fortunes needed other means to support themselves – and because women in the late 1800s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/hwj/23.1.59\">had few career options</a> – Goodale turned to teaching. She accepted a job at Virginia’s <a href=\"https://home.hamptonu.edu/about/history/\">Hampton Institute</a>, a boarding school that was founded to teach newly emancipated Black students. It later became part of the government’s program to assimilate Native Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Goodale became convinced that Indigenous children would benefit more from schools in their own communities, rather than at government- or church-run boarding schools. She traveled to <a href=\"https://www.history.nd.gov/archives/stateagencies/dtrecords.html\">the Dakota Territory</a> and opened a day school. She also turned from poetry to prose, documenting her observations of “Indian life and education” in dozens of articles. </p>\n\n<p>By the time she came to Pine Ridge Agency, the administrative offices at the Oglala Lakota Indian Reservation, she had been appointed the first supervisor of education for the Dakotas.</p>\n\n<h2>The ideal ‘assimilated Indian’</h2>\n\n<p>Ohíye S’a’s early years were marked by family trauma and U.S. government policies aimed at seizing land and displacing and assimilating Native people.

He was convinced that only a formal English-language education could provide a path forward for Native people.</p>\n\n<p>At his father’s urging, Ohíye S’a became “Charles Eastman,” and he also converted to Christianity. He attended a series of boarding schools before <a href=\"https://archive.dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/article/1984/10/1/ohiyesa-a-winner-lost-is-found\">landing at Dartmouth College</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/if_you_knew/ifyouknew_11.html\">Boston University Medical School</a>. </p>\n\n<p>His white mentors saw Eastman – the only Native person in his class at either institution – as the ideal “assimilated Indian.” His achievements often appeared in newspapers with headlines like “He’s a Winner: Sioux Indian Who Got a Boston University Degree,” an allusion to the fact that “Ohíye S’a” translated to “winner.”</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t clear whether Eastman ever thought of himself in that way. But throughout his life, he straddled the world in which he was raised and the one in which he was educated. His first job, as agency physician at Pine Ridge, placed him at the nexus of these two cultures.</p>\n\n<h2>An unlikely pair, a media sensation</h2>\n\n<p>After the shots rang out near Wounded Knee Creek, Eastman’s medical education was put to the test.

His eyes are small and glittering, his face and nose are broad and his cheek bones very pronounced,” according to the San Francisco Examiner.</p>\n\n<p>This type of media coverage – highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles’ backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways – would dog them throughout their marriage.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional travails, personal problems</h2>\n\n<p>Charles attempted to set up his own medical practice in St. Paul, Minnesota. But white patients proved reluctant to see “an Indian doctor,” while Native patients were hesitant to patronize a physician dispensing unfamiliar medicines. The practice failed.</p>\n\n<p>Financial pressures increased over the next decade as Elaine and Charles became parents of six children. They moved frequently: Charles took on a series of jobs, including recruiting for the YMCA, lobbying on behalf of the Santee Sioux, and working as an “outing agent” at <a href=\"https://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu/\">the Carlisle Indian Industrial School</a>, which involved finding summer placements for Native students with white families in a further attempt to Americanize them. </p>\n\n<p>Because Charles left behind few personal papers, it’s difficult to know if he believed in this program. But it’s easy to see how it could have created an identity crisis of sorts. </p>\n\n<p>At other points in his life, Charles seemed to put his Dakota identity front and center. For example, he was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians, an organization that worked on behalf of self-determination for Native Americans. He even served as its president in 1918. Meanwhile, his wife remained a staunch believer in assimilation.</p>\n\n<p>At Elaine’s urging – and likely, under her editorial stewardship – Charles began publishing stories and then books about his “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/337/337-h/337-h.htm\">Indian Boyhood</a>.” While Elaine continued writing and was able to publish a few books, his literary career took off and hers stalled out.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Cursive text.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A signature from a copy of one of Charles Eastman’s books, in which he uses both his Christian name and his Native American name, Ohíye S’a.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Charles_Eastman_Signature.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even their children weren’t spared from the headlines.

Other times he posed <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Charles_Eastman_(Ohiyesa).jpg\">in traditional Sioux regalia</a>. Often the coverage of his talks focused more on what he was wearing than the content of his lecture. Historian <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/kvigil\">Kiara Vigil</a> suggests that Charles knew that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=G03zCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=eastman#v=snippet&amp;q=eastman&amp;f=false\">his dress functioned as an advertisement for his work</a>, arguing that his choice of attire was strategic: “Eastman’s ability to dress up as an Indian, or not, enabled him to address diverse audiences and their expectations.”</p>\n\n<p>He was away from home more than he was present, further fueling Elaine’s resentment. In personal letters, she described her bitterness at Charles leaving the children and household to her sole care, and her belief that he was reinforcing the gender roles she’d railed against. While she certainly understood that his posing in buckskin and feathered headdress was good marketing, she probably never realized what reclaiming his Indigenous identity meant to Charles; she, too, thought of him as the product of successful assimilation.</p>\n\n<h2>It all falls apart</h2>\n\n<p>The personal and professional pressures on the Eastmans continued through the early years of the 20th century. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">They reached a breaking point after their second daughter</a>, Irene Taluta, died in the 1918 influenza pandemic.

These <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#eligibility\">are colleges</a> where at least 25% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic or Latino.</p>\n\n<p>This is more than a legal technicality. It reflects the Justice Department’s position that HSI grants violate constitutional protections, putting millions of federal dollars for these schools at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Citing this legal rationale, the Department of Education confirmed in September that it had frozen <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">US$350 million in education grants</a> intended for <a href=\"https://cmsi.gse.rutgers.edu/content/what-are-msis\">Minority-Serving Institutions</a>. This includes more than $250 million for HSIs, specifically.</p>\n\n<p>The Education Department argues that these programs amount to racial discrimination because they tie <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">federal grants</a> to students’ racial or ethnic backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>This echoes <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">the Supreme Court’s decision</a> in 2023, which narrowed how colleges can consider race and ethnicity in admissions.</p>\n\n<p>I serve as the university diversity officer at California State University, Chico, an HSI.

This amendment authorizes federal grants to help strengthen colleges that enroll large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students, providing more opportunity for those students to succeed and graduate. </p>\n\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/research/publications/hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis\">600 federally designated HSIs</a> across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. California is home to the most HSIs, with 167, followed by Texas, Puerto Rico, New York and Illinois. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to showing that at least 25% of its student population is Hispanic or Latino, any college or university that wants to qualify as an HSI must also show that at least half of its students come from <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ope/idues/eligibility-infographic.pdf\">low-income backgrounds</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an HSI allows colleges and universities to apply for federal funding intended to support underrepresented and low-income students.</p>\n\n<h2>HSIs vary in size and mission</h2>\n\n<p>HSIs enroll over <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/newsroom/over-600-colleges-and-universities-are-now-hispanic-serving-institutions,-enrolling-nearly-one-third-of-all-undergraduates\">1.5 million Hispanic students</a>, which amounts to over 60% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>This marks a big increase from the 340,000 Hispanic undergraduates who attended an HSI in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these schools are large public research universities, such as University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Santa Cruz. Others are regional institutions, private colleges and local community colleges. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, another kind of Hispanic-Serving Institution has emerged – research-intensive HSIs. These are colleges and universities where at least 25% of the student body is Hispanic and where there is significant research funding and a range of doctoral programs offered. These schools include University of California, Irvine; Florida International University; and the University of Texas at El Paso, <a href=\"https://www.hsru.org/\">among others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers <a href=\"https://www.equityinhighered.org/resources/ideas-and-insights/defining-servingness-at-hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis-practical-implications-for-hsi-leaders/\">have debated</a> whether the HSI category has become too broad, grouping schools with vastly different resources, missions and student populations. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their differences, <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12027/becoming-hispanic-serving-institutions?srsltid=AfmBOooRB0hS5b9YieGd3ENAMJwdlOQ2QzVxmCewbFgDjykctW1KBLgH\">many HSIs</a> enroll large numbers of first-generation, low-income and working students, as well as immigrants and transfer students. </p>\n\n<p>HSIs also generally operate with fewer financial and academic resources than comparable non-HSI institutions.</p>\n\n<h2>How HSI funding works</h2>\n\n<p>Title V grants from the Department of Education are one clear way that <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v\">HSIs can receive federal funding </a>. </p>\n\n<p>These competitive grants are intended to help HSIs expand educational opportunities and institutional capacity to support Hispanic and low-income students.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than providing aid directly to students, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#past-awards\">Title V grants</a> are used to offer faculty training, update classrooms and laboratories, create new degree programs and develop mentorship opportunities for first-generation students.</p>\n\n<p>At campuses such as California State University, Chico and University of California, Irvine, Title V grants have given schools the money to create bilingual advising services and maintain data systems.</p>\n\n<p>Title V grants form only one part of the <a href=\"https://hacu.net/advocacy/hsi-funding/\">broader funding picture for HSIs</a>. Like many colleges, HSIs rely on state funding and tuition revenue. They also compete for other federal grants, including those from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture. </p>\n\n<h2>How HSIs help Hispanic students</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1538192717734289\">A growing body</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23328584221148421\">of research</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1538192710391801\">shows that</a> HSIs are crucial in helping more Hispanic and first-generation students attend and graduate college. </p>\n\n<p>Some HSIs have received national recognition <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/seal-excelencia/seal-excelencia-certified-institutions\">for using evidence-based practices</a> to help Hispanic students perform better in the classroom. Hispanic students at these schools, which include Arizona State University and California State University, Fullerton, graduate at rates roughly 8 percentage points higher than Hispanic students nationally. </p>\n\n<p>Hispanic students at HSIs graduate at rates more than 5 percentage points higher than those at comparable non-HSI colleges, according to <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Latino_Success_Report_Final_HR.pdf\">similar 2017 findings</a> from the nonprofit Education Trust. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12712/transforming-hispanic-serving-institutions-equity-and-justice?srsltid=AfmBOopX2-psJ79B5ryNHaalD0B1Ea3lFXTZN9pplW3C6SzPwYLTHUxp\">There are a few reasons why</a> there is a relatively high graduation rate for Hispanic students at HSIs. </p>\n\n<p>Students at HSIs often report feeling a strong sense of belonging and see their own cultures reflected in the curriculum.

In the United States, acts of private political violence <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/rising-threat-anti-government-domestic-terrorism-what-data-tells-us\">against members of government</a> and <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/which-groups-have-experienced-an-increase-in-hate-crimes/\">against ordinary people</a> have both increased dramatically in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Political assassinations are the most vivid form of political violence.

The linkage of extremist speech to lethal violence has prompted calls to legally <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol31/iss1/4\">restrict or punish extremist speech</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Political violence, free speech and cultural editing</h2>\n\n<p>The First Amendment, however, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/\">protects extremist speech</a>, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/886/\">including advocacy of violence</a>. Violent rhetoric must <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/\">actually incite</a> or <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/22-138/\">threaten violence</a> to lose the First Amendment’s shelter.</p>\n\n<p>If law cannot curb the sorts of speech that may inspire political violence, what about social norms – widely shared beliefs about what speech is socially acceptable or appropriate?</p>\n\n<p>Much speech that the First Amendment protects from government regulation eventually disappears from public discourse. That happens through a process I call “cultural editing”: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2024.101974\">popular and institutional rejection of outmoded or repellent ideas</a>. For example, no serious medical conference discusses <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2022/04/10-strange-medical-practices-from-history/\">treating hay fever with cocaine</a>, and no respectable political science panel includes Nazis.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yCu21pL73s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=118\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a social media post after Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Donald Trump blamed ‘radical left’ rhetoric for political violence.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s blaming of the Kirk assassination on “radical left” rhetoric points toward a deeper level of cultural editing. </p>\n\n<p>Trump and other conservatives have not cited speech that advocated violence against Kirk. Instead, some conservative activists, spurred on by Trump administration officials, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/jd-vance-doxing-charlie-kirk-critics\">called for harassing and punishing critics</a> of Kirk’s statements and actions. </p>\n\n<p>But such criticisms of Kirk, whatever their merits or lack thereof, fall within the scope of ordinary political debate.  </p>\n\n<p>Kirk was not a government official, but he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/charlie-kirk-republicans-trump-politics.html\">strong influence in the Trump administration</a>. Robust democratic discourse <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/\">requires space for people to criticize</a> such powerful figures. Large-scale cultural editing of those criticisms, amounting to suppression of left-leaning views, would hurt the public’s ability to discuss and resolve political disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>However, Trump and others who push for suppressing harsh political rhetoric might argue that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-believe-harsh-political-rhetoric-is-fueling-violence-reutersipsos-poll-2025-09-16/\">the stakes of verbal attacks have increased</a>. They might say that U.S. political culture can no longer indulge political invective because political violence has become more common. </p>\n\n<h2>Political violence and guns</h2>\n\n<p>That argument for suppressing harsh political speech ignores an independent cause of political violence: gun proliferation.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/report/the-role-of-guns-in-rising-political-violence/\">Most political violence in the U.S. involves guns</a>. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/11/Charlie-Kirk-Trump-political-violence-guns/\">Guns make political violence easier</a> by erasing the distance between extremist ideas and lethal action. Hate or fanaticism can end a life in an instant, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/09/11/how-the-shooting-of-charlie-kirk-unfolded/\">hundreds of yards from the victim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has by far <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-ownership-by-country\">the highest number of civilian guns and rate of civilian gun ownership</a> in the world. Since 2008, when <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/\">the Supreme Court declared</a> an individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, annual U.S. gun purchases have increased <a href=\"https://americangunfacts.com/gun-ownership-statistics/\">from about 9 million</a> to <a href=\"https://www.safehome.org/data/firearms-guns-statistics/\">about 16 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Governments often find <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/564/786/\">regulating speech easier</a>, even though less effective, than tackling underlying problems. At times, federal and state governments have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/467528\">addressed political violence by regulating guns</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750656174/the-u-s-once-had-a-ban-on-assault-weapons-why-did-it-expire\">1994 federal assault weapons ban</a> exemplifies regulatory efforts to curb overall gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>But the Supreme Court’s Second Amendment cases <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/\">now appear to bar strong gun regulations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People in a democratic society need freedom to make harsh, even extreme political statements with a minimum of cultural editing. The Second Amendment protects access to lethal weapons. This combination of free speech and gun rights makes the growing problem of political violence much harder to solve.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265223/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gregory P.

These MOFs could allow for sensor technologies that make workplaces, the environment and human bodies safer.</p>\n\n<h2>What are MOFs, and why do they matter?</h2>\n\n<p>MOFs are made by linking metal ions – atoms that carry an electrical charge – with organic molecules, the carbon-based building blocks found in most living things.

Depending on how they’re structured, some have so much internal surface area that a single gram could cover a football field.</p>\n\n<p>This sponge-like porosity – meaning lots of tiny holes inside – lets MOFs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1230444\">trap and release gases</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chempr.2023.09.009\">store energy-rich fuels</a> like hydrogen, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">capture harmful pollutants</a>. MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules.</p>\n\n<p>These features have already inspired potential uses such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">capturing carbon dioxide from the air</a> to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">pulling clean water</a> from humid air, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D4RA04441J\">delivering medicines inside the body</a>. Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr200324t\">for sensing and detection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Atq5z5AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">our team</a> <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/rex-gerald/\">of engineers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz8jKuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">has been developing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iYkrD9IAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN\">MOF-based sensors</a> that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>From a storage material to a sensing material</h2>\n\n<p>When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-chemistryprize2025-1.pdf\">tiny framework changes</a> ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. </p>\n\n<p>By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output.</p>\n\n<p>Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. </p>\n\n<p>This crystal-fiber combination worked as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19775\">a tiny device</a> that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3094092\">picked up these changes</a>, allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. </p>\n\n<p>Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification.</p>\n\n<p>In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371551\">diabetic ketoacidosis</a>, allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695515/original/file-20251009-56-jqsqqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A photo showing a tube-like device, and a person exhaling into it out of their nose.

Ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers.</p>\n\n<p>Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.5c00982\">we developed</a> a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.128608\">allowing it to detect gases</a> with remarkable sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity.</p>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal.</p>\n\n<p>These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors.</p>\n\n<h2>Toward real-world impact</h2>\n\n<p>The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100348\">degrade under humidity or heat</a>, though some research groups are looking into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">how to make them more stable</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b00937\">human breath monitoring</a>, where subtle changes in exhaled gases <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177518\">provide early clues</a> to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers are working to embed MOFs into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">flexible films</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-022-2226-6\">printed circuits and wireless devices</a>. With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale.</p>\n\n<p>If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267103/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jie Huang receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rex Gerald receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bohong Zhang and Chen Zhu do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n\n<p>In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship.</p>\n\n<p>But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBPxHqkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8abR970AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and</a> our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom.</p>\n\n<p>Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"three men drink wine at cafe table with bill on it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/three-men-look-at-a-bill-in-a-cafe-and-divide-royalty-free-image/1312208692\">tim scott/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A focus on what friends give you</h2>\n\n<p>The traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_3\">social exchange theory of friendship</a> views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2008.00499.x\">what kinds of friendships to pursue</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2017.0737\">how to treat your friends</a>. It’s even <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/blog/social-exchange-theory\">made its way into pop psychology</a> self-help spaces.</p>\n\n<p>We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. </p>\n\n<h2>Less accounting, more supporting</h2>\n\n<p>Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216308098798\">likely to support their friends</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075241243341\">what they want in a friend</a>, they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective.</p>\n\n<p>People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met.</p>\n\n<p>Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2023.112120\">ranked higher in importance</a> than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, friendship <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015227414929\">isn’t always positive</a>. Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. </p>\n\n<h2>Friendship is more than the sum of its parts</h2>\n\n<p>But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of <a href=\"https://www.humangenerosity.org/\">The Human Generosity Project</a>, a cross-disciplinary research collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15800-2_4\">across societies</a>, from “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/646235\">kere kere” in Fiji</a> to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.22\">tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda</a>.

People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able.</p>\n\n<p>These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals.</p>\n\n<p>When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">environments are volatile</a> and when they ask those most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.12.003\">likely to be able to help</a>. These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">keeping track of debts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events.</p>\n\n<p>And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges</a> such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">this same pattern</a> in an online study of U.S.-based participants.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">branding cattle</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">paying bills</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat</h2>\n\n<p>What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange.</p>\n\n<p>What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258549/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Athena Aktipis receives funding from the National Science Foundation.

People with too few or defective Treg cells <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12170\">often develop autoimmune diseases</a>, where unchecked immune cells mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues or organs. Yet when Treg cells become too numerous, people can become <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14069\">more susceptible to cancer</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-387827-4.00003-6\">and infections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, Treg cells are often described as a double-edged sword. Treg cells also control internal revolt in the form of an overactive immune response by other immune cells that can trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772\">arthritis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789\">lupus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269\">multiple sclerosis</a> – diseases that develop when Treg cells are defective in either number, function or both.  </p>\n\n<p>The well-established functions of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections have recently been complemented by research unraveling how environmental factors influence these cells and modulate the immune response.</p>\n\n<p>We are a husband-wife team of immunologists who study how environmental factors such as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jJVj3sUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">chemicals, diet and gut bacteria</a> affect Treg cells and the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=af7TahQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">overall functioning of the immune system</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While our study dating back to 1984 found that certain environmental contaminants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008X(84)90261-8\">induce T cells that suppress the immune system</a>, further study on such cells was hampered by an inability in the field at large to isolate and characterize these cells. The discoveries honored by this year’s Nobel Prize transformed how researchers understand the immune system. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Nobel-Prizing winning scientist showing extreme emotion.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One of the three Nobel Prize-winning researchers, Mary E.

This constitutes one of the mechanisms through which certain environmental chemicals promote cancer by enhancing Treg activity and suppressing the anti-cancer immune response.  </p>\n\n<p>Air pollution, such as diesel exhaust, can have the opposite effect, impairing Treg cell function and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.08.008\">contributing to inflammatory diseases such as asthma</a>.

Compounds known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-023-03031-4\">indoles, found in vegetables from the cabbage family</a> such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1501727\">can activate Treg cells and help prevent gut inflammation</a>. These compounds also work by stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which boosts Treg numbers and activity. </p>\n\n<p>Another way diet can influence Treg cells is through the regulation of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hangry-bacteria-in-your-gut-microbiome-are-linked-to-chronic-disease-feeding-them-what-they-need-could-lead-to-happier-cells-and-a-healthier-body-199486\">the microbes that live in the gut</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms16047493\">gut has trillions of microbial residents, both benefical and harmful</a>. Previous research found that Treg cells in the gut <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.600973\">play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis</a> – the dynamic balance between microbiota and immune cells found in the gut. Any disturbance leading to loss of Treg cell function can lead to hyperactivation of other immune cells in the gut. This can trigger <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">inflammation</a> in which the immune cells destroy the lining of the intestine, leading to conditions such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8813558\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other naturally occurring substances – such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02267\">naringenin</a>, a chemical abundant in citrus fruits, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2011.04.009\">epigallocatechin-3-gallate</a>, a compound found in green tea – also activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote Treg development.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fiber-is-your-bodys-natural-guide-to-weight-management-rather-than-cutting-carbs-out-of-your-diet-eat-them-in-their-original-fiber-packaging-instead-205159\">fiber-rich diet</a> supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This bacteria ferments fiber into <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-019-00057-5#\">short-chain fatty acids that enhance Treg cell function</a> and help maintain gut health. Probiotic bacteria also increases Treg cell populations, thereby reducing inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, dietary tryptophan – an amino acid found in foods such as poultry, eggs, tofu and seeds – is metabolized into compounds that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092846\">activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor</a>, further boosting Treg cell activity and protecting against gut inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, a Western diet high in fat, sugar and processed foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2024.101923\">disrupts the balance of gut bacteria</a>. This, in turn, reduces the population of microbes that support Treg cells and promotes a more inflammatory environment in the gut.</p>\n\n<h2>Keeping Treg cells in harmony</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists like us and many others are working to understand the processes involved in maintaining the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06880\">delicate balance of Treg cells</a> that are influenced by all of these outside factors. The goal is to learn how Treg cells and other immune cells can be kept in equilibrium – strong enough to defend against infections and cancer yet restrained enough to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. </p>\n\n<p>The profound environmental influence on Treg cell development and function makes understanding these interactions crucial for defining the fine line between health and disease.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266865/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Prakash Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.  </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mitzi Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p>",

Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death.</p>\n\n<p>While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What to expect this flu season</h2>\n\n<p>Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see <a href=\"https://www.idse.net/Influenza/Article/10-25/CDC-Classifies-Upcoming-Flu-Season-as-Moderate-but-Vaccination-Still-Key/78478\">a moderate level of flu cases</a>, partly because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.17484\">last year’s flu activity was high</a> and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. </p>\n\n<p>However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been <a href=\"https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/worrying-signs-as-peak-flu-season-draws-near\">more severe than in years past</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm\">children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. <a href=\"https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/articles/antigenic-drift-vs-antigenic-shift-311044\">Because flu viruses mutate frequently</a>, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/influenza-inactivated.html\">best protection against severe illness</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">will be trivalent</a> – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A family, mom, dad and two young children all sit in bed together blowing their noses.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/sick-flu-and-family-on-a-bed-tissue-and-blowing-royalty-free-image/1575862747\">Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Vaccine availability</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-will-approve-covid-19-vaccine-only-for-older-adults-and-high-risk-groups-a-public-health-expert-explains-the-new-rules-257226\">Recent vaccine policy changes</a> have created some confusion, particularly around <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-with-new-restrictions-potentially-limiting-access-for-healthy-children-264098\">COVID-19 vaccines</a>. Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost.</p>\n\n<p>The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu-vaccination/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot-this-year\">cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor</a> for the flu by about half.</p>\n\n<p>Vaccination helps <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.004\">reduce the severity of illness</a>, the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html\">at the same time as other vaccines</a>, such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status.</p>\n\n<h2>Who should get the flu shot</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html\">everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year</a>, with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073620\">the American Association of Pediatrics</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The flu vaccine is especially important for:</p>\n\n<p>• Adults 65 and older</p>\n\n<p>• Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2</p>\n\n<p>• Pregnant people</p>\n\n<p>• People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease</p>\n\n<p>• Health care workers and caregivers</p>\n\n<p>Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated <a href=\"https://www.renown.org/blog/slow-the-spread-of-the-flu-with-herd-immunity\">protects not only you but also those around you</a> who may be more vulnerable.</p>\n\n<h2>Practical prevention tips</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses:</p>\n\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.nfid.org/washyourhands-to-help-prevent-disease/\">Wash your hands frequently</a> with soap and water. </p>\n\n<p>• Cover your coughs and sneezes.</p>\n\n<p>• Stay home if you’re feeling unwell.</p>\n\n<p>• Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough.</p>\n\n<p>Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-should-you-get-the-new-covid-19-booster-and-the-flu-shot-now-is-the-right-time-for-both-190826\">getting vaccinated</a> and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy.  </p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html\">now’s the time</a> to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267058/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Libby Richards has received funding from the American Nurses Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute . </span></em></p>",

I have written a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83078-6\">textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders</a>, and, more recently, a self-help book for <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooBA1XtZ9Uea0tv2baj9t8v7TXnaPW7WBf21RqvKUM-imc32kzO\">people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019\">food addiction is a real phenomenon</a>. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70338\">certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed</a> – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes25053\">affect the brains and behavior</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83116-0\">of certain people</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112574\">similarly to other addictive substances</a> such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">nicotine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction.</p>\n\n<h2>How does addiction work?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597351/\">neurobiological mechanisms of addiction</a> have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.010\">preexisting genetic</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000870\">environmental factors</a> set the stage for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00034-y\">developing an addiction</a>. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">important brain systems</a>, leading the person to crave more and more of it.</p>\n\n<p>This rewiring takes place in <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOopjx6BZgKuKhvAdGDFBjZPHVbZiJSDRThQXyEsSsw4nYc1i8iV7\">three key brain networks</a> that correspond to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">key functional domains</a>, often referred to as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.011\">reward system</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.038\">the stress response system</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2013-0054\">the system in charge of executive control</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine\">called dopamine</a> in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0191-4\">neurobiological process called conditioning</a>, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00264\">increasing influence over decision-making and behavior</a>, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. </p>\n\n<p>Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience <a href=\"https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments\">symptoms of withdrawal</a>, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. </p>\n\n<p>At that point, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_288\">negative reinforcement kicks in</a>. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief.</p>\n\n<p>Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex\">prefrontal cortex</a>, and other key parts of the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010654108\">involved in impulse control and self-regulation</a>. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZ5LH634W8s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What evidence is there that food is addictive?</h2>\n\n<p>Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22639\">high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods</a> – often foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762\">that are ultraprocessed</a> – act on these brain networks in ways that are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/foods-high-in-added-fats-and-refined-carbs-are-like-cigarettes-addictive-and-unhealthy-165441\">similar to other addictive substances</a>. The resulting changes in the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008\">fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance</a> – in this case, highly rewarding food.</p>\n\n<p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">hallmark signs of a substance use disorder</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.071\">predicts weight gain</a>. In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13507\">diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal</a>, similar to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019\">when people quit opioids</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.013\">nicotine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.038000.114\">reduce cognitive function and cause damage</a> to the prefrontal cortex and <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus\">hippocampus</a>, the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory.</p>\n\n<p>In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-019-0484-z\">resist their craving for it</a> by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals.

But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, eating disorders such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615\">bulimia nervosa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627\">binge-eating disorder</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00411-0\">often occur alongside addictive eating</a>. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">excessive dietary restriction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A way forward</h2>\n\n<p>But others argue that, with care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16132019\">integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment</a> is feasible and could be lifesaving for some.</p>\n\n<p>The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-024-01017-9\">consider food addiction in their treatment models</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One such approach might look like <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooIfW4_BgKGysr2y90Cts7qyqjoKdpF5HIxXAiNMPY7rRHDYKI3\">the one described to me</a> by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Additional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1556988\">clinical studies</a> are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2024.107211\">already being carried out</a>. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1542905\">are underway</a> by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1159/000527322\">into future editions of diagnostic manuals</a> such as the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases\">World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261727/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have two books for sale which address food addiction, and I could benefit financially from increased interest in the food addiction topic:\n\nWilcox C.E.

And the reality on the ground suggests that the two countries are still far from sealing any deal to end the Israeli military incursions into Syrian territory that have occurred since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024. Just days after the American official gave his prognosis and as negotiations continued, Israel <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/28/middleeast/israel-syria-normalization-strikes-intl\">struck several Syrian targets</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Citing negotiation sources, several news outlets reported that the delay in securing a deal was primarily related to Israel’s 11th-hour demand of creating a so-called <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-09-28/ty-article/.premium/israel-seeks-humanitarian-corridor-of-influence-in-syria-threatening-regime-stability/00000199-8cf4-dbe0-af9d-9ef5d6a00000\">humanitarian corridor</a> that would link the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israeli-occupied Golan Heights</a> to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-druze-are-a-tightly-knit-community-and-the-violence-in-syria-is-triggering-fears-in-lebanon-261931\">Sweidah, a city in southern Syria</a>. Israel said the purpose is to protect religious minorities in the Golan Heights and Sweidah. </p>\n\n<p>The hitch, after months of U.S.-mediated talks, reflects Syria’s vulnerability in these negotiations. Seeking to move on after year of war, the current Syrian leadership is eager to snuff out remaining internal violence, secure the borders and return to the United Nations-brokered truce with Israel that had been in place for decades. However, concluding a deal with its militarily superior neighbor risks the further fragmentation of Syria and an entrenched violation of its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, as an <a href=\"https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=rebeizm\">expert on the Middle East</a>, I believe the talks and the potential last-minute snag point to Israel believing it has the upper hand. Meanwhile for Syria, a desire for security can’t mask what it sees as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria-israelpalestine/how-israels-overreach-syria-may-backfire\">Israel’s expansionist policy in the region</a>, and concerns that it is using things like a proposed humanitarian corridor as a way to achieve recognition of areas only recently under Israeli control.</p>\n\n<h2>The fraught history of Syrian-Israeli relations</h2>\n\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/history/\">United Nations’ partition of Palestine in 1947</a> and the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/war-for-palestine/israel-and-the-arab-coalition-in-1948/DEAE4004B3CD32F1C5EFE7A85B56003D\">a coalition of five Arab armies</a>, including Syria, declared war on Israel and lost the ensuing conflict. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Soldiers stand by barbed-wire fences.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Israeli soldiers stand guard as Syrian Druze people cross back into Syria at the Israeli-Syrian border in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IsraelSyriaClashes/29bdf7af42eb47b5ba4e678dfaccd83f/photo\">AP Photo/Leo Correa</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As a result, Syria was forced to sign an <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/il20sy490720israeli-syrian20general20armistice20agreement.pdf\">armistice agreement</a> with Israel on July 20, 1949. </p>\n\n<p>Yet de facto peace never lasted long. The two countries squared off in repeated conflicts in the next 25 years, including the Six-Day War in 1967 that launched <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israel’s still-ongoing occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1974, the U.N. brokered the <a href=\"https://undof.unmissions.org/background\">Agreement on Disengagement</a> between Israeli and Syrian forces. While not a peace agreement, the pact served to codify a ceasefire and created a buffer zone between the two countries monitored by U.N. observers.</p>\n\n<p>For 50 years, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/16/world/israel-syria-talks-overview-syria-israel-begin-peace-talks-after-4-year-halt.html\">that status quo held uneasily</a>, as <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/madrid-conference\">subsequent peace efforts failed</a>. The conflict was effectively frozen, punctuated by occasional flare-ups of violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Entering the post-Assad era</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/\">fall of Assad and his goverment</a> in December 2024 suddenly injected a new dose of uncertainty into Israel-Syria relations.</p>\n\n<p>As rebel-turned interim President <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> worked to consolidate power and vowed to restore peace and stability for his war-torn country, Israel went on the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the collapse of the Assad government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement “<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-slams-violation-of-1974-disengagement-deal-as-israel-acts-in-syria-buffer-zone/\">void until order is restored in Syria</a>.” As a result, and in violation of the agreement, Israel occupied the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights and expanded its control inside Syria. For months, Israel has conducted a campaign <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/4/mapping-israels-expanding-air-attacks-across-syria\">of airstrikes across Syria</a>, repeatedly bombing Syrian military positions, including near the presidential palace in Damascus. Israel says it is doing so to stop weapon transfers from Iran and to protect its borders and ensure its security. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/\">it has pressed the U.S. to keep Syria weak and divided</a>, in part due to Netanyahu’s and his far-right coalition’s hostility to an Islamist-governed neighbor. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S., at the urging of allies like Saudi Arabia which are close with the Sharaa government, recently lifted sanctions on Syria. For months, officials of the Trump administration have likewise mediated talks and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/under-us-pressure-syria-israel-inch-toward-security-deal-2025-09-16/\">pushed Israel and Syria to conclude an agreement</a> to stop Israel’s seizures and air campaign. </p>\n\n<p>For his part, Sharaa and his negotiators have continually pressed for a halt to Israeli incursions and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/at-un-syrias-sharaa-slams-israeli-attacks-commits-to-1974-disengagement-seeks-dialogue/\">a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement</a> and the de facto borders it established, describing it as a “necessity.” </p>\n\n<h2>Hints of common ground on Hezbollah and Iran</h2>\n\n<p>Aside from Syria’s immediate desire and chief priority to end all hostilities on its territory, there are some potential benefits to a new arrangement with Israel from both countries’ perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Before its fall, the Assad government was close to Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/does-hezbollah-represent-lebanon-and-what-impact-will-the-death-of-longtime-leader-hassan-nasrallah-have-240062\">Hezbollah</a>, a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group funded by Iran, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/assads-fall-in-syria-will-further-weaken-hezbollah-and-curtails-tehrans-iranization-of-region-245606\">supported Assad and played a major role in Syria’s civil war</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, under Assad’s government, Syria served as a land bridge between Iran and Lebanon through which Hezbollah fighters transported their <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/03/double-dealers-lebanon-and-the-risks-of-captagon-trafficking?lang=en\">military equipment, money and drugs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Under Sharaa, Syria’s central government is now closely allied to the Arab Gulf countries that have long been Iran’s regional rivals. In strengthening its security, Syria will no longer serve as Hezbollah-Iran meeting point, which will subsequently benefit Israel. For Syria, it will also stabilize the country against Iranian interference. </p>\n\n<h2>The risk of Syria’s further fragmentation</h2>\n\n<p>The risks of a deal with Israel from Syria’s standpoint, however, are significant.</p>\n\n<p>In defending its incursions into Syria, Israel has pointed to both the security threat it says Syria poses to Israel and also the situation of minority groups in Syria, where sectarian violence has risen against communities like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79q8p8qx1do\">Christian Orthodox</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/08/syria-un-experts-alarmed-attacks-druze-communities-including-sexual-violence\">Druze</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel has floated a number of plans for how it intends to retain a heavy footprint in Syria beyond the occupation of the Golan Heights and the 1974 Agreement of Disengagement. </p>\n\n<p>One option on the table is an extension of the historical buffer zone and splitting Syria into autonomous zones, <a href=\"https://www.dohainstitute.org/en/PoliticalStudies/Pages/proposed-syria-israel-security-agreement-provisions-and-prospects.aspx\">in which Sweidah province</a> would be a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria. With the most recent idea of a humanitarian corridor couched in the language of protecting Syrian minorities, Israel could be seeking a wider area under more explicit control. </p>\n\n<p>From the Syrian perspective, all of the above are backdoor ways by Israel to cement post-Assad military actions beyond the scope of the 1974 truce. As such, agreement to a security pact on Israeli terms would mean jeopardizing or shrinking Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Demonstrators hold up flags.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Syrian protesters gather in front of Damascus Citadel to denounce Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip and to oppose any potential agreement that would lead to normalization of relations with Israel.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/protesters-gather-in-front-of-damascus-citadel-to-denounce-news-photo/2236488646?adppopup=true\">Hasan Belal/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The Syrian leadership’s challenge going forward</h2>\n\n<p>After years of war and fragmentation, most Syrians will take any cessation of hostilities with Israel as a welcome development – but not at any cost. Many Syrians are <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/analysis/federalism-or-fragmentation-future-syrias-minorities\">opposed to further fragmentation of the country</a>. And considering the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">killing and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza</a> – described recently <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">by a U.N. body as genocide</a> – and Syria’s historic commitment to pan-Arabism, many Syrians will likely be skeptical if a security deal with Israel means a de facto recognition of the land and sovereignty Israel has acquired since December 2024. </p>\n\n<p>That points to the major dilemma underpinning Sharaa’s position. Syria is in a vulnerable place and is not in position to negotiate from strength, especially as Sharaa tries to open Syria to the Western world, boost its economy and bring back the civil war refugees from neighboring countries. Seeking to consolidate his government’s hold on power and end the presence of a foreign military, Sharaa likely sees a security agreement as in his immediate interest.</p>\n\n<p>While such a pact may bring some stability to Syria and the region, it could also codify Israel’s nearly unchallenged regional power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265785/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mireille Rebeiz is affiliated with the American Red Cross. </span></em></p>",

Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images </a></span></figcaption></figure><p>On a recent early fall morning, hope was in short supply. </p>\n\n<p>My first patient was a regular. Mr. D was a man in his 50s with diabetes. He had been living on Denver’s streets for most of the past five years, two of them with a walker in tow. Without stable housing and reliable access to insulin, he’d come to the hospital that morning with another limb-threatening infection. </p>\n\n<p>I examined the telltale ulceration on the sole of his foot. It had progressed to the underlying bone and would require another amputation. This time he would be dependent on a wheelchair. I asked him about his prospects for housing. He shook his head and said, “Doc, I just keep falling through the cracks.”  </p>\n\n<p>Mr. D is one of the <a href=\"https://www.mdhi.org/pit\">10,774 people who experienced homelessness</a> on a single night in 2025 across metro Denver, according to a count conducted by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative and partner organizations. Of these, 35% were <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coc-esg-virtual-binders/coc-esg-homeless-eligibility/definition-of-chronic-homelessness/\">experiencing a chronic</a> form of homelessness. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man kneels with a cell phone in his hand next to a person who is sitting and holding a cane.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Each year, homeless service organizations count how many people are experiencing homelessness on one night in January.

People in hospitals and other institutional settings the day of the survey are not reflected in these numbers. Others are hard to spot, staying out of sight on couches or in creek beds, or hiding in plain sight while they serve our food or fix our roads. For these reasons, point-in-time counts <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/many-more-denver-teens-have-experienced-homelessness-than-official-counts-show-249997\">underestimate the true prevalence of homelessness</a> in the city.   </p>\n\n<p>I work at <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/about-denver-health\">Denver Health</a>, the region’s comprehensive safety net health system, where I’m on the front lines of Denver’s homelessness crisis. My perspectives on this issue have been shaped by nearly two decades of experience caring for some of the city’s most vulnerable patients.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve helped create and oversee hospital partnerships that help people like Mr. D find housing. But <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">recent federal actions</a> will only worsen homelessness and weaken the response to it in Colorado and across the nation.   </p>\n\n<h2>Falling through the cracks</h2>\n\n<p>When people like Mr. D fall through the cracks, my colleagues and I are there to catch them. In 2024, Denver Health served <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/-/media/files/about/annual-reports/Report%20to%20the%20City%202024%20Digital%20Final\">more than 16,000 patients experiencing homelessness</a> who collectively had 78,000 visits to the integrated health system. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve watched these cracks widen as Colorado has become one of the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap#summary-table\">least affordable places in the country to live</a>. According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 2025 a Coloradan can work more than 80 hours per week and <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/oor\">still be unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment</a>. This means that housing is woefully out of reach for many of my patients.  </p>\n\n<p>As physicians, we are trained to address the root causes of the diseases we treat. I care for elderly patients who are newly homeless following an eviction, as well as homeless veterans and Lyft drivers who sleep in their vehicles. Though their individual circumstances vary — loss of job or a loved one, an illness or a battle with addiction — the root cause of their homelessness is the same: a lack of affordable and available housing. </p>\n\n<p>Because of an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.0820\">increased prevalence of serious health conditions and structural barriers</a> – such as marginalization and discrimination – that prevent equitable access to primary and preventive health care, people experiencing homelessness often rely on hospitals like ours for care. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, roughly 1 in 6 adults admitted to Denver Health’s hospital for an illness or injury were experiencing homelessness, according to internal data. Like Mr. D, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.52163\">many are aging</a> and have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnw011\">cognitive and mobility impairments</a>, along with the frailty characteristic of much older patients.</p>\n\n<p>Those <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/unsheltered-homelessness/\">living unsheltered</a> suffer preventable harms such as frostbite and heatstroke in Colorado’s climate of extremes. And for many, homelessness is lethal. Last year at least <a href=\"https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/Medical-Examiner/Medical-Examiner-Data#section-6\">223 people</a> died while living on Denver’s streets. </p>\n\n<p>At Denver Health, homeless adults who are admitted to the hospital stay on average 2.4 days longer than housed patients, translating into 5,400 excess hospital days for Denver residents alone, according to internal data. And without a safe place to recover, they have significantly higher readmission rates.  </p>\n\n<p>Evidence of the negative impacts of homelessness on health and hospital resources is so compelling that <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/\">the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a> has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09136-4\">recognized homelessness as a comorbid condition</a>. This designation gives homelessness a similar weight to chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing the needless suffering brought about by patients’ lack of housing and feeling powerless to stop it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-025-09690-5\">contributes to moral injury</a> among health care providers. Moral injury refers to the psychological and emotional wounds that occur when one witnesses events that violate their moral and ethical beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve certainly recognized these feelings in myself or in colleagues who’ve been at the bedside with me all these years. To me, treating the symptoms of homelessness without addressing the underlying cause feels like treating a gunshot wound with a Band-Aid.</p>\n\n<h2>Cure for homelessness</h2>\n\n<p>But unlike many of the conditions I treat, homelessness does have a cure. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put, it’s deeply affordable and supportive housing. Evidence shows that <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487\">Housing First</a> – an approach that prioritizes housing as a critical foundation for engagement in health care services – results in high rates of housing stability and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.01041\">brings down high-cost health care utilization</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman sits in front of a hotel window next to a bike.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Roberta Ramirez stays at the Aspen, a noncongregate homelessness shelter in Denver.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/roberta-ramirez-stays-at-the-aspens-non-congregate-news-photo/2144486536?adppopup=true\">Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet many of the patients I treat, as one of my colleagues likes to say, “will never darken the door of a homeless service agency.” </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, only <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08909-1\">53% of patients on our health system’s homeless registry</a> were using homeless services in the community. In a cruel irony, the chaos of homelessness that forces people to prioritize survival, combined with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2022.2058580\">health conditions such as physical disabilities, dementia or serious mental illness</a>, often collude to prevent patients from engaging with the very systems that could end their homelessness. Sometimes, like Mr. D, they give up trying.</p>\n\n<p>This creates the heartbreaking situations I see in my daily work. Too often the patients with the greatest health care needs and vulnerability are the most underserved. </p>\n\n<p>Over time, I’ve learned that improving health inside the hospital walls increasingly means working beyond them to build collaborations to address the myriad ways our systems are failing patients like Mr. D.  </p>\n\n<h2>Housing and health partnerships</h2>\n\n<p>In Denver some progress has been made. In 2023 <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/newly-minted-denver-mayor-mike-johnston-issues-emergency-declaration-over-homelessness\">Mayor Mike Johnston issued an emergency declaration on homelessness</a>. He subsequently enacted <a href=\"https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Mayors-Office/Programs-and-Initiatives/Homelessness-Initiative\">All in Mile High</a>, a citywide strategy to address street homelessness. Through the collaborative efforts of the city and partnering agencies, on Aug. 27,2025, Denver <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/denvergov/draft-press-release-text-9190431?e=5f378308bf\">announced a 45% reduction in unsheltered homelessness</a> between January 2023 and January 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Denver Health has aided these efforts by investing in strategic partnerships that provide <a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/david-heitz-561257/4186398568417-denver-health-discharges-fewer-homeless-people-to-the-street\">alternatives to discharging hospitalized patients back to the streets</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An apartment building in Denver.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690236/original/file-20250910-56-94rpp9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Renaissance Legacy Lofts and John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center in Denver offer medical respite and permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/renaissance-legacy-lofts-and-stout-street-recuperative-care-news-photo/1243779694?adppopup=true\">Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Since 2023, Denver Health has discharged roughly 700 patients into <a href=\"https://nhchc.org/clinical-practice/medical-respite-care/\">medical respite</a> beds through a partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.coloradocoalition.org/\">Colorado Coalition for the Homeless</a>. The hospital helps fund a portion of beds at the <a href=\"https://www.coloradocoalition.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/TwoPager_JPStoutStreetRecuperativeCareCenter%20%281%29.pdf\">John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center</a> to provide patients who are too ill or frail to recover in shelters or on the streets with <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2023/07/26/colorado-homeless-medical-care\">a safe place and the right support to heal</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>In another effort to offer housing to at-risk patients, the hospital system <a href=\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/office-building-converted-into-affordable-housing/73-7ae28e6a-d274-48a5-b4ac-be01ff43be47\">sold its former administration building to the Denver Housing Authority</a>, which then redeveloped the property. The hospital now leases 14 apartments that it makes available to provide temporary housing and case management to elderly or disabled patients experiencing homelessness following a hospitalization. Most of the 39 patients who have been housed there have attained more permanent housing, according to internal data.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOUxA8qiCcQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A 9News report on the office building converted into affordable housing in Denver.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Denver Health also partners on <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/denver-housing-health-project-housing-stability-payment-outcomes-second-report\">Denver’s Housing to Health Program</a>, a permanent supportive housing program launched in 2022 that aims to reduce health care expenditures for people experiencing chronic homelessness. A hospital team identifies eligible patients and provides “warm handoffs” to directly connect them with the program’s housing service providers during hospitalizations or emergency room visits. While the evaluation is ongoing, it’s a <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/harnessing-health-care-systems-enhance-supportive-housing\">promising partnership model</a> for how hospitals might collaborate to address homelessness.</p>\n\n<h2>Impact of federal policies and funding cuts</h2>\n\n<p>With accompanying investments in proven solutions to homelessness, such partnerships have the potential to deliver better care at lower cost. </p>\n\n<p>Actions taken by the federal government in 2025 that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">criminalize people experiencing homelessness, defund Housing First initiatives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/summary/00\">dismantle Medicaid and other essential benefits</a> threaten these partnerships and our progress. These policies will worsen homelessness, and patients will continue to be “housed” in the least appropriate and most expensive way – in the hospital. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to harming patients, this trend is not sustainable for safety net hospitals like Denver Health that already <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/29/denver-health-medicaid-sales-tax/\">provide millions of dollars annually in uncompensated care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a physician working at the intersection of housing and health, I believe hospitals are key partners in the fight to end homelessness. I’ve observed the hopelessness that homelessness can bring. But I’ve also seen how the right partnerships can transform a routine hospitalization into an unexpected opportunity for meaningful connection that puts patients on the path to housing and health. </p>\n\n<p>Now when I see patients like Mr. D, I see possibility rather than another dead end for them. After all, for all their adversity, my patients’ stories are also stories of beauty, strength and resilience. While the “cracks” keep me up at night, their stories, and the partnerships we’ve created, bring me hope at a time when hope seems in short supply. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Patient initials and other identifying details have been changed to protect confidentiality.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/local\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261234/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sarah A.

Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/csb-releases-final-report-on-2019-massive-tank-farm-fire-at-the-intercontinental-terminals-company-facility-in-deer-park-texas/\">more than 70 million gallons of petroleum</a> products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/intercontinental-terminals-company-pay-over-66-million-injuries-natural-resources-resulting\">determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines</a>. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1386420.015\">no reason to investigate further</a> or impose fines or other penalties on the company.</p>\n\n<p>A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/mission/\">seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents</a>. It’s an approach much like the <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process/Pages/default.aspx\">National Transportation Safety Board</a> takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/\">prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That deep investigative process <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">reportedly will not happen</a> in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery</a> in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/ehs/phdstudents/steenstra-philip.html\">scholars</a> of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZieRajIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">chemical</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3QFImkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">disasters</a>, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget</a> – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A fire at several large round buildings sends dark black smoke into the sky.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A fire burns at Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Petrochemical-Fire-Texas/0164e16ea5d34ed4afb24146e1e3931d/photo\">AP Photo/David J.

They included necessary updates to safety management systems, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/itc_report_-_final_(july_6,_2023).pdf\">the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks</a>, and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/?F_InvestigationId=3602\">reportedly working on the next two</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_ripe_study_finalv.pdf\">storage tanks be spaced farther apart</a> so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review.</p>\n\n<p>And the Texas fire was just <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/investigations/completed-investigations/?F_FromDate=1/1/2019&amp;F_ToDate=12/31/2019\">one of several disasters</a> the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">investigations of 102 chemical disasters</a> in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_strategic_plan11.pdf\">France, South Korea and China</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ReYsPKwVy64?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board video summarizes the agency’s findings about a March 2019 petrochemical terminal fire in Texas.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Creation and goals of the CSB</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/history/\">created by Congress in a 1990 amendment</a> to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Those included the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.051\">1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy</a>, which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in <a href=\"https://origins.osu.edu/read/bhopal-chemical-gas-disaster\">Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate</a> from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident\">Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster</a> in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">prevent similar accidents from occurring</a> on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically designed to be <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/chemical-safety-and-hazard-investigation-board\">independent of other organizations and political influence</a>, the CSB <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">cannot be forced to modify its findings</a> by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality. </p>\n\n<p>It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">recommendations are adopted by the industries affected</a>, usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"LWgds\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LWgds/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What does the board do?</h2>\n\n<p>There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-VI/part-1604\">releases of particular chemicals</a>, such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride.</p>\n\n<p>The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded.</p>\n\n<p>After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry.</p>\n\n<h2>The board’s value</h2>\n\n<p>The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\">more than $6 trillion</a> the U.S. government spends each year.</p>\n\n<p>The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA</a>. But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the CSB has <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/public-comments/\">helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations</a>, such as for the <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_epa_rcra_comment_letter_5-14-2024_(004).pdf\">open burning of waste explosives</a>, and improved methods of <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_comments_epa-hq-oem-2015-0725_51020161.pdf\">investigating accidental chemical releases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_osha_emergency_response_comment_letter_7-12-2024.pdf\">implementing new emergency response rules</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265546/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. </p>\n\n<p>Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/american-enlightenment-thought/\">underrated American pastime</a>, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” </p>\n\n<p>I could go on. Because he did. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A yellowed copy of a short publication with the title 'Common Sense.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Published in 1776, Thomas Paine’s pamphlet ‘Common Sense’ inveighed against monarchy and hereditary privilege and in favor of independence for the Colonies.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.si.edu/collections/snapshot/eloquent-argument\">Smithsonian National Museum of American History</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Birth of a revolutionary</h2>\n\n<p>Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine\">small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737</a>. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, <a href=\"https://www.laits.utexas.edu/gov310/CF/Paine_Sense/index.html\">met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London</a>, sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical.  </p>\n\n<p>Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">renounced, repudiated and ridiculed</a> at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/PaineRightsOfMan/mode/2up\">Hereditary privilege, colonialism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.ageofreason00pain_0/?st=gallery\">the supernatural</a>: no, no, no. </p>\n\n<p>But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">were kings</a>. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1776ThomasPaine.pdf\">Common Sense,” his first major work</a>, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694951/original/file-20251007-56-zkg03b.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lawn signs that quote 'No King!

It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” </p>\n\n<p>Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. </p>\n\n<p>“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.</p>\n\n<h2>Bring the Paine</h2>\n\n<p>The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.</p>\n\n<p>This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A somewhat puckish-looking middle-aged man from the 18th century, holding a\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A somewhat puckish-looking Thomas Paine – with the wrong first name and a different spelling of his last one.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://npg.si.edu/exhibit/paine/pop-ups/01-01.html\">National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.</p>\n\n<p>“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/\">Federal worker firings</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006\">court settlements</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025\">a government shutdown</a>. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.</p>\n\n<p>Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. </p>\n\n<p>The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.   </p>\n\n<p>Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Matthew Redmond does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, the framework explicitly states that Hamas must be excised from any future discussions of postwar Gaza. Moreover, no other Palestinian group has any direct involvement; Hamas’ main rival Fatah – the party that is in control of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank – is only briefly mentioned. As for that Palestinian Authority, there is only a vague line about reforming the body.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been no mention of what the Palestinian people might actually want. In this way, the body being proposed recalls the creation of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority during the invasion of Iraq. That body governed Iraq immediately following the invasion and was <a href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/11/02/failures_of_the_coalition_provisional_authority_in_iraq_112574.html\">criticized for corruption and lack of transparency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The failure of the Iraq War, and the U.K.’s involvement in it, contributed to Blair’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/10/tonyblair.labour\">resignation as prime minister</a> in 2007, after which he took on the role of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/the-quartet/\">special envoy to the Quartet</a>. Led by the U.N., U.S., EU and Russia, the Quartet was tasked with preserving some form of the two-state solution and implementing economic development plans in Palestinian cities. </p>\n\n<p>But it, too, failed to address the changing political realities on the ground as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/israeli-settlements/\">Israeli settlements expanded</a> and the military occupation deepened.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying assumption about the Quartet, critics contend, is that it largely ignored the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty; rather, it focused on marginally improving economic conditions and Band-Aid initiatives. </p>\n\n<p>The latest U.S.-backed proposal cribs heavily from the approach. Even if it does bring about a welcome respite from the suffering in Gaza in the short term, I believe a durable, mutually agreed upon resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires what Trump’s plan sidelines: Palestinian self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>In Northern Ireland, Blair once understood the importance of neutral mediation and the buy-in of all parties to the conflict and the people themselves. The plan he is involved with now appears to be operating with a far different calculus.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266742/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dana El Kurd is affiliated with the Arab Center Washington. </span></em></p>",

These are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZaHhxJEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I’m a MOF scientist</a> and for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me.</p>\n\n<h2>So, what exactly are MOFs?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern.

In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests.</p>\n\n<h2>Why scientists love them</h2>\n\n<p>What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space.

Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m91P-R3kxOs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So far, scientists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17755-8\">synthesized over 90,000 MOFs</a>, and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. </p>\n\n<p>Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01650\">isoreticular MOFs</a>. These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture.</p>\n\n<h2>Pushing the boundaries of these materials</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses.</p>\n\n<p>Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr2003272\">capturing carbon dioxide</a> from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">clean polluted water</a> by removing heavy metals, dyes or “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-pfas-the-forever-chemicals-showing-up-in-drinking-water-an-environmental-health-scientist-explains-185015\">forever chemicals</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.200601878\">for medical applications</a>. In the energy world, they function <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214715\">as electrodes or electrolytes</a> that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr9003924\">serve as catalysts</a>, accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. </p>\n\n<p>When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja903726m\">named MIL-125</a>. It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Demos_Techniques_and_Experiments/General_Lab_Techniques/Proper_Use_of_a_Desiccator\">no desiccator</a> – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench.</p>\n\n<p>That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">withstand water, heat and repeated use</a>. Since their foundation, researchers around the world have <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/materials/metal-organic-frameworks/conductive-MOFs-electrocatalyst-sensors/99/i43\">introduced new properties to these materials</a> – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. </p>\n\n<p>Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">clean water straight from desert air</a>, to building more <a href=\"https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/cooling-homes-without-warming-the-planet/\">energy-efficient air conditioners</a>. What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world.</p>\n\n<h2>A Nobel moment that honors creativity</h2>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/press-release/\">honoring three remarkable scientists</a> – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies.</p>\n\n<p>When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in <a href=\"https://kampouri.blogs.rice.edu/\">my own research group</a>, we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this Nobel Prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: Chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267089/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stavroula (Alina) Kampouri receives research funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF) and other public research agencies.</span></em></p>",

Using quantum systems to perform computation promises to allow researchers <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-advantage-a-quantum-computing-scientist-explains-an-approaching-milestone-marking-the-arrival-of-extremely-powerful-computers-213306\">to solve problems</a> in areas from chemistry to cryptography that have so many possible solutions that they are beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful nonquantum computers possible. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum computing depends on researchers developing practical quantum technologies. Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/\">Nobel Prize in physics</a> was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a physicist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=q1_eBhsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies superconducting circuits</a> for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted.</p>\n\n<h2>Big, cold, quantum</h2>\n\n<p>In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/profile/john-martinis/\">John Martinis</a>, then-postdoctoral researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2CeGqLAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Michel Devoret</a> and UC Berkeley professor <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R7uhrOoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works\">John Clarke</a> showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-do-superconductors-work-a-physicist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-resistance-free-electricity-202308\">superconductors</a>. A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. </p>\n\n<p>Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. </p>\n\n<p>Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"four parallel brass-colored rings connected by vertical tubes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/AFMC-News/Article/2470321/afrl-measures-first-superconducting-quantum-bits-qubit-first-ever-demo-for-a-do/\">U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.014021\">near-ideal microwave amplifier</a> based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8654\">emulate a group of electron-like particles</a>. This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. </p>\n\n<p>In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58947-4\">demonstrate a protocol</a> for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. </p>\n\n<p>But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing.</p>\n\n<h2>Superconducting quantum computers</h2>\n\n<p>Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-entanglement-a-physicist-explains-the-science-of-einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-191927\">entangled</a>, so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. </p>\n\n<p>In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them.</p>\n\n<p>Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else.</p>\n\n<p>The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, academic research groups <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/lfl/\">like mine</a> develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118297/ibm-large-scale-error-corrected-quantum-computer-by-2028/\">create large-scale quantum processors</a> for practical use. </p>\n\n<h2>Superconductor pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has <a href=\"https://qolab.ai/\">his own company</a>, while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. </p>\n\n<p>I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. </p>\n\n<p>Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266979/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Levenson-Falk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They allege that the president has it out for Comey, who investigated <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-defends-russia-investigation-essential-testimony-senate-panel/story?id=73338331\">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election and was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527663050/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired by Trump</a> in 2017. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s own words support the idea that the Trump administration is targeting Comey. <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\">In a social media post</a> on Sept. 20, 2025, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with prosecutions against Comey, Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James: “They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. …JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p>\n\n<p>If the case against Comey is exceedingly weak – and little more than a political prosecution – then, in my view <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kdr4x8oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">as a scholar of the U.S. legal system</a>, it should result in the dismissal of charges by the judge or a not guilty verdict by the jury.</p>\n\n<p>But even when an individual is not convicted, the process of defending against charges can itself <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=oPAWAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">be a form of punishment</a>, as renowned legal scholar <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/malcolm-feeley/#tab_profile\">Malcolm Feeley</a> pointed out almost 50 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how the criminal justice process punishes even innocent people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The criminal justice process</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/steps-federal-criminal-process\">criminal justice process is complex</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indictment\">grand jury returns an indictment</a> at the request of a prosecutor, the accused <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/arraignment\">appears in court for their arraignment</a>. They are informed of the charges against them and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/plea\">typically enter a plea</a>. </p>\n\n<p>During what’s called “<a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/procedure/discovery-in-criminal-cases/\">discovery</a>,” the prosecution and defense investigate the evidence the other side plans to rely on. There are also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pretrial-motions\">pretrial motions</a> in which the parties ask judges to dismiss charges and accept or exclude evidence. </p>\n\n<p>The defense and prosecution may also meet to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pleabargaining\">discuss a plea bargain</a>, wherein the accused may plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence or reduced charges. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no plea bargain, then the case moves to trial, which is itself a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/trial\">complicated process</a>. If a defendant is found guilty, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/appeal\">they can mount an appeal</a> to higher courts in an attempt to have their conviction overturned.</p>\n\n<p>To help navigate this process, criminal defendants typically hire a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>And good lawyers don’t come cheap.</p>\n\n<h2>Money and time</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indigent\">Indigent defendants</a>, who do not have the financial resources to pay their own legal fees, <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/defender-services\">can rely on public defenders</a> paid for by the government. </p>\n\n<p>But individuals who can afford to pay for their own lawyer face a substantial financial burden for attorney services <a href=\"https://www.criminallegalnews.org/media/publications/brennan_center_for_justice_reentry_report_2010.pdf\">and court fees</a>. An experienced criminal defense lawyer can charge <a href=\"https://ludwiglawfirm.com/understanding-the-real-cost-of-hiring-a-federal-criminal-defense-lawyer\">more than US$1,000</a> <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/big-law-firm-sues-hunter-biden-for-unpaid-legal-bills-tied-to-gun-trial-other-cases/\">per hour</a>, with fees quickly adding up. This means that mounting a legal defense can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, it takes a great deal of time to prepare for a criminal case. While lawyers and their staff do much of the legwork for trial preparation, a client works with their attorneys to help formulate a defense.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, criminal defendants lose one of the most <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethharris/2017/08/30/study-shows-time-is-the-most-valuable-commodity-so-heres-a-smart-way-to-value-time/\">precious commodities in the world</a>: their time.</p>\n\n<p>And this time can come at a tangible cost in the form of lost wages, which harms their day-to-day lives. Put simply, every hour spent preparing for trial is an hour defendants could spend working or enjoying their lives.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three women holding each other as they stand outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Patrice Failor, center, wife of former FBI Director James Comey, is embraced by daughters Claire Comey, left, and Maurene Comey at the courthouse in Alexandria, Va., where James Comey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Oct. 8, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/patrice-failor-wife-of-former-fbi-director-james-comey-is-news-photo/2239936179?adppopup=true\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Stress and embarrassment</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not pleasant being charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p>The criminal process, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344888776_Delivering_Timely_Justice_in_Criminal_Cases_A_National_Picture\">which typically lasts months</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mdlawgroup.ca/articles/how-to-manage-stress-during-a-criminal-trial\">takes a toll</a> on one’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2021.100050\">mental</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13218719.2020.1751327\">health</a>. This is largely driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a criminal trial and the possibility of losing one’s freedom if convicted.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2014.1004035\">social stigma</a> that comes with being accused of a crime. This can result in reputational damage, anxiety and embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration appears to recognize this reality. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-agent-relieved-duty-over-refusing-comey-perp-walk-four-people-familiar-say-2025-10-03/\">Several media</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">outlets</a> have reported that FBI leadership had planned a public <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perp%20walk\">perp walk</a> for Comey. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">According to a CBS News report</a>, this was to have included “‘large, beefy’ agents … ‘in full kit,’ including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo.” Apparently, the plan was aborted after several FBI supervisors refused to cooperate, viewing it as inappropriate. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/04/politics/fbi-agent-fired-comey\">One agent was disciplined for insubordination</a> after refusing to go along with the plan to embarrass Comey in this way. </p>\n\n<h2>Not all criminal defendants suffer the same</h2>\n\n<p>The extent to which criminal defendants experience the criminal justice process as a form of punishment varies from person to person.</p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.finance-monthly.com/james-comeys-net-worth-in-2025-a-deep-dive-into-the-life-and-career-of-the-former-fbi-director/\">high-status people like Comey</a>, lost wages and attorneys’ and court fees may not be that big of a deal. </p>\n\n<p>But these costs may be incredibly significant for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/list-individuals-including-lisa-cook-targeted-trump-administration/story?id=124968309\">other people</a> who have been, or are likely to be, targeted by the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>The high costs of lawyers’ fees are well known to the president. For instance, his political action committee spent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508\">millions of dollars</a> on attorneys’ fees in an unsuccessful effort to defend Trump from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0\">criminal charges</a> in New York.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, people no doubt experience the psychological stress and stigma of a possible criminal conviction differently. But regardless of one’s wealth, the lost time spent preparing a criminal defense is something that cannot be replaced.</p>\n\n<p>The recognition that the criminal process is itself a form of punishment is one of the reasons that the <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/legal-ethics-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/03/GT-GJLE230038.pdf\">Department of Justice has maintained independence</a> from the president. By <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html\">violating the tradition</a> of staying out of politics, the Justice Department in the Trump administration has opened the door for the president to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies.</p>\n\n<p>The mere act of putting them through the criminal process ensures that they suffer, regardless of their guilt or innocence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266747/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Paul M.
