      "content": "<p>In today’s hot housing market, winning a bidding war can feel like a triumph. But my research shows <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5399525\">it often comes with a catch</a>: Homebuyers who win bidding wars tend to experience a “winner’s curse,” systematically overpaying for their new homes.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.steve-sh-choi.com\">a real estate economist</a>, and my colleagues and I analyzed nearly 14 million home sales in 30 U.S. states over roughly two decades. We found that people who paid more than the asking price for their homes – a reliable sign of a bidding war – were more likely to default on their mortgages and saw significantly weaker returns.</p>\n\n<p>How much weaker? On average, homebuyers who won bidding wars saw annual returns that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than those who didn’t, we found. We specifically looked at “unlevered” returns – basically, the returns you’d get if you bought the home outright with cash, without factoring in a mortgage. </p>\n\n<p>Since the typical homeowner in our sample held a property for 6.3 years before selling it, this translates to about an 8.2% overpayment. Bidding-war winners were also 1.9 percentage points likelier to default.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps that loss would be worth it to someone who absolutely loves the property – but we found that homebuyers who purchase after a bidding war are also faster to resell. This suggests their overpayment is based less on enduring affection and more on bidding-war fever.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that the effects of the winner’s curse – lower home appreciation and higher default rates – are stronger in places where bidding wars are more common. One example is my hometown of Rochester, New York, which has become a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-to-rochester-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-2021-7\">bidding-war hot spot</a> in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Who bears the brunt? Lower-income, Black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to overpay in bidding wars, we found, making them more likely to suffer from the winner’s curse. This suggests that hot housing markets can worsen inequality.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>While housing is the largest single form of wealth Americans own, past research on the winner’s curse mostly dealt with land auctions and company mergers – not the nation’s roughly <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B25032?t=Units+and+Stories+in+Structure\">76 million owner-occupied, single-family homes</a>. Our work is the first to show the direct evidence of the winner’s curse in residential housing markets. </p>\n\n<p>This matters now because the housing market is cooling. Those who bought in the post-pandemic housing market and listed their homes in 2025 are already facing <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/selling-at-a-loss-2025/\">the risk of selling at a loss</a>. Because this risk falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic homebuyers, it could further widen the wealth gap. </p>\n\n<p>By one measure, foreclosures are up <a href=\"https://www.homes.com/news/foreclosure-rates-rise-nationwide/325546485/\">18% year over year</a>. If the brunt of these losses falls on lower-income or otherwise vulnerable homeowners, the result could be an increase in housing insecurity and homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that the winner’s curse may be preventable. Better resources to <a href=\"https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/originating-underwriting/mortgage-products/homeownership-education\">prepare first-time homebuyers</a> and comprehensive financial education related to mortgages and debt could help.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>It’s possible more transparent bidding processes – or even formal auction systems for popular homes – could better inform prospective buyers and help them stave off the temptation of overpayment. Should the U.S. require real estate brokers or banks to caution their clients to think twice before going above the asking price? Or would that be unfair to sellers? Experimental research on these points would be useful.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, our research focuses on the U.S. housing market. Whether the winner’s curse afflicts buyers in other countries remains an open question.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266723/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Soon Hyeok Choi does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Instead of landing a job and moving to the big city after graduation, many are moving back into their childhood homes instead. About <a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Fdemo%2Ftables%2Ffamilies%2Ftime-series%2Fadults%2Fad1.xls&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK\">1.5 million more adults under 35</a> live with their parents today than a decade ago. That’s a 6.3% jump, more than double the rate of growth for the young adult population overall.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is affordability. Over the past decade, urban rents have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEHA\">climbed about 4% per year</a>, while wages for full-time workers have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881900Q\">increased by only 0.6% annually</a>. That means it’s harder than ever to live in a big city on the typical salary – especially if you’re a new graduate without much work experience.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is even more challenging for aspiring homeowners: The median house price in the U.S. has risen about <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI\">90% in just 10 years</a>, or more than 6% each year. And as prices rise – the median home sells for <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\">more than $400,000</a> now – so too do the ages of homebuyers. The median first-time U.S. homebuyer is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/many-first-time-homebuyers-are-pushing-40-millennials-wait-vain-better-rcna201786\">38 years old</a>, up from <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/interactive-maps-median-age-of-home-buyers-2003-2013\">31 about a decade ago</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is the rent so high?</h2>\n\n<p>Put simply, there isn’t enough housing. <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/rpshah1.php\">As an economist</a>, I know that when demand rises faster than supply, prices have to increase. And supply is severely limited in the places where people most want to live: big cities such as <a href=\"https://edc.nyc/housing-crisis-and-new-york-city\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/regional-housing-need-san-francisco-bay-area/\">San Francisco</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In most of these cities, planning and zoning laws prevent developers from building enough to meet demand. For example, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3792544\">rezoning a plot of land</a> from commercial to residential often requires mountains of paperwork. And in many cities, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/business/single-family-zoning-laws\">objections from neighbors</a> can stall a proposed development. These are just two of many obstacles local governments throw in homebuilders’ way. </p>\n\n<p>One city that has tried something different is Austin, Texas. After <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/22/austin-texas-rents-falling/\">deliberately relaxing its zoning laws</a> a few years ago, Austin has seen <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2025/03/25/austins-property-boom-brings-bolder-new-build-luxury-to-a-balanced-market/\">a boom in home construction</a>. Rents fell by 10% in one year and by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-27/austin-rents-tumble-22-from-peak-on-massive-home-building-spree?srnd=homepage-americas\">as much as 22%</a> in two years after that change. By making it easier to build, Austin has made it cheaper to live there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Austin has a far lower share of its young adults living with their parents than many other cities do. <a href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/living-at-home-study/\">Just 6% of working adults</a> in the Austin metro area live with their parents, one analysis found, versus nearly 14% in Greater San Antonio and 20% in Greater Los Angeles. </p>\n\n<h2>The pros and cons of living with the ’rents</h2>\n\n<p>One obvious advantage of living with parents is that they tend to charge below-market rents, or nothing at all. That makes it easier to save for a deposit on a house, helping young adults get on the property ladder sooner than they would otherwise. Indeed, homeownership rates among those 25 to 34 have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CXU980230LB0403M#:%7E:text=Table_content:%20header:%20%7C%202023:%20%7C%2033%20%7C,%7C%202023::%202019:%20%7C%2033:%2033%20%\">risen slightly since 2016</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also potential disadvantages, however, particularly when it comes to socializing. Living at home with parents can make it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/dating-while-living-with-parents/620699/\">much more challenging</a> to <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-challenges-of-dating-while-living-at-home-with-your-parents\">meet new people</a>. This, in turn, could partly help explain why <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/families-and-households/ms-2.pdf\">Americans are getting married</a> and <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/geriatric-pregnancy-increases-complication-rate\">having children later in life</a>. These delays might not seem important, but they can leave people feeling like they’re behind in life, which can affect their health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>I also wonder whether living with parents is indirectly making young adults unhappier at work. That’s because older adults often live <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2473\">far from the urban centers</a> where <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/\">young people are most likely to find jobs</a> directly related to their degrees. Job satisfaction rates are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/25/young-workers-express-lower-levels-of-job-satisfaction-than-older-ones-but-most-are-content-with-their-job/\">substantially lower among 18- to 29-year-olds</a> than among the rest of the working population.</p>\n\n<h2>A problem for the entire US</h2>\n\n<p>The housing shortage isn’t just an issue for young adults. A recent analysis I found insightful was headlined “<a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/\">The housing theory of everything</a>.” It argued that the issue helps explain at least part of the current malaise in the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when people can’t live and work where they want, they’re unable to use their talents fully. That contributes to the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006092\">relatively slow productivity growth</a> the U.S. has experienced in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if people can’t live in areas where they might meet and work with like-minded individuals, they have fewer opportunities to share ideas, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-59517-1.00006-4\">which can hinder innovation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And if the housing shortage is indeed encouraging young adults to delay having children, it could make it harder for the U.S. to fund Social Security and other government programs in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Making it easier to build new homes in places people want to live and work could go a long way to easing these problems. It’s possible high rents translate into high barriers to adulthood, too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264570/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I am acquaintances with the authors of the article &quot;The Housing Theory of Everything.&quot;</span></em></p>",

Democratic leaders countered that <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403\">the subsidies are not a new demand</a> but rather the continuation of a program that has <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">helped keep record numbers of Americans insured since the pandemic</a> – and therefore that the issue could not be delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a standoff that blends fiscal and policy disagreements – a hallmark of contemporary budget politics.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://law.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/wendy-netter-epstein.aspx\">experts</a> in <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/christopher-robertson/\">health law</a>, we see this issue as simple but consequential from a legal standpoint. Congress authorized the enhanced subsidies in 2021, originally to cushion the economic fallout from COVID-19 for families, and extended them through 2025 in the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Without new legislation, the subsidies revert to pre-2021 levels on Jan. 1, 2026 – which would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/insurers-preliminary-rate-filings-anticipate-biggest-increases-in-aca-marketplace-plan-premiums-since-2018/\">jump in the cost of health insurance</a> and would make <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced subsidies explained</h2>\n\n<p>Most Americans under age 65 get insurance through their employers, which the federal government <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-exclusion-employer-sponsored-health-insurance-work\">subsidizes by making it tax-free</a>. Medicare, the program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the program that mainly serves low-income Americans, are heavily supported by subsidies too. </p>\n\n<p>But as of 2025, about <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/over-24-million-consumers-selected-affordable-health-coverage-aca-marketplace-2025\">1 in 6 people</a> under age 65 do not have access to this coverage, including many small-business owners and tradespeople, as well as part-time workers and those in the gig economy. For them, unsubsidized health insurance can be prohibitively expensive. </p>\n\n<p>To address this affordability problem, the ACA provided for households earning between 100% and 400% of the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">federal poverty level</a> to receive subsidies for purchasing policies on the ACA marketplace, effectively lowering premiums. The original law limited subsidies only to those making under 400% of the federal poverty level, which is, for a family of four in 2025, around US$128,000 per year. A family making $129,000 a year, however, would have to pay full price. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Family in the kitchen, mom cooks dinner as daughter watches.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">If the current ACA subsidies expire, almost 5 million people are likely to lose their health insurance coverage.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mother-and-daughter-cooking-together-at-home-royalty-free-image/1390904687\">FG Trade/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan\">American Rescue Plan</a> temporarily made two major changes in 2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It removed the 400%-of-poverty eligibility ceiling, extending help to many middle-income families. </p></li>\n<li><p>It capped the maximum household contribution at 8.5% of income for everyone, ensuring affordability regardless of income. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these reforms expire in 2026, the Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48290\">must revert to the older, less generous formula</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What the subsidies accomplished</h2>\n\n<p>The enhanced subsidies drove <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2025-open-enrollment-period-report-national-snapshot-2\">ACA marketplace participation to historic highs</a> – more than 24 million people selected plans for 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020.

The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket premiums for an individual would jump from about $888 in 2025 to $1,900 in 2026. </p>\n\n<p>With these increases, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/changes-health-care-spending-and-uncompensated-care-under-enhanced-tax-credit\">Urban Institute</a>,  a think tank, projects that 7.3 million fewer people would receive subsidized marketplace coverage and 4.8 million more would become uninsured.</p>\n\n<p>This is highly consequential, as research shows that insurance coverage <a href=\"https://nihcm.org/publications/does-having-health-insurance-coverage-reduce-mortality\">saves lives by ensuring access to care</a>. Knocking nearly 5 million people off insurance may cause as many as <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf\">500 additional deaths per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Losses would disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. Free premium plans would disappear. Those making below 250% of the federal poverty level could see their net premiums rise more than fourfold, while those between 250% and 400% would see their premiums double. What’s more, rural Americans, already under pressure from the state of the economy, <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">face higher risks</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CyyCi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CyyCi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The fiscal and policy trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p>On the flip side, making the enhanced credits permanent would <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61734\">add about US$350 billion to federal deficits between 2026 and 2035</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates. Proponents argue that the <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/the-price-of-obamacare-subsidies-loss-millions-uninsured-thousands-at-greater-risk/\">cost is justified by reduced medical debt</a>, fewer uninsured, greater household stability and ultimately saving lives. Short-term savings from cutting the subsidies would also lead to higher health care costs, longer-term. But critics worry it’s a <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/cbo-jct-asked-about-impacts-of-making-health-insurance-premium-tax-credit-permanent/\">broad and expensive way to support affordability</a>, benefiting some higher-income households that could otherwise afford coverage, even though it would cost more than 8.5% of their income. </p>\n\n<p>Another concern is how the subsidies affect price competition. Under the ACA, the government pays most of the difference between what a household is expected to contribute and the actual cost of a standard benchmark plan. That means if health insurance companies raise their premiums, those who receive subsidies don’t feel the effect of the premium increases, because the federal subsidy simply grows to cover it. That means companies have fewer reasons to compete on price.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and administrative constraints</h2>\n\n<p>Because the subsidies are written into the tax code, only Congress can extend them or make them permanent. The question of whether to renew them was already debated strenuously when Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">big tax and spending package</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. By omitting the subsidies, the bill effectively raised health care costs for millions of middle-income Americans. States that run their own marketplaces may add some aid, but few can match the scale of federal support. </p>\n\n<p>Administrative timing matters too. The IRS, health insurers and the online marketplace all need to know how the subsidy amounts will be calculated – in other words, which income limits and premium caps Congress wants to use. These figures determine how much financial help people get when they sign up for coverage. Late or temporary fixes can create confusion for both consumers and administrators.</p>\n\n<h2>Options before Congress</h2>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have several options, each with different trade-offs. </p>\n\n<p>A permanent extension would provide stability for consumers and insurers – but at the cost of higher long-term federal spending. A short-term renewal of one to four years could soften the immediate jump in premiums while giving Congress time to reassess the policy, but it would continue the cycle of temporary fixes.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2025/07/30/aca-subsidy-extension-changes\">targeted approach</a> might preserve the larger subsidies for lower-income households but gradually reduce assistance for higher earners so that they aren’t guaranteed a cap of 8.5% of their income for insurance. This would make the policy more fiscally restrained but less universal.</p>\n\n<p>Some legislators have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/offsetting-aca-enhanced-subsidy-extensions\">offsetting the cost of ACA subsidies</a> by pairing an extension with savings elsewhere in the health system. Those savings could come from trimming what the government pays insurers to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or by reducing Medicare payments to doctors.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these options reflects a different balance among affordability, fiscal responsibility and administrative simplicity. Together, they highlight how difficult it is to design a policy that meets all three goals at once.</p>\n\n<h2>A structural challenge</h2>\n\n<p>The problem isn’t just political – it’s built into how time-limited programs like the enhanced ACA subsidies are designed. The subsidies <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/conservatives-backed-the-ideas-behind-obamacare-so-how-did-they-come-to-hate-it-149698\">have always reflected partisan divides</a>, but their temporary nature makes those divides even sharper. Lawmakers limited them to a few years to keep costs down, but that choice now means Congress has to reopen the same debate every year.</p>\n\n<p>When deadlines for renewing programs collide with larger funding fights, important benefits can lapse, not because lawmakers chose to end them but because the fights over broader spending leave little room for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it’s up to Congress to decide not only whether these subsidies continue, but whether big social policies like this should be settled through last-minute budget showdowns. For now, getting the government running and keeping health insurance affordable are part of the same fight.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266851/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Wendy Netter Epstein is a member of the Illinois Health Benefits Exchange Advisory Committee. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher Robertson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

If it is resolved quickly, the costs will be small, but if it drags on, it could send the U.S. economy into a tailspin. </p>\n\n<p>That’s because the economy is already in a precarious state, with the labor market struggling, consumers losing confidence and uncertainty mounting.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/expert/john-w-diamond\">economist who studies public finance</a>, I closely follow how government policies affect the economy. Let me explain how a prolonged shutdown could affect the economy – and why it could be a tipping point to recession.</p>\n\n<h2>Direct impacts from a government shutdown</h2>\n\n<p>The partial government shutdown <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/02/us/trump-government-shutdown\">began on Oct. 1, 2025</a>, as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a deal on funding some portion of the federal government. A partial shutdown means that some funding bills have been approved, entitlement spending continues since it does not rely on annual appropriations, and some workers are deemed necessary and stay on the job unpaid.</p>\n\n<p>While most of the 20 shutdowns that occurred from 1976 through 2024 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\">lasted only a few days</a> to a week, there are signs the current one <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-quick-compromise-to-the-first-government-shutdown-in-nearly-7-years-seems-unlikely-266450\">may not be resolved so quickly</a>. The economy would definitely take a direct hit to gross domestic product from a lengthy shutdown, but it’s the indirect impacts that could be more harmful. </p>\n\n<p>The most recent shutdown, which extended over the 2018-2019 winter holidays and lasted 35 days, was the longest in U.S. history. After it ended, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54937\">estimated the partial shutdown delayed</a> approximately US$18 billion in federal discretionary spending, which translated into an $11 billion reduction in real GDP. </p>\n\n<p>Most of that lost output was made up later once the shutdown ended, the CBO noted. It estimated that the permanent losses were about $3 billion – a drop in the bucket for the <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/gdp-update\">$30 trillion U.S. economy</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a man in a uniform locks a gate on a road into a park\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many parks, such as Florida’s Everglades National Park, were closed as a result of the shutdown.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/APTOPIXGovernmentShutdown/ad3339c153c142eeb844c34ec97be763/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The indirect and more lasting impacts</h2>\n\n<p>The full impact may depend to a large extent on the psychology of the average consumer. </p>\n\n<p>Recent data suggests that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/us-consumer-confidence-falls-to-five-month-low-on-job-market\">consumer confidence is falling</a> as the stagnation in the labor market becomes more clear. Business confidence has been mixed as the <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence\">manufacturing index</a> continues to indicate the sector is in contraction, while <a href=\"https://www.economy.com/united-states/business-confidence/seasonally-adjusted\">other business confidence measures</a> indicate mixed expectations about the future.</p>\n\n<p>If the shutdown drags on, the psychological effects may lead to a larger loss of confidence among consumers and businesses. Given that consumer spending accounts for 70% of economic activity, a fall in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/understanding-consumer-confidence-index/#:%7E:text=7-,CCI%20Interpretation,action%20to%20stimulate%20the%20economy.\">consumer confidence</a> could signal a turning point in the economy.</p>\n\n<p>These indirect effects are in addition to the direct impact of lost income for federal workers and those that operate on federal contracts, which leads to reductions in consumption and production.  </p>\n\n<p>The risk of significant government layoffs, beyond the usual furloughs, could deepen the economic damage. Extensive layoffs would shift the losses from a temporary delay to a more permanent loss of income and human capital, reducing aggregate demand and potentially increasing unemployment spillovers into the private sector. </p>\n\n<p>In short, while shutdowns that end quickly tend to inflict modest, mostly recoverable losses, a protracted shutdown – especially one involving layoffs of a significant number of government workers – could inflict larger, lasting impacts on the economy.</p>\n\n<h2>US economy is already in distress</h2>\n\n<p>This is all occurring as the U.S. labor market is flashing warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Payrolls <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">grew by only 22,000</a> in August, with July and June estimates revised down by 21,000. This follows payroll growth of only 73,000 in July, with May and June estimates revised down by 258,000. \nIn addition, preliminary annual revisions to the employment data show the economy gained <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prebmk.nr0.htm\">911,000 fewer jobs</a> in the previous year than had been reported. </p>\n\n<p>Long-term unemployment is also rising, with 1.8 million people out of work for more than 27 weeks – nearly a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2025/number-of-long-term-unemployed-was-1-8-million-in-july-2025.htm\">total number of unemployed individuals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, AI adoption and cost-cutting could further reduce labor demand, while an aging workforce and lower immigration shrink labor supply. Fed Chair Jerome Powell refers to this as a “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250822a.htm\">curious kind of balance</a>” in the labor market.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the job market appears to have come to a screeching halt, making it difficult for recent graduates to find work. Recent graduate unemployment – that is, those who are 22 to 27 years old – is now <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693\">5.3% </a> relative to the total unemployment rate of 4.3%.</p>\n\n<p>The latest data from the <a href=\"https://mediacenter.adp.com/2025-10-01-ADP-National-Employment-Report-Private-Sector-Employment-Shed-32,000-Jobs-in-September-Annual-Pay-was-Up-4-5\">ADP employment report</a>, which measures only private company data, shows that the economy lost 32,000 jobs in September. That’s the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">biggest decline</a> in 2½ years. While that’s worrying, economists like me usually wait for the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers to come out to confirm the accuracy of the payroll processing firm’s report.</p>\n\n<p>The government data that was supposed to come out on Oct. 3 might have offered a possible counterpoint to the bad ADP news, but due to the shutdown BLS will not be releasing the report.</p>\n\n<h2>Problems Fed rate cuts can’t fix</h2>\n\n<p>This will only increase the uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. And it adds to the uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariffs as well as the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-sets-10-tariff-lumber-imports-higher-rates-wooden-products-2025-09-30/\">newly imposed tariffs</a> on lumber, furniture and other goods. </p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">Fed is expected to lower</a> interest rates at least two more times this year to stimulate consumer and business spending following its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fed-rate-cut-is-attempt-to-prevent-recession-without-sending-prices-soaring-265370\">September quarter-point cut</a>. This raises the risk of reigniting inflation, but the cooling labor market is a more immediate concern for the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>While lower short-term rates may help at the margin, I believe they cannot resolve the deeper challenges, such as massive government <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-treasury-statement/summary-of-receipts-outlays-and-the-deficit-surplus-of-the-u-s-government\">deficits</a> and <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/\">debt</a>, tight <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ongoing-inflation-concerns-reshaping-spending-135500814.html\">household budgets</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cbreim.com/insights/articles/digging-out-of-the-us-housing-affordability-crisis\">housing affordability crisis</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shrinking-labor-force-scariest-number-job-market-hiring-unemployment-2025-8\">shrinking labor force</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The question now is not will the Fed cut rates, because it likely will, but whether that cut will help, particularly if the shutdown lasts weeks or more. Monetary policy alone cannot overcome the uncertainty created by tariffs, the lack of fiscal restraint, companies focused on cutting costs by replacing people with technology, the impact of the shutdown and the fears of consumers about the future.</p>\n\n<p>Lower interest rates may buy time, but they won’t solve these structural problems facing the U.S. economy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266327/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John W.

      "content": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">Shohei Ohtani</a> stepped onto the field at the Tokyo Dome in March 2025, he wasn’t just playing a game – he was carrying forward more than <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/featured/japan-baseball-history\">100 years of baseball ties</a> between the U.S. and Japan. </p>\n\n<p>That history was front and center when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs opened their 2025 regular season <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/international/events/tokyo-series\">facing off in the Tokyo Series</a> on March 18 and 19. The two games featured <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/seiya-suzuki-673548\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shota-imanaga-684007\">players</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/yoshinobu-yamamoto-808967\">from</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/player/roki-sasaki-808963\">Japan</a>, capping a slate of events that included four exhibition games against Japanese professional teams. </p>\n\n<p>It was a massive financial success. Marking MLB’s first return to Tokyo since 2019, the series generated over <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/03/18/manfred-expects-tokyo-series-to-set-event-records\">US$35 million in ticket sales and sponsorship revenue</a> and <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/tokyo-series-merchandise-sets-sales-040000367.html\">$40 million in merchandise sales</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNIpKhTE24M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The first game of the Tokyo Series broke viewership records in Japan.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For MLB, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-viewership-increases-usa-japan-streaming-2025\">significant viewership growth this season</a>, it was proof that its investment in Japan and <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-global-reach-world-baseball-classic\">international baseball</a> over the past three decades has been paying off. </p>\n\n<h2>Baseball’s early journey to Japan</h2>\n\n<p>Baseball, which is by far the most popular sport in Japan, was introduced to the nation <a href=\"https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g02195/\">during the Meiji Restoration</a> in the late 19th century. </p>\n\n<p>American baseball promoters were quick to see the potential of the Japanese market, touring the country <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-1908-reach-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">as early as 1908</a>. The most famous such tour took place in 1934 and featured <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/murder-espionage-and-baseball-the-1934-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">a number of American League All-Stars</a>, including Babe Ruth and catcher Moe Berg, who was later revealed to be <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/moe-bergs-life-in-baseball\">a U.S. spy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That trip had a long legacy. The U.S. All-Stars faced a team called <a href=\"https://japanball.com/baseball/npb-teams/tokyo-yomiuri-giants/?srsltid=AfmBOoqWKZEd6wiVM0TJkiAA6rFkQocx3feJ2uD3sUE_1i9IqfCDG40I\">The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club</a>, which, a year later, barnstormed in the United States. When they played the San Francisco Seals, the Seals’ manager, Lefty O’Doul – who later trained baseball players in Japan – suggested a name change to better promote the team for an American audience. </p>\n\n<p>Commenting that Tokyo is the New York of Japan, O’Doul suggested they take on one of their team names. And since “Yankee” is a uniquely American term, The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club was reborn as the Tokyo (Yomiuri) Giants. </p>\n\n<p>When the Giants returned to Japan, the Japanese Baseball League was formed, which was <a href=\"https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/baseball-in-japan-and-the-us-history-culture-and-future-prospects\">reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball in 1950</a>. The Giants have gone on to dominate the NPB, winning 22 Japan Series and producing <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-who-are-the-yomiuri-giants-all-to-know-about-them-ahead-of-the-tokyo-series-two-thousand-twenty-five/\">Sadaharu Oh</a>, who hit 868 home runs during his illustrious career.</p>\n\n<h2>Breaking into MLB</h2>\n\n<p>The first Japanese-born MLB player, <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/inside-pitch/murakamis-big-league-debut-changed-the-game\">Masanori Murakami</a>, debuted for the San Francisco Giants in September 1964. But his arrival wound up sparking a contractual tug-of-war between the NPB and MLB. To prevent future disputes, the two leagues signed <a href=\"https://sportslitigationalert.com/the-evolution-of-the-united-states-japanese-player-contract-agreement\">an agreement in 1967</a> that essentially blocked MLB teams from signing Japanese players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the 1990s, this agreement became untenable, as some Japanese players in NPB became frustrated by their lack of negotiating power. After the <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kintetsu_Buffaloes\">Kintetsu Buffaloes</a> refused to give Hideo Nomo a multiyear contract after the 1994 season, his agent found a loophole in the “<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/hideo-nomo-pioneered-path-to-mlb-in-1995\">voluntary retirement clause</a>” that would allow him to sign with an MLB franchise. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995. </p>\n\n<p>Nomo’s impact was immeasurable. His “tornado” windup and early success made him one of the most popular players in the major leagues, which was recovering from the cancellation of the World Series the previous year. In Japan, “<a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/hideo-nomo/\">Nomo fever</a>” took hold, with large crowds gathering television screens in public to watch him play, even though his games aired in the morning. <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-029_cf69d0f7-b1e5-41ec-8e79-ef3253c78aae.pdf\">Nomo helped drive Japanese sponsorship and television rights</a> as his first season ended with him winning National League Rookie of the Year.</p>\n\n<p>But within a few years, disputes over contracts soon showed the need for new rules. This ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-baseball-strengthened-relationship-between-united-states-japan-180968597/\">establishment of posting rules for NPB</a> players looking to transition to the major leagues. </p>\n\n<p>The rules have shifted some since they were set out in late 1998, but if a player declares their intention to leave NPB, then <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/japanese-posting-system\">MLB teams have a 45-day window to negotiate</a>. If the player from NPB is under 25 or has less than nine years of professional experience, they’re subject to the limited MLB signing pool for international players. Otherwise, they’re declared a free agent.</p>\n\n<h2>A wave of stars</h2>\n\n<p>The new rules led many more Japanese players to join major league baseball from Nippon Professional Baseball: Of the 81 Japanese players who’ve played in the majors, all but four played in NPB before their debut. Ichiro Suzuki, who became the first Japanese player <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/mariners/fans/ichiro-hall-of-fame\">inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, was also the first Japanese position player to make the leap.</p>\n\n<p>Other players, like Hideki Matsui, the only Japanese player to be named World Series MVP, continued the success. And <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/baseballs-two-way-players-from-babe-ruth-to-shohei-ohtani-and-2024-potential-draftees-like-jac-caglianone/\">then came Ohtani</a>, a two-way superstar who both hits and pitches, drawing comparisons to Babe Ruth. </p>\n\n<p>For MLB, Japanese players haven’t just boosted performance on the field – they’ve expanded its global fan base. The Dodgers brought in over <a href=\"https://www.foxla.com/sports/shohei-ohtani-made-120-million-dodgers\">$120 million in increased revenue in Ohtani’s first year alone</a>, easily covering his salary even with Ohtani signing the richest contract in baseball history. The franchise has also seen its value increase by at least <a href=\"https://www.sportspro.com/news/mlb-team-valuations-2025-yankees-dodgers-march-2025/\">23% to nearly $8 billion</a>. MLB has also seen a <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/mlb-unveils-2026-schedule-as-big-changes-loom-soon-after/\">significant increase in viewership</a> over the past two seasons, partially driven by the growing interest from Japan.</p>\n\n<p>As American sports leagues deal with an increasingly distracted, fragmented domestic audience, it’s not surprising that they’re looking abroad for growth. And as MLB teams prepare to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46139027/2025-mlb-free-agency-offseason-early-intel-contracts-schwarber-tucker-imai-bregman-alonso\">court another wave of Japanese stars this offseason</a>, it’s clear that its decades-long investment in Japan is paying off.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264668/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jared Bahir Browsh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The federal government has tracked and analyzed this data for the past three decades, but it plans to stop after publishing statistics pertaining to 2024 data. The Conversation U.S. asked Tracy Roof, a political scientist who has <a href=\"https://polisci.richmond.edu/faculty/troof/\">researched the history of government nutrition programs</a>, to explain the significance of the U.S. Household Food Security Survey and what might happen if the government  discontinues it.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What’s food insecurity?</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us\">defines food security</a> as “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” </p>\n\n<p>People who are food insecure are unsure they can get enough food or unable to get enough food to meet these basic needs because they can’t afford it.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"AqPvV\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AqPvV/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>How does the government measure it?</h2>\n\n<p>The USDA has collected data on food insecurity since the mid-1990s. It includes the share of the population that is food insecure and a subset of this group considered to have very low food security.</p>\n\n<p>People who are food insecure may not significantly reduce how much they eat, but they are likely to eat less balanced meals or lower-quality food. People with <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement\">very low food security</a> report eating less altogether, such as by skipping meals or eating smaller meals.  </p>\n\n<p>These statistics are based on answers to questions the USDA adds to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html\">Current Population Survey</a>, which the Census Bureau administers every December. There are <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement\">10 questions</a> in the survey. Households with children are asked four more.</p>\n\n<p>The questions inquire about access to food, such as whether someone has worried in the past year that their food would run out before they had enough money to buy more, or how frequently they have skipped meals, could not afford balanced meals, or felt hunger.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. food insecurity rate <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics#foodsecure\">stood at 13.5% in 2023</a>, the most recent year for which data is currently available. The final annual food security report, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ending-america-hunger-report-snap-cuts-750f90757f50ab2d8bc97dfca5a917dd\">expected in October</a>, will be issued for 2024 – based on data collected during the Biden administration’s last year.</p>\n\n<h2>Why did the government start measuring it?</h2>\n\n<p>Calls for creating the <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/blog/commemorating-history-snap-looking-back-food-stamp-act-1964\">food stamp program in the 1960s</a> led to an intense debate in Washington about the extent of malnutrition in the U.S. Until then, the government did not consistently collect reliable or national statistics on the prevalence of malnutrition.</p>\n\n<p>Those concerns reached critical mass when the Citizens’ Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition, launched by a group of anti-hunger activists, issued a report in 1968, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/22.4.480\">Hunger USA</a>. It estimated that 10 million Americans were malnourished.</p>\n\n<p>That report highlighted widespread incidence of anemia and protein deficiency in children. That same year, a CBS documentary, “<a href=\"https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/cbs-reports-hunger-in-america/\">Hunger in America</a>,” shocked Americans with disturbing images of malnourished children. The attention to hunger resulted in a significant expansion of the food stamp program, but it did not lead to better government data collection.</p>\n\n<p>The expansion of government food assistance all but eliminated the problem of malnutrition. In 1977, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/us/field-foundation-civil-rights-pioneer-to-die-at-49-survivors-will-be-legion.html\">Field Foundation sent teams of doctors</a> into poverty stricken areas to assess the nutritional status of residents. Although there were still many people facing economic hardship, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1256803497\">the doctors found</a> there was little evidence of the nutritional deficiencies they had seen a decade earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Policymakers struggled to reach a consensus on the definition of hunger.  But the debate gradually shifted from how to measure malnutrition to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/604180\">how to estimate how many Americans lacked sufficient access to food</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Calls for what would later be known as food insecurity data grew after the Reagan administration scaled back the food stamps program in the early 1980s. Despite <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82\">the unemployment rate soaring to nearly 11%</a> in 1982 and a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2024/demo/p60-283/figure1.pdf\">steep increase</a> in the poverty rate, the number of people on food stamps <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/167036/7foodstamps.pdf\">had remained relatively flat</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Reagan administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/15/us/if-one-american-is-going-hungry-reagan-says-it-s-one-too-many.html?searchResultPosition=15\">denied that there was a serious hunger problem</a>, news reports were filled with stories of families struggling to afford food.</p>\n\n<p>Many were families of unemployed breadwinners who had never needed the government’s help before. During this period, the <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/604180\">number of food banks</a> grew substantially, and they reported soaring demand for free food.</p>\n\n<p>Because there was still <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/604180\">no government data</a> available to resolve the dispute, the Reagan administration responded to political pressure by creating a task force on hunger in 1983. It <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/01/10/President-Reagans-hunger-task-force-concluding-there-is-hunger/4683442558800/\">called for improved measures</a> of the nutritional status of Americans. </p>\n\n<p>The task force also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/129.2.510S\">pointed to the difference</a> between “hunger as medically defined” and “hunger as commonly defined.” That is, someone can experience hunger – not getting enough to eat – without displaying the physical signs of malnutrition. In other words, it would make more sense to measure access to food as opposed to the effects of malnutrition.</p>\n\n<p>In 1990 Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr1608\">National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act</a>, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law. It required the secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to develop a 10-year plan to assess the dietary and nutritional status of Americans. This <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/history-background\">plan, in turn, recommended</a> developing a standardized measurement of food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>The Food Security Survey, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/129.2.510S\">developed in consultation with a team of experts</a>, was first administered in 1995. Rather than focusing on nutritional status, it was designed to pick up on behaviors that suggested people were not getting enough to eat.</p>\n\n<h2>Did tracking food insecurity help policymakers?</h2>\n\n<p>Tracking food insecurity allowed the USDA, Congress, researchers and anti-hunger groups to know how <a href=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/09/23/usda-cancels-food-security-report-that-anti-hunger-advocates-say-showed-the-effects-of-food-policies/\">nutritional assistance programs were performing</a> and what types of households continued to experience need. Researchers also used the data to look at the causes and consequences of food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Food banks <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/feeding-america-statement-usda-annual-report\">relied on the data</a> to understand who was most likely to need their help.</p>\n\n<p>The data also allowed policymakers to see the big jump in need during the Great Recession starting in 2008. It also showed a slight decline in food insecurity with the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus\">rise in government assistance early in the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, followed by another big jump with <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings\">steeply rising food prices</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">big budget bill Congress passed</a> in July will <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/big-legislative-package-shifts-more-of-snaps-costs-to-states-saving-federal-dollars-but-causing-fewer-americans-to-get-help-paying-for-food-260166\">cut spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a> by an estimated US$186 million through 2034, an almost 20% reduction.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of SNAP, the <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/history#2008%20fcea\">new name for the food stamp program adopted in 2008</a>, <a href=\"https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/250925_-_letter_to_sec._rollins_regarding_cancellation_of_usda_household_food_security_report.pdf\">worry the loss of the annual reports will hide</a> the full impact of these cuts.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RpGrZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpGrZ/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Why is the administration doing this?</h2>\n\n<p>In the brief <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/09/20/usda-terminates-redundant-food-insecurity-survey\">press release the USDA issued</a> on Sept. 20 announcing the termination of the annual food insecurity reports, the USDA indicated that the Trump administration considers the food security survey to be “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous,” and does “nothing more than fear monger.”</p>\n\n<p>While I disagree with that characterization, it is true that <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/getcontentasset/6f04791d-d297-4bfb-a03d-f1b32b822648/7ca0dc9d-611d-46e2-9fd3-26a4c03ddcbb/food_access_programs_report.pdf?language=en\">anti-hunger advocates have pointed</a> to increases in food insecurity to call for more government help.</p>\n\n<h2>Is comparable data available from other sources?</h2>\n\n<p>Although the USDA noted there are “more timely and accurate data sets” available, it was not clear which datasets it was referring to. <a href=\"https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/250925_-_letter_to_sec._rollins_regarding_cancellation_of_usda_household_food_security_report.pdf\">Democrats have called</a> on the Trump administration to identify the data.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us\">Feeding America</a>, the largest national network of food banks, releases an annual food insecurity report called the <a href=\"https://map.feedingamerica.org/\">Map the Meal Gap</a>. But like other nonprofits and academic researchers that track these trends, it relies on the government’s food insecurity data.</p>\n\n<p>There is other government data on <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foodaps-national-household-food-acquisition-and-purchase-survey\">food purchases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html\">nutritional status</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-security-in-the-united-states/documentation\">host of other surveys</a> that use USDA questions. However, there is no other survey that comprehensively measures the number of Americans who struggle to get enough to eat.</p>\n\n<p>As in the 1980s, policymakers and the public may have to turn to food banks’ reports of increased demand to get a sense of whether the need for help is rising or falling. But those reports can’t replace the USDA’s Food Security Survey.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266006/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tracy Roof does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Since 1998, that has been the case for foreign companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges or acting in the U.S., too.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Trump administration, however, expectations are changing. In February 2025, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/\">an executive order</a> froze new investigations for 180 days, arguing that the act has been “stretched beyond proper bounds” and “harms American economic competitiveness.” The president ordered a review of enforcement guidelines to ensure they advance U.S. interests and competitiveness.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act/fcpa-guidelines\">revised guidelines</a>, issued in June 2025, prioritize cases that are tied to cartels and other transnational criminal organizations, harm U.S. companies or their “fair access to compete,” or involve “infrastructure or assets” important for national security.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever impact the new guidelines will have on <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/117726/transnational-survival-foreign-corrupt-practices/\">anti-corruption prosecutions globally</a>, which is still unclear, the impact on the actual level of corruption will likely be small. Legal rules and sanctions designed to deter, find and punish “bad apples” have had <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/understanding-success-and-failure-of-anti-corruption-initiatives\">limited success in many parts of the world</a>. Yet the United States’ retreat from leadership could set back momentum for addressing the root causes of corruption.</p>\n\n<h2>New anti-corruption norm, but limited change</h2>\n\n<p>In 1977, when the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law, the U.S. was alone in criminalizing bribery of foreign officials. Since then, and especially since the end of the Cold War, there’s been a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66254-1_12\">paradigm shift</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, a global infrastructure of treaties and institutions obligates countries to criminalize corruption, adopt measures to prevent it and cooperate to recover stolen assets. All but a few members of the United Nations have adopted the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/corruption/en/uncac/learn-about-uncac.html\">U.N. Convention Against Corruption</a>. Substantial amounts of international aid have also been allocated to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. In 2021 alone, the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/committees/development-assistance-committee.html\">Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> invested over US$7.5 billion <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/peace-and-official-development-assistance_fccfbffc-en.html\">for reforms related to fighting corruption</a>, from anti-corruption courts to public financial management.</p>\n\n<p>Yet global trends in corruption, widely defined as <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/what-is-corruption\">the “abuse of entrusted power for personal gain</a>,” are not improving. On the <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024\">2024 Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, the most widely used global ranking of public sector corruption, two-thirds of countries scored below 50 on a scale where 0 is “very corrupt” and 100 is “very clean.” And while 32 countries had reduced corruption since 2012, 148 had either stayed the same or gotten worse. </p>\n\n<p>Corruption, it turns out, can be <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/mapping-evidence-gaps-in-anti-corruption-assessing-the-state-of-the-operationally-relevant-evidence-on-donors-actions-and-approaches-to-reducing-corruption\">stubbornly resistant</a> <a href=\"https://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/DFIDs-Approach-to-Anti-Corruption-and-its-Impact-on-the-Poor-FINAL.pdf\">to “best practices</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A beige sign with illustrations of one hand holding money reaching out toward another hand signaling 'stop.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A sign at a Congolese hospital reminds patients that payments directly to staff are not allowed.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/photo-essay-in-a-hospital-in-congo-struggle-against-news-photo/151035588?adppopup=true\">BSIP/Universal Images Group Via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>A few examples illustrate this “whack-a-mole” dynamic. Medical personnel in Ugandan hospitals began to <a href=\"https://dlprog.org/publications/research-papers/islands-of-integrity-reductions-in-bribery-in-uganda-and-south-africa-and-lessons-for-anti-corruption-policy-and-practice/\">solicit “gifts” and “appreciation</a>” after the government imposed greater oversight and penalties for bribery. A study of World Bank efforts in over 100 developing countries to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105000\">clean up procurement corruption</a> found that gains in one area were canceled out when government buyers started to use procedures not subject to the new rules.

One key factor <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/\">we</a> (and <a href=\"https://giace.org/\">many others</a>) found is that most conventional anti-corruption tools are addressing the wrong problem.</p>\n\n<p>The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar measures focus on preventing, detecting and punishing individual acts of corruption. Rules requiring reporting and asset declarations, monitoring and oversight, and criminal penalties for corruption belong to this category. These tools try to limit the power people have over decisions and resources and <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/how-anti-corruption-change-happens\">increase accountability and transparency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This approach works where corrupt acts are sporadic, opportunistic deviations from the norm by “bad apples” acting to enrich themselves. It also assumes that rule of law and robust institutions exist.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of people sit on the ground and along a cement wall, all facing one way, under a blue sky.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Filipinos protest on Sept. 21, 2025, in Manila after corruption was uncovered in flood control projects that have embroiled officials, engineers, contractors and politicians.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/filipinos-take-part-in-a-protest-against-corruption-at-news-photo/2236510953?adppopup=true\">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This is not the case in much of the world – especially in <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/states-of-fragility-2025_81982370-en.html\">fragile and conflict-affected states</a> where corruption is endemic. By “endemic,” I mean not just that corruption is widespread, but that it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10999922.2025.2520679\">embedded in politics and the economy</a> – a “team effort” within broad networks, with informal rules of the game. As an Afghan official reportedly <a href=\"https://www.sigar.mil/Reports/Article-Display/Article/4020349/corruption-in-conflict-lessons-from-the-us-experience-in-afghanistan/\">told U.S. Embassy officials in 2010</a>, endemic corruption “is not just a problem for the system of governance … it is the system of governance.” </p>\n\n<p>What makes the conventional anti-corruption tool kit so ineffective in contexts of endemic corruption?</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1. It does not pay to follow the rules.</strong> Without trusted leaders and institutions to implement the law, it is difficult for people to behave honestly, as they don’t trust that others will do the same. Corruption, in this sense, is a “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x\">collective action” problem</a>. If corruption is the norm, not the exception, the short-term costs of sticking to the rules are too high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2. Corruption serves a useful function – even when it undermines the public good.</strong> Even when people believe it’s wrong, corruption can <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/08/corruption-nigeria\">solve problems</a> that seem unsolvable in their current system. For example, <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/understanding-the-multiple-social-norms-behind-informal-payments-in-the-health-sector-of-nigeria\">health workers in Nigeria often ask for bribes</a> because their salaries are low and clinics lack needed supplies. The money helps them fulfill family obligations and make clinics work. Similarly, politicians often practice patronage because it <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecaffa/v26y2006i4p19-23.html\">helps them redistribute wealth to retain supporters and stabilize conflict</a>. Unless dysfunction is addressed, incentives to bypass the rules remain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3. Informal institutions prevail over formal rules.</strong> When a government cannot be relied upon to provide security, services or livelihoods, people <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/understanding-social-norms%3A-a-reference-guide-for-policy-and-practice\">rely on their personal networks</a> to survive. As a judge in the Central African Republic <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/pity-the-man-who-is-alone%3A-corruption-in-the-criminal-justice-system-in-bangui%2C-central-african-republic\">told our research team</a>, “If someone [within your social network] asks for a service, you are required to do it, even if it goes against your own ethics. To refuse is to put oneself in opposition [to one’s clan] and this can be dangerous.”</p>\n\n<h2>Loss of leadership</h2>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://voxdev.org/topic/institutions-political-economy/foreign-corruption-regulation-helps-african-communities\">does not mean</a> that conventional anti-corruption approaches are completely ineffective or irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren’t enough on their own. They work best hand in hand with interventions that address motivating factors – from low pay to a lack of livelihoods not dependent on corruption, to social norms that motivate people to seek bribes or make them hesitate to enforce the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, momentum has built to develop these <a href=\"https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CIPE-How-To-Guide-to-Anti-Corruption-Messaging-2-1.pdf\">new approaches</a> – though it is still early to assess their effectiveness. Some focus on fixing government dysfunction. Others help unite people and groups <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/collective-action-against-corruption-in-the-criminal-justice-system\">trying to resist corruption</a>. Some projects <a href=\"https://ace.soas.ac.uk/publication/case-study-reducing-corruption-in-climate-infrastructure-in-bangladesh/\">support “horizontal” monitoring</a> by peer firms or communities, instead of government regulation, or <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/leveraging-behavioral-insights-to-mitigate-public-procurement-corruption-in-nigeria/\">try to “nudge” behaviors</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/03/taking-action-against-corruption-nigeria\">change social norms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The limitations of existing anti-corruption approaches suggest that more limited enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is not likely, by itself, to worsen global corruption. But the loss of U.S. leadership may.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. role in anti-corruption progress cannot be understated – as a leader in “<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/publications/exporting-corruption-2022\">policing” foreign corruption</a>, a model for other countries’ laws and institutions, and a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/16/fact-sheet-u-s-achievements-in-the-global-fight-against-corruption/\">leading donor</a>. It is still unclear whether others – such as the U.K., the most <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/new-world-order-us-uk-international-anti-corruption-enforcement-2025-07-23/\">likely and dedicated candidate</a> – can fill the gap. </p>\n\n<p>Equally concerning, in my view, is the danger that the U.S. turn to a more self-serving view of anti-corruption efforts may encourage a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/117726/transnational-survival-foreign-corrupt-practices/\">corrupt use of anti-corruption enforcement</a>. Many authoritarian governments have <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/rethinking-anti-corruption-in-de-democratising-regimes\">weaponized anti-corruption laws</a> to target political opponents through selective prosecutions.</p>\n\n<p>If the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is used this way, this could not only undermine the legitimacy of global anti-corruption norms but <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/how-anti-corruption-efforts-can-inadvertently-fuel-conflict\">exacerbate conflict</a> and <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/rethinking-anti-corruption-in-de-democratising-regimes\">fuel democratic backsliding</a> at home and abroad.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263894/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Diana Chigas receives funding for her research from The MacArthur Foundation, Transparency International Canada and the Wellspring Philanthropic Fund through Besa Global, Inc., a social enterprise in Canada dedicated to improving anti-corruption effectiveness in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Not long after U.S. housing prices reached a record high this summer – the median existing home went for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477513/home-prices-hit-an-all-time-high-while-sales-are-down-how-come\">US$435,000 in June</a> – President Donald Trump said that he was <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/trump-says-hes-considering-eliminating-tax-on-home-sales-00467915\">considering a plan</a> to make home sales tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of the idea, introduced by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/congressional-record-index/119th-congress/1st-session/no-tax-on-home-sales-act/1953625\">No Tax on Home Sales Act</a> in July, say it would benefit working families by eliminating all taxes on the sales of family homes.</p>\n\n<p>But most Americans who sell their homes already do so tax-free. And the households that would gain most under Trump’s proposals are those with the most valuable real estate.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://law.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=beverly-moran\">legal scholar</a> who studies how taxes affect racial and economic inequality, I see this proposal as part of a familiar pattern: measures advertised as relief for ordinary families that mostly benefit the well-off.</p>\n\n<h2>Most families already sell their homes tax-free</h2>\n\n<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-26-internal-revenue-code/26-usc-sect-121/\">according to the Internal Revenue Code</a>, a single person pays no tax on the first $250,000 in gain from a home sale, while married people can exclude $500,000. All told, <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/capital-gains-2025/d.\">about 90% of home sales</a> generate less than $500,000 in gains, so the overwhelming majority of sellers already owe no tax.</p>\n\n<p>The minority who would see new benefits from the proposed tax change are those with more than $500,000 in appreciation – typically owners of <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/capital-gains-2025/#:%7E:text=Single%20family%20homes%20more%20likely,having%20gained%20at%20least%20$500%2C000.&amp;text=In%20comparison%2C%2015%25%20of%20townhouses,in%20value%20since%20last%20sold\">high-priced homes in hot real estate markets</a>. Yale’s Budget Lab estimated the average benefit for these tax-free sales was <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/who-would-benefit-eliminating-capital-gains-taxes-home-sales\">$100,000 per qualifying seller</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Homeownership itself isn’t equally distributed across the U.S. population. About <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\">44% of Black Americans</a> are homeowners, compared with 74% of white Americans. That racial gap has <a href=\"https://eyeonhousing.org/2024/02/homeownership-rates-by-race-and-ethnicity-3/\">only widened over the past 10 years</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/single-women-get-lower-returns-from-housing-investments\">single women</a> – particularly but not exclusively women of color – face additional barriers. </p>\n\n<h2>A broader trend of upward wealth transference</h2>\n\n<p>Though still just a proposal, the tax-free home sales bill is part of a broader set of Republican tax plans that would have <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/regressive-tax\">regressive effects</a> – that is, where the vast majority of benefits go to high-income people and very few to low-income people – under a <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-tax-deductions-for-working-americans-and-seniors\">pro-worker banner</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Trump floated the tax-free home sales idea less than three weeks after he signed a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions\">large package of tax and spending measures</a>  in July 2025. That bill generated <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/kff-health-tracking-poll-views-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/\">strong public criticism</a> because of its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/getattachment/1332c86f-04b9-4b89-a418-1df4804e7427/x-33-25.pdf\">tax savings for the rich</a> at the expense of <a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/07/22/medicaid-chip-and-affordable-care-act-marketplace-cuts-and-other-health-provisions-in-the-budget-reconciliation-law-explained/\">almost a trillion dollars</a> in cuts for federally funded <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2025/trump-big-beautiful-bill-your-taxes-cuts/\">health care for the poor and disabled</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The home sales idea follows the same script – and echoes the distributional pattern established by his <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/what-is-the-tcja\">2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>. That tax reform increased <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-2017-tax-cuts-expire-soon-study-shows-they-made-income-inequality-worse-and-especially-hurt-black-americans-233758\">racial wealth and income disparities</a> and provided <a href=\"https://inequality.org/article/trump-tax-cuts-inequality/\">80% of its benefits</a> to corporations and high-income individuals. In fact, my research shows that white households received <a href=\"https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RI_TCJA-Impact-on-Black-Taxpayers_Brief_062024.pdf\">more than twice as many tax cuts</a> as Black households from that law.</p>\n\n<p>The same dynamic plays out in this new tax-fueled housing policy. Eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales would primarily benefit the <a href=\"https://www.lendfriendmtg.com/learning-center/no-tax-on-home-sales\">29 million homeowners who already have substantial equity</a> – a group that skews heavily white, male and upper middle class. Meanwhile, America’s millions of renters, disproportionately people of color and women, would receive no benefit while potentially losing access to social programs Congress must cut to fund these tax breaks.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264959/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Beverly Moran is a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, and Paulus Endowment senior tax fellow at Boston College.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>For years, I’ve puzzled over a question that seems to defy common sense: If stock markets are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-5-graphics-2025-09-15/\">hitting records</a> and tech innovation seems endless, why aren’t companies pouring money back into new projects? </p>\n\n<p>Yes, they’re still investing – but the pace of business spending is slower than you’d expect, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/08/18/how-americas-ai-boom-is-squeezing-the-rest-of-the-economy\">especially outside of AI</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And if you’ve noticed headlines about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67a6d06d-0ecf-4a8b-98d8-1b1254e49035\">sluggish business spending</a> even as corporate profits soar, you’re not alone. It’s a puzzle that’s confounded economists, policymakers and investors for decades. Back in 1975, U.S. public companies reinvested an average of 25 cents for every dollar on their balance sheets. Today, that figure is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">closer to 12 cents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, corporate America is flush with cash, but it’s surprisingly stingy about reinvesting in its own future. What happened?</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/business/leeds-directory/faculty/david-ikenberry\">an economist</a>, and my colleague <a href=\"https://business.rice.edu/person/gustavo-grullon\">Gustavo Grullon</a> and I recently published a study in the Journal of Finance that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">turns the field’s conventional wisdom on its head</a>. Our research suggests the issue isn’t cautious executives or jittery markets – it’s about how economists have historically measured companies’ incentives to invest in the first place. </p>\n\n<h2>Asking the wrong Q</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, economists have relied on a simple but appealing ratio – <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qratio.asp\">Tobin’s Q</a>, named after the famous economist James Tobin – to gauge whether companies should ramp up investment. </p>\n\n<p>They calculate this by dividing a company’s market value – what it would take to purchase the firm outright with cash – by its replacement value, or how much it would cost to rebuild the company from scratch. The result is called “Q.” The higher the Q, the theory goes, the more incentive executives have to invest.</p>\n\n<p>But reality hasn’t conformed to fit the theory. Over the past half-century, Tobin’s Q has gone up, yet investment rates have gone down sharply. </p>\n\n<p>Why the disconnect? Our research points to one key culprit: excess capacity. Many U.S. companies already have more factories, machines or service capability than they can use. By not correcting for this issue, the traditional Tobin’s Q will overstate the incentive that companies have to grow.</p>\n\n<p>To see this, consider a commercial real estate company that owns a portfolio of office buildings. In recent years, with the rise of e-commerce and remote work, many of their properties have been running well below capacity. Now suppose a few new tenants start paying rent and begin absorbing a portion of that empty space. Stock prices will rise in response to seeing these new cash flows, which in turn will lead Q to rise. </p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, this increase in Q would suggest that it’s a good time to invest in new buildings – but the reality is quite different with idle capacity still in the system. Why pour money into building another office tower if existing ones still have empty floors?</p>\n\n<p>This key idea is that what matters isn’t the average value of all assets – it’s the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073115/what-difference-between-marginal-utility-and-marginal-value.asp\">marginal value</a> of adding one more dollar of investment. And because <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capacityutilizationrate.asp\">capacity utilization</a> has been steadily eroding over the past half-century, many firms see little reason to invest.</p>\n\n<p>That last point may come as a surprise, but the U.S. economy, with all its factories and offices, isn’t nearly as abuzz with activity as it was after, say, World War II. Today, many sectors operate <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TCU\">well below full throttle</a>. This growing slack in the system over time helps explain why companies have pulled back on their rate of investment, even as profits and market values climb.</p>\n\n<p>Why has capacity utilization fallen so much over the past half-century? It’s not entirely clear, but what economists call “structural economic rigidities” – things such as regulatory hurdles, labor market frictions or shifts in cost structure – seem to be part of the answer. These factors can drag businesses into a state of chronic underuse, especially after recessions. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t just an academic debate. The implications are profound, whether you closely follow Wall Street or just enjoy armchair economic policy debates. For one thing, this dynamic might help explain why tax cuts haven’t spurred investment the way supporters have hoped.</p>\n\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text/eh\">2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which slashed the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and introduced <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/full-expensing/\">full expensing</a> for equipment investments. Supporters promised a wave of new investment. </p>\n\n<p>But when my colleague and I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">looked at the numbers</a>, we found the opposite. In the four years before the tax cuts, publicly traded U.S. firms had an aggregate investment rate, including intangibles, of 13.9%. In the four years after the tax cut, the average investment rate fell to 12.4% – in other words, no evidence of a bump. </p>\n\n<p>Where did those liberated cash flows go? Instead of plowing this newfound cash after the tax cuts into new projects, many companies funneled it into <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\">stock buybacks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, this makes sense. If a company has excess capacity, the incentive to invest should be more muted, even if new machines are suddenly cheaper thanks to tax breaks. If the demand isn’t there, why buy them?</p>\n\n<p>Even with the most generous tax incentives, the core challenge remains: You can’t force-feed investment into an economy already swimming in excess capacity. If companies don’t see real, scalable demand, tax breaks alone aren’t likely to unlock a new era of business spending.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn’t mean tax policy doesn’t matter – it does, especially for smaller firms with real growth prospects. But for the large, well-established firms that make up the lion’s share of the economy, the bigger challenge is demand. Rather than trying to stimulate even more investment, policymakers should prioritize understanding why demand is sagging relative to supply and reducing economic rigidities where they can. That way, the capacity generated by new investment has somewhere useful to go.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260661/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Ikenberry does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And ahead of the shutdown, President Donald Trump suggested that a prolonged lapse in funding <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/government-shutdown-nears-with-no-deal-washington-2025-09-30/\">could open the door to “irreversible” changes</a>, such as reducing parts of the federal workforce.</p>\n\n<p>The shutdown marks another difficult moment this year for a federal workforce that has so far <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shed-300000-workers-this-year-trumps-hr-chief-forecasts-2025-08-14/\">shed more than 300,000 jobs</a>. This is largely due to ongoing Trump administration efforts to downsize parts of the federal government and restructure or largely eliminate certain government agencies with the stated aim of increasing efficiency. </p>\n\n<p>As a team of financial economists who study labor markets and public sector employment and have examined millions of federal personnel records spanning such government shutdowns in the past, we have found that the consequences reach far beyond the now-familiar images of closed national parks and stalled federal services. Indeed, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3962279\">based on our study</a> of an October 2013 shutdown during which about 800,000 <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/help/faq/1032\">federal employees were furloughed for 16 days</a>, shutdowns leave an enduring negative effect on the federal workforce, reshaping its composition and weakening its performance for years to come.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zF55F0Y3zD8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What happens to workers</h2>\n\n<p>Millions of Americans interact with the federal government every day in ways both big and small. More than <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60419\">one-third of U.S. national spending</a> is routed through government programs, including Medicare and Social Security. Federal workers <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">manage national parks</a>, draft environmental regulations and help keep air travel safe. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever one’s political leanings, if the goal is a government that handles these responsibilities effectively, then attracting and retaining a talented workforce is essential.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the ability of the federal government to do so may be increasingly difficult, in part because prolonged shutdowns can have hidden effects.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress fails to pass appropriations, <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/guidance-for-shutdown-furloughs.pdf\">federal agencies must furlough employees</a> whose jobs are not deemed “excepted” – sometimes commonly referred to as essential. Those excepted employees keep working, while others are barred from working or even volunteering until funding resumes. Furlough status reflects funding sources and mission categories, not an individual’s performance, so it confers no signal about an employee’s future prospects and primarily acts as a shock to morale.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, furloughs do not create long-term wealth losses; back pay has always been granted and, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12251\">since 2019, is legally guaranteed</a>. Employees therefore recover their pay even though they may face real <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-ut-state-wire-north-america-5d95c567185f4592b4a6e59fa9317f7c\">financial strain in the short run</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A cynical observer might call furloughs a paid vacation, yet the data tells a different story. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A sign in front of a national memorial.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C16%2C1024%2C577&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692912/original/file-20250925-56-k1jkgv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">National Parks are among the federal services that typically close during a shutdown, as happened in 2013.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ShutdownTheAverageDay/9f7fe2fb32e14f85a59a0a90edc4401c/photo\">AP Photo/Susan Walsh</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Immediate consequences, longer-term effects</h2>\n\n<p>Using extensive administrative records on federal civilian workers from the October 2013 shutdown, we tracked how this shock to morale rippled through government operations. Employees exposed to furloughs <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3962279\">were 31% more likely to leave their jobs</a> within one year. </p>\n\n<p>These departures were not quickly replaced, forcing agencies to rely on costly temporary workers and leading to measurable declines in core functions such as payment accuracy, legal enforcement and patenting activity. </p>\n\n<p>Further, we found that this exodus builds over the first two years after the shutdown and then settles into a permanently lower headcount, implying a durable loss of human capital. The shock to morale is more pronounced among young, female and highly educated professionals with plenty of outside options. Indeed, our analysis of survey data from a later 2018-2019 shutdown confirms that morale, not income loss, drives the exits. </p>\n\n<p>Employees who felt most affected reported a sharp drop in agency, control and recognition, and they were far more likely to plan a departure. </p>\n\n<p>The effect of the motivation loss is striking. Using a simple economic model where workers can be expected to value both cash and purpose, we estimate that the drop in intrinsic motivation after a shutdown would require a roughly 10% wage raise to offset. </p>\n\n<h2>Policy implications</h2>\n\n<p>Some people have argued that this outflow of employees amounts to a necessary trimming, a way to shrink government by a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24562740\">so-called starving of the beast</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But the evidence paints a different picture. Agencies hit hardest by furloughs turned to temporary staffing firms to fill the gaps. Over the two years after the shutdown we analyzed, these agencies spent about US$1 billion more on contractors than they saved in payroll. </p>\n\n<p>The costs go beyond replacement spending, as government performance also suffers. Agencies that were more <a href=\"https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov\">affected by the shutdown recorded higher rates</a> of inaccurate federal payments for several years. Even after partial recovery, losses amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars that taxpayers never recouped. </p>\n\n<p>Other skill-intensive functions declined as well. Legal enforcement fell in agencies that became short of experienced attorneys, and patenting activity dropped in science and engineering agencies after key inventors left. </p>\n\n<p>Official estimates of shutdown costs <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12248\">typically focus on near-term GDP effects</a> and back pay. But our findings show that an even bigger bill comes later in the form of higher employee turnover, higher labor costs to fill gaps, and measurable losses in productivity. </p>\n\n<p>Shutdowns are blunt, recurring shocks that demoralize the public workforce and erode performance. These costs spill over to everyone who relies on government services. If the public wants efficient, accountable public institutions, then we should all care about avoiding shutdowns.</p>\n\n<p>After an already turbulent year, it is unclear whether a shutdown would significantly add to the strain on federal employees or have a more limited effect, since many who were considering leaving have already left through buyouts or forced terminations this year. What is clear is that hundreds of thousands of federal employees will experience another period of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story was updated on Oct. 1, 2025, to include details of the shutdown.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265723/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But for CEOs, even scandals unrelated to business create doubt about their judgment, integrity and leadership. The result is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2922\">usually career-ending for the CEO</a>, research shows, and can create lasting harm for the company. </p>\n\n<p>We found that CEOs overwhelmingly exit in the wake of personal scandals – five times as often as CEOs who commit financial misconduct do, in fact. And strong business performance doesn’t tend to offer protection.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Hewlett-Packard’s Mark Hurd, who’s widely credited with turning around HP in the mid-2000s, was ousted following a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-hurd-jodie-fisher-hp-2011-12\">very visible personal misconduct scandal</a> 15 years ago. The fallout was swift: The company’s stock <a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-organisations/mark-hurd-affair\">fell nearly 10%</a> immediately after the announcement, and with leadership in a tailspin, it dropped more than 40% within a year.</p>\n\n<h2>Why bad numbers come with better odds</h2>\n\n<p>Companies are also routinely accused of “cooking the books.” In recent months, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/716c4ad5-e8fa-4a34-afba-9fb2d1db019d\">several firms have been forced</a> <a href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-qmco/quantum/news/quantum-qmco-examining-valuation-after-financial-restatement\">to restate their earnings</a> <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428860927/en/Evolv-Technology-Completes-Restatement-of-Previously-Issued-Financial-Statements-and-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Financial-Results\">after their financial statements</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/discover-financial-services-to-restate-sec-filings-on-credit-card-misclassification-c7ead7f1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhVGxgVgu8vNzSQNDZR9Sa6pgPc6vxFZ1AMBgIUSWypD2QYIXnIezy6S3L8exQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d315dd&amp;gaa_sig=VQSQpHJ97axoVXr6iYUK63DFmupDck-pAQqqvonDKHGWIsTL1nWE_BPl8p_T7Mfk0ylmwPHvCp3v2IxYLT3xEw%3D%3D\">didn’t add up</a>. These scandals shake investor trust, trigger sharp drops in company stock and often lead to the chief financial officer’s departure – with some CEOs following suit.</p>\n\n<p>However, while cooking the books is considered a severe form of corporate misconduct, our research suggests that it has fewer job-ending repercussions for CEOs than personal scandals do. Roughly half of all CEOs implicated in financial scandals survive, we found – because, unlike in personal scandals, CEOs can often shift blame. </p>\n\n<p>We also found that CEOs dismissed due to financial scandals tend to be replaced with outside candidates, which has been shown to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(87)90065-1\">stabilize a company’s stock price</a> and lead to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(88)90053-0\">stronger long-term performance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It might be surprising to learn that a CEO’s personal misconduct can come at a greater cost – both to the business and the executive – than outright financial fraud. Is corporate America overestimating the importance of CEOs’ private behavior? Or is it underestimating the importance of cooking the books?</p>\n\n<p>While I don’t have answers to these questions, I think our findings show the need for more discussion – and more research.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265725/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span> I have received funding from Deloitte for a separate project on sociopolitical activism. </span></em></p>",

Sharing jokes, sarcastic quips, ironic memes and witty anecdotes, the advice goes, will make you more likable, ease stress, strengthen teams, spark creativity and even signal leadership potential.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ksUPFN0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We are</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQhB8gYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">professors of marketing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i_7B_84AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and management</a> who study humor and workplace dynamics. Our own research – and a growing body of work by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101698\">other scholars</a> – shows that it’s harder to be funny than most people think. The downside of cracking a bad joke is often larger than what you might gain by landing a good one.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to tell sidesplitting jokes to make humor work for you. You can learn to think like a comedian instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Humor is risky business</h2>\n\n<p>Comedy works by bending and breaking norms – and when those rules aren’t broken in just the right way, it’s more likely to harm your reputation than to help your team.</p>\n\n<p>We developed the “<a href=\"https://humorresearchlab.com/benign-violation-theory/\">benign violation theory</a>” to explain what makes things funny – and why attempts at humor so often backfire, especially in the workplace. Essentially, humor arises when something is both wrong and OK at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>People find jokes funny when they break rules while seeming harmless. Miss one of those ingredients when you tell a joke and your audience won’t appreciate it. When it’s all benign and there’s no violation, you get yawns. When it’s all violation and not benign, you could end up triggering outrage. </p>\n\n<p>It’s hard enough to get laughs in the darkness of a comedy club. Under fluorescent office lights, that razor-thin line becomes even harder to walk. What feels wrong but OK to one colleague can feel simply wrong to another, especially across differences in seniority, culture, gender or even the mood they’re in. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PhGe50BXb2M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The hit sitcom ‘The Office’ pokes fun at the cringeworthy jokes cracked by a hapless boss.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An advertising study</h2>\n\n<p>In our experiments, when everyday people are asked to “be funny,” most attempts land flat or cross lines.</p>\n\n<p>In a humorous caption contest with business students, described in Peter McGraw’s book on global humor practices, “<a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/books/the-humor-code/\">The Humor Code</a>,” the captions weren’t particularly funny to begin with. However, the ones that were rated by judges as the most funny were often also rated the most distasteful. </p>\n\n<p>Being funny without being offensive is of paramount importance. This is particularly true for women, as a robust literature shows women face harsher backlash than men for behavior seen as offensive or norm-violating such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02079.x\">expressing anger</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.008\">acting dominantly</a> or even “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.001\">making asks</a>” in negotiations. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_s8CUzXQ4G0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Don’t be that guy.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>You might end up getting no respect</h2>\n\n<p>Research by other scholars who examine leader and manager behavior in organizations tells a similar story. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, managers who used humor effectively were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000079\">seen as more confident and competent</a>, boosting their status. Yet when their attempts misfired, those same managers lost status and credibility. Other <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101698\">researchers have found</a> that failed humor doesn’t just hurt a manager’s status – it also makes employees less likely to respect that manager, seek their advice, or trust their leadership.</p>\n\n<p>Even when jokes land, humor can backfire. In <a href=\"https://www.msi.org/working-papers/when-humor-backfires-revisiting-the-relationship-between-humorous-marketing-and-brand-attitude/\">one study</a>, marketing students instructed to write “funny” copy for advertisements wrote ads that were funnier, but also less effective, than students instructed to write “creative” or “persuasive” copy.</p>\n\n<p>Another study found that bosses who joke too often <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2022.0195\">push employees into pretending to be amused</a>, which drains energy, reduces job satisfaction and increases burnout. And the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/03/making-jokes-during-a-presentation-helps-men-but-hurts-women\">risks are higher for women</a> due to a double standard. When women use humor in presentations, they are often judged as being less capable and having lower status than men.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that telling a great joke rarely gets you a promotion. And cracking a bad one can jeopardize your job – even if you’re <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abc-suspends-jimmy-kimmel-live-over-kimmels-charlie-kirk-comments/\">not a talk show host</a> who earns a living making people laugh.</p>\n\n<h2>Flip the script</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of trying to be funny on the job, we recommend that you focus on what we call “thinking funny” – as described in another of McGraw’s books, “<a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/books/shtick-to-business/\">Shtick to Business</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>“The best ideas come as jokes,” <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/233814-the-best-ideas-come-as-jokes-make-your-thinking-as\">advertising legend David Ogilvy once said</a>. “Try to make your thinking as funny as possible.”</p>\n\n<p>But Ogilvy wasn’t telling executives to crack jokes in meetings. He was encouraging employees to think like comedians by flipping expectations, leveraging their networks and finding their niche.</p>\n\n<p>Comics often lead you one way and then flip the script. Comedian Henny Youngman, a master of one-liners, <a href=\"https://www.quotationspage.com/quote/1054.html\">famously quipped</a>, “When I read about the dangers of drinking, I gave up … reading.” The business version of this convention is to challenge an obvious assumption.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Patagonia’s “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaign, which the outdoor gear company rolled out Black Friday in 2011 as a full-page ad in The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/070715/success-patagonias-marketing-strategy.asp\">paradoxically boosted sales</a> by calling out overconsumption.</p>\n\n<p>To apply this method, pick a stale assumption your team holds, such as that adding features to a product always improves it or that having more meetings will lead to smoother coordination, and ask, “What if the opposite were true?” </p>\n\n<p>You’ll discover options that standard brainstorming misses.</p>\n\n<h2>Create a chasm</h2>\n\n<p>When comedian <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/bill-burr-in-conversation.html\">Bill Burr has his fans in stitches</a>, he knows some people won’t find his jokes funny – and he doesn’t try to win them over. </p>\n\n<p>We’ve observed that many of the best comics don’t try to please everyone. They succeed by deliberately narrowing their audience. And we also find that businesses that do the same build stronger brands.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when Nebraska’s tourism board embraced “<a href=\"https://visitnebraska.com/press-releases/nebraska-tourism-launches-springsummer-campaign-nebraska-honestly-its-not-everyone\">Honestly, it’s not for everyone</a>” in a 2019 campaign, targeting out-of-state visitors, web traffic jumped 43%.</p>\n\n<p>Some people want hot tea. Others want iced tea. Serving warm tea satisfies no one. Likewise, you can succeed in business by deciding whom your idea is for, and whom it’s not for, then tailoring your product, policy or presentation accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2>Cooperate to innovate</h2>\n\n<p>Stand-up may look like a solo act. But comics depend on feedback – punch-ups from fellow comedians and reactions from audiences – iterating jokes in the same way lean startups may innovate new products.</p>\n\n<p>Building successful teams at work means listening before speaking, making your partners look good, and balancing roles. Improv teacher <a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/talking-pirates-and-robots-with-billy-merritt/\">Billy Merritt has described</a> three types of improvisers. Pirates are risk-takers. Robots are structure builders. Ninjas are adept at both, taking risks and building structures.</p>\n\n<p>A team designing a new app, for instance, needs all three: Pirates to propose bold features, robots to streamline the interface, and ninjas to bridge gaps. Empowering everyone in these roles leads to braver ideas with fewer blind spots.</p>\n\n<h2>Gifts aren’t universal</h2>\n\n<p>Telling someone to “be funny” is like telling them to “be musical.” Many of us can keep a beat, but few have what it takes to become rock stars. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why we argue that it’s smarter to think like a comedian than to try to act like one.</p>\n\n<p>By reversing assumptions, cooperating to innovate, and creating chasms, professionals can generate fresh solutions and stand out – without becoming an office punchline.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265036/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Indeed, for us the puzzle was why they had flourished in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>To examine their rise and fall, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70000\">recently conducted a research project</a> that encompassed interviews with more than 80 executives from various financial institutions, activist organizations and oil and gas companies. </p>\n\n<h2>Powerful allies grasped climate risks</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/\">Net-Zero Banking Alliance</a> was founded in 2021. Members agreed to limit lending to carbon-intense sectors so that total greenhouse gas emissions from companies in the banks’ loan portfolios are close to zero by 2050. </p>\n\n<p>This target aligned with the goals of the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</a> but was not binding and lacked clear shorter-term targets and plans. Similar net-zero networks were established for insurance, asset management and other financial areas, all under the umbrella of the <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/\">United Nations Environment Program’s Finance Initiative</a>. Over the past 16 months, the <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-pauses-activities/\">insurance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ipe.com/news/net-zero-asset-managers-initiative-halts-activities/10128152.article\">asset managers’</a> alliances have also suspended their activities.</p>\n\n<p>These net-zero alliances were built on the <a href=\"https://iacpm.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IACPM-Oliver-Wyman-2018-Study-on-Climate-Risk-Awareness-White-Paper.pdf?\">premise that climate risk equals financial risk</a> and that the challenge requires a collective response. Their goal was to leverage the power of finance to push companies to decarbonize their products and processes.</p>\n\n<p>Key financial regulators, central banks and a few of the largest asset managers propelled these alliances because they perceived that climate change poses serious long-term systemic risks to markets and economies around the world. Influential figures such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b57ece-0c31-4f42-9229-c8981bc9fd34\">Larry Fink</a>, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and former <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability.pdf\">Bank of England head Mark Carney</a>, now the prime minister of Canada, lent legitimacy to these initiatives. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ceres.org/banking\">Some environmental groups</a> also supported these alliances as a smart strategy to pressure companies on climate. Many other financial institutions then joined the net-zero bandwagon, but our research revealed that they didn’t do so because of concern about climate-related financial risks. Rather, they felt an array of pressure from peers, investors, activists, regulators and even their families. </p>\n\n<p>Many people we interviewed mentioned reputational risk as a key driver and saw a low-carbon transition as inevitable, driven by regulation, technological innovation and consumer demand. This was the Biden era, with billions of dollars flowing to clean energy through the <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28112024/clean-energy-inflation-reduction-act-uncertainty/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The burgeoning field also spawned a specialized but lucrative industry of data providers and consultants who actively marketed carbon management, disclosure and broader sustainability services. The <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/esg-software-market-report\">global market for sustainability data and software</a> was estimated at more than US$1 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. </p>\n\n<p>Climate strategy and sustainability reporting was the fastest-growing business sector for <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sustainability-consulting-services-market\">accounting and consulting firms</a>. And asset managers were happy to collect <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-07/many-esg-funds-are-just-expensive-s-p-500-indexers?\">higher fees for funds screened for sustainability</a> – even though these funds have not outperformed the broader market.</p>\n\n<p>These vested interests spurred continued expansion of net-zero networks. Indeed, at its peak in 2024, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-pauses-activities/\">included over 140 members globally</a> with $74 trillion in estimated total assets, representing over 40% of global banking assets. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"wind turbine components await assembly on a pier in connecticut\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Trump administration has canceled several offshore wind farm projects, such as one that’s nearly complete and intended to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut – though its fate is still in court.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateTrumpOffshoreWind/2f899d8d10c14eca8cc5f322a8c94c33/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political backlash</h2>\n\n<p>Given the size and scope of these net-zero networks, what triggered their rapid collapse? </p>\n\n<p>One major factor, of course, was the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/leonard-leo-consumers-research-esg-climate/683581/\">political backlash</a> against anything connected with climate action and sustainable investing following the 2024 election of President Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p>Finance <a href=\"https://www.esgdive.com/news/state-gop-finance-officials-press-us-asset-managers-denounce-esg-climate-blackrock-vanguard-jpmorgan/756716/\">officials in more than 20 U.S. states</a> have demanded that major asset managers restrict the use of environment, social and governance benchmarks, accusing them of eroding “traditional fiduciary duty” and claiming they hurt investors.</p>\n\n<p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-attorneys-general-accuse-net-zero-standards-setters-of-running-climate-cartel-5893d34e?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\">23 Republican attorneys general</a> accused organizations created to set standards for corporate climate disclosures of operating an anticompetitive “climate cartel”  and violating antitrust laws.</p>\n\n<h2>Fossil fuels – too lucrative to abandon</h2>\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/republicans-anti-esg-attack-may-be-silencing-insurers-but-it-isnt-changing-their-pro-climate-business-decisions-206922\">political pressure in the U.S.</a> has indeed been intense, the <a href=\"https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/blackrock-exit-net-zero-asset-managers-suspends-activities\">collapse of net-zero networks</a> and the broader <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-corporate-climate-broken-promises/?embedded-checkout=true\">corporate retreat from climate commitments</a> is largely due to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aebdb5ac-7e97-425e-8af3-e086488255c5\">continued profitability of fossil fuels</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FP_20210623_industrial_gross_v2.pdf\">high costs and risks of deep decarbonization</a>. Investors and banks, of course, want to keep on financing profitable companies and avoid pressuring their clients to take risky measures. </p>\n\n<p>Oil companies such as BP and Shell that had relatively <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianstadler/2024/04/30/shell-is-paying-the-price-for-sustainability-while-exxon-profits-soar/?\">strong climate targets suffered financially</a> as a result, prompting them to retreat from these targets and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91253071/bp-shell-backtracked-climate-goals-2024-heres-why\">shift capital</a> from renewable projects back toward fossil fuels. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55020\">High energy prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war</a> made the sector even more lucrative. Low-carbon fuels and processes for industries such as aviation, steel and cement are <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/industry-and-buildings/the-cost-of-decarbonizing-industry-is-high-but-within-reach/?\">still very expensive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Trump administration is abolishing most <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-trump-administration-and-congress-attacks-on-wind-power-are-killing-thousands-of-jobs-and-risk-thousands-more/?\">subsidies for clean energy and freezing permits for offshore wind</a>, while easing regulations and opening more land for oil and gas exploration. </p>\n\n<p>These economic incentives made it hard for the banking alliance to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/commodities/oil-gas-companies-continue-to-find-financing\">reduce financing for fossil fuels</a> – and <a href=\"https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BOCC_2025_FINAL4.pdf\">the money has kept on flowing</a> into oil and gas projects.</p>\n\n<p>European banks that sharply cut funding to fossil fuel companies saw their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51662-6\">business diverted to other banks</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.akingump.com/a/web/vXurKbioYj87DzhQCgcQ47/trends-in-oil-and-gas-2025-akin-pdf-v6.pdf\">private, nonbank sources of finance</a>, which has soared in the past two years. Facing this loss of business, major banks’ <a href=\"https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BOCC_2025_FINAL4.pdf\">lending to oil and gas companies surged</a> in 2024, driving loans to a three-year high of $869 billion.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"lywCa\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lywCa/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The costs of membership in the net-zero alliances also increased over time, with the adoption of <a href=\"https://esgnews.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-tightens-guidelines-for-banks-climate-targets/\">stricter standards</a> that called for specific plans and timelines for ending fossil fuel financing entirely. The new standards also required loan recipients to <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/scope-3-emissions-top-supply-chain-sustainability-challenges?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">disclose Scope 3 emissions</a>, which include emissions from a company’s suppliers and customers.</p>\n\n<p>Managers in financial institutions told us that the increasingly complex and demanding requirements were generating strong pushback from their clients. We also heard that membership was turning from a reputational asset to a liability, as <a href=\"https://beyond-coal.jp/en/documents/bocc2025/\">activist organizations called out the hypocrisy</a> of continued fossil fuel lending despite their commitments to phasing it out.</p>\n\n<h2>Ignoring climate change’s long-term risks</h2>\n\n<p>Although banks are rushing back to finance fossil fuel projects, these loans typically have long terms of 10 to 25 years. This means they carry the risk that an eventual transition to clean energy will make these projects <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2022/699532/IPOL_STU%282022%29699532_EN.pdf?\">worthless, “stranded assets</a>.” One study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01356-y\">estimates that investors</a> are currently exposed to more than $1 trillion in potential losses. </p>\n\n<p>Why do banks often ignore these risks? </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Our interviewees mentioned the organizational silos that separate analysts who assess climate risks from the loan originators. In other words, the employees deciding where to lend money may not be talking to the team that best understands the long-term risks. Moreover, current risk assessment tools are quite crude and don’t generate the quantitative metrics that loan underwriters want.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4276781\">loans are increasingly repackaged and sold</a>, or securitized, into the larger corporate debt market, obscuring the risks. </p>\n\n<h2>Climate risks are real and growing</h2>\n\n<p>The Net-Zero Banking Alliance isn’t disappearing entirely. The group is currently <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/media/nzba-update-august-2025/\">deciding on whether to restructure</a> into a much weaker “framework initiative” that provides voluntary guidance instead of binding commitments. </p>\n\n<p>And some banks leaving the alliance have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/net-zero-banking-alliance-suspends-activities-amid-wave-of-departures-fc1beef1?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stated that they will maintain their climate goals</a> and sustainability policies.</p>\n\n<p>But climate risks are real and growing. The <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/press/11december2024-climate-risk-cost-of-inaction\">Boston Consulting Group recently estimated</a> that just the physical risks – floods, drought and wildfires – could cost companies up to 25% of their profits by 2050 and substantially cut global GDP. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/climate-transition-impact-framework-ctif-planning-for-a-sustainable-and-inclusive-future#/\">transition to a low-carbon economy</a> will cost trillions of dollars and create massive disruption – as well as opportunities – as new technologies and companies emerge. The longer that action is delayed, the greater the risks to the planet – and of more drastic shocks to the global economy and financial system.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265176/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David L Levy receives funding from the BSF, the Bi-national  US-Israel Science Foundation</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rami Kaplan receives funding from the BSF, the Bi-national US-Israel Science Foundation</span></em></p>",
