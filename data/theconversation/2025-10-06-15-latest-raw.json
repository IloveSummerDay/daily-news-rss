If it is resolved quickly, the costs will be small, but if it drags on, it could send the U.S. economy into a tailspin. </p>\n\n<p>That’s because the economy is already in a precarious state, with the labor market struggling, consumers losing confidence and uncertainty mounting.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/expert/john-w-diamond\">economist who studies public finance</a>, I closely follow how government policies affect the economy. Let me explain how a prolonged shutdown could affect the economy – and why it could be a tipping point to recession.</p>\n\n<h2>Direct impacts from a government shutdown</h2>\n\n<p>The partial government shutdown <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/02/us/trump-government-shutdown\">began on Oct. 1, 2025</a>, as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a deal on funding some portion of the federal government. A partial shutdown means that some funding bills have been approved, entitlement spending continues since it does not rely on annual appropriations, and some workers are deemed necessary and stay on the job unpaid.</p>\n\n<p>While most of the 20 shutdowns that occurred from 1976 through 2024 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\">lasted only a few days</a> to a week, there are signs the current one <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-quick-compromise-to-the-first-government-shutdown-in-nearly-7-years-seems-unlikely-266450\">may not be resolved so quickly</a>. The economy would definitely take a direct hit to gross domestic product from a lengthy shutdown, but it’s the indirect impacts that could be more harmful. </p>\n\n<p>The most recent shutdown, which extended over the 2018-2019 winter holidays and lasted 35 days, was the longest in U.S. history. After it ended, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54937\">estimated the partial shutdown delayed</a> approximately US$18 billion in federal discretionary spending, which translated into an $11 billion reduction in real GDP. </p>\n\n<p>Most of that lost output was made up later once the shutdown ended, the CBO noted. It estimated that the permanent losses were about $3 billion – a drop in the bucket for the <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/gdp-update\">$30 trillion U.S. economy</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a man in a uniform locks a gate on a road into a park\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many parks, such as Florida’s Everglades National Park, were closed as a result of the shutdown.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/APTOPIXGovernmentShutdown/ad3339c153c142eeb844c34ec97be763/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The indirect and more lasting impacts</h2>\n\n<p>The full impact may depend to a large extent on the psychology of the average consumer. </p>\n\n<p>Recent data suggests that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/us-consumer-confidence-falls-to-five-month-low-on-job-market\">consumer confidence is falling</a> as the stagnation in the labor market becomes more clear. Business confidence has been mixed as the <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence\">manufacturing index</a> continues to indicate the sector is in contraction, while <a href=\"https://www.economy.com/united-states/business-confidence/seasonally-adjusted\">other business confidence measures</a> indicate mixed expectations about the future.</p>\n\n<p>If the shutdown drags on, the psychological effects may lead to a larger loss of confidence among consumers and businesses. Given that consumer spending accounts for 70% of economic activity, a fall in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/understanding-consumer-confidence-index/#:%7E:text=7-,CCI%20Interpretation,action%20to%20stimulate%20the%20economy.\">consumer confidence</a> could signal a turning point in the economy.</p>\n\n<p>These indirect effects are in addition to the direct impact of lost income for federal workers and those that operate on federal contracts, which leads to reductions in consumption and production.  </p>\n\n<p>The risk of significant government layoffs, beyond the usual furloughs, could deepen the economic damage. Extensive layoffs would shift the losses from a temporary delay to a more permanent loss of income and human capital, reducing aggregate demand and potentially increasing unemployment spillovers into the private sector. </p>\n\n<p>In short, while shutdowns that end quickly tend to inflict modest, mostly recoverable losses, a protracted shutdown – especially one involving layoffs of a significant number of government workers – could inflict larger, lasting impacts on the economy.</p>\n\n<h2>US economy is already in distress</h2>\n\n<p>This is all occurring as the U.S. labor market is flashing warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Payrolls <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">grew by only 22,000</a> in August, with July and June estimates revised down by 21,000. This follows payroll growth of only 73,000 in July, with May and June estimates revised down by 258,000. \nIn addition, preliminary annual revisions to the employment data show the economy gained <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prebmk.nr0.htm\">911,000 fewer jobs</a> in the previous year than had been reported. </p>\n\n<p>Long-term unemployment is also rising, with 1.8 million people out of work for more than 27 weeks – nearly a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2025/number-of-long-term-unemployed-was-1-8-million-in-july-2025.htm\">total number of unemployed individuals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, AI adoption and cost-cutting could further reduce labor demand, while an aging workforce and lower immigration shrink labor supply. Fed Chair Jerome Powell refers to this as a “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250822a.htm\">curious kind of balance</a>” in the labor market.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the job market appears to have come to a screeching halt, making it difficult for recent graduates to find work. Recent graduate unemployment – that is, those who are 22 to 27 years old – is now <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693\">5.3% </a> relative to the total unemployment rate of 4.3%.</p>\n\n<p>The latest data from the <a href=\"https://mediacenter.adp.com/2025-10-01-ADP-National-Employment-Report-Private-Sector-Employment-Shed-32,000-Jobs-in-September-Annual-Pay-was-Up-4-5\">ADP employment report</a>, which measures only private company data, shows that the economy lost 32,000 jobs in September. That’s the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">biggest decline</a> in 2½ years. While that’s worrying, economists like me usually wait for the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers to come out to confirm the accuracy of the payroll processing firm’s report.</p>\n\n<p>The government data that was supposed to come out on Oct. 3 might have offered a possible counterpoint to the bad ADP news, but due to the shutdown BLS will not be releasing the report.</p>\n\n<h2>Problems Fed rate cuts can’t fix</h2>\n\n<p>This will only increase the uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. And it adds to the uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariffs as well as the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-sets-10-tariff-lumber-imports-higher-rates-wooden-products-2025-09-30/\">newly imposed tariffs</a> on lumber, furniture and other goods. </p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">Fed is expected to lower</a> interest rates at least two more times this year to stimulate consumer and business spending following its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fed-rate-cut-is-attempt-to-prevent-recession-without-sending-prices-soaring-265370\">September quarter-point cut</a>. This raises the risk of reigniting inflation, but the cooling labor market is a more immediate concern for the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>While lower short-term rates may help at the margin, I believe they cannot resolve the deeper challenges, such as massive government <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-treasury-statement/summary-of-receipts-outlays-and-the-deficit-surplus-of-the-u-s-government\">deficits</a> and <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/\">debt</a>, tight <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ongoing-inflation-concerns-reshaping-spending-135500814.html\">household budgets</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cbreim.com/insights/articles/digging-out-of-the-us-housing-affordability-crisis\">housing affordability crisis</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shrinking-labor-force-scariest-number-job-market-hiring-unemployment-2025-8\">shrinking labor force</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The question now is not will the Fed cut rates, because it likely will, but whether that cut will help, particularly if the shutdown lasts weeks or more. Monetary policy alone cannot overcome the uncertainty created by tariffs, the lack of fiscal restraint, companies focused on cutting costs by replacing people with technology, the impact of the shutdown and the fears of consumers about the future.</p>\n\n<p>Lower interest rates may buy time, but they won’t solve these structural problems facing the U.S. economy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266327/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John W.

      "content": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">Shohei Ohtani</a> stepped onto the field at the Tokyo Dome in March 2025, he wasn’t just playing a game – he was carrying forward more than <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/featured/japan-baseball-history\">100 years of baseball ties</a> between the U.S. and Japan. </p>\n\n<p>That history was front and center when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs opened their 2025 regular season <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/international/events/tokyo-series\">facing off in the Tokyo Series</a> on March 18 and 19. The two games featured <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/seiya-suzuki-673548\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shota-imanaga-684007\">players</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/yoshinobu-yamamoto-808967\">from</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/player/roki-sasaki-808963\">Japan</a>, capping a slate of events that included four exhibition games against Japanese professional teams. </p>\n\n<p>It was a massive financial success. Marking MLB’s first return to Tokyo since 2019, the series generated over <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/03/18/manfred-expects-tokyo-series-to-set-event-records\">US$35 million in ticket sales and sponsorship revenue</a> and <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/tokyo-series-merchandise-sets-sales-040000367.html\">$40 million in merchandise sales</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNIpKhTE24M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The first game of the Tokyo Series broke viewership records in Japan.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For MLB, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-viewership-increases-usa-japan-streaming-2025\">significant viewership growth this season</a>, it was proof that its investment in Japan and <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-global-reach-world-baseball-classic\">international baseball</a> over the past three decades has been paying off. </p>\n\n<h2>Baseball’s early journey to Japan</h2>\n\n<p>Baseball, which is by far the most popular sport in Japan, was introduced to the nation <a href=\"https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g02195/\">during the Meiji Restoration</a> in the late 19th century. </p>\n\n<p>American baseball promoters were quick to see the potential of the Japanese market, touring the country <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-1908-reach-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">as early as 1908</a>. The most famous such tour took place in 1934 and featured <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/murder-espionage-and-baseball-the-1934-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">a number of American League All-Stars</a>, including Babe Ruth and catcher Moe Berg, who was later revealed to be <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/moe-bergs-life-in-baseball\">a U.S. spy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That trip had a long legacy. The U.S. All-Stars faced a team called <a href=\"https://japanball.com/baseball/npb-teams/tokyo-yomiuri-giants/?srsltid=AfmBOoqWKZEd6wiVM0TJkiAA6rFkQocx3feJ2uD3sUE_1i9IqfCDG40I\">The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club</a>, which, a year later, barnstormed in the United States. When they played the San Francisco Seals, the Seals’ manager, Lefty O’Doul – who later trained baseball players in Japan – suggested a name change to better promote the team for an American audience. </p>\n\n<p>Commenting that Tokyo is the New York of Japan, O’Doul suggested they take on one of their team names. And since “Yankee” is a uniquely American term, The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club was reborn as the Tokyo (Yomiuri) Giants. </p>\n\n<p>When the Giants returned to Japan, the Japanese Baseball League was formed, which was <a href=\"https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/baseball-in-japan-and-the-us-history-culture-and-future-prospects\">reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball in 1950</a>. The Giants have gone on to dominate the NPB, winning 22 Japan Series and producing <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-who-are-the-yomiuri-giants-all-to-know-about-them-ahead-of-the-tokyo-series-two-thousand-twenty-five/\">Sadaharu Oh</a>, who hit 868 home runs during his illustrious career.</p>\n\n<h2>Breaking into MLB</h2>\n\n<p>The first Japanese-born MLB player, <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/inside-pitch/murakamis-big-league-debut-changed-the-game\">Masanori Murakami</a>, debuted for the San Francisco Giants in September 1964. But his arrival wound up sparking a contractual tug-of-war between the NPB and MLB. To prevent future disputes, the two leagues signed <a href=\"https://sportslitigationalert.com/the-evolution-of-the-united-states-japanese-player-contract-agreement\">an agreement in 1967</a> that essentially blocked MLB teams from signing Japanese players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the 1990s, this agreement became untenable, as some Japanese players in NPB became frustrated by their lack of negotiating power. After the <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kintetsu_Buffaloes\">Kintetsu Buffaloes</a> refused to give Hideo Nomo a multiyear contract after the 1994 season, his agent found a loophole in the “<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/hideo-nomo-pioneered-path-to-mlb-in-1995\">voluntary retirement clause</a>” that would allow him to sign with an MLB franchise. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995. </p>\n\n<p>Nomo’s impact was immeasurable. His “tornado” windup and early success made him one of the most popular players in the major leagues, which was recovering from the cancellation of the World Series the previous year. In Japan, “<a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/hideo-nomo/\">Nomo fever</a>” took hold, with large crowds gathering television screens in public to watch him play, even though his games aired in the morning. <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-029_cf69d0f7-b1e5-41ec-8e79-ef3253c78aae.pdf\">Nomo helped drive Japanese sponsorship and television rights</a> as his first season ended with him winning National League Rookie of the Year.</p>\n\n<p>But within a few years, disputes over contracts soon showed the need for new rules. This ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-baseball-strengthened-relationship-between-united-states-japan-180968597/\">establishment of posting rules for NPB</a> players looking to transition to the major leagues. </p>\n\n<p>The rules have shifted some since they were set out in late 1998, but if a player declares their intention to leave NPB, then <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/japanese-posting-system\">MLB teams have a 45-day window to negotiate</a>. If the player from NPB is under 25 or has less than nine years of professional experience, they’re subject to the limited MLB signing pool for international players. Otherwise, they’re declared a free agent.</p>\n\n<h2>A wave of stars</h2>\n\n<p>The new rules led many more Japanese players to join major league baseball from Nippon Professional Baseball: Of the 81 Japanese players who’ve played in the majors, all but four played in NPB before their debut. Ichiro Suzuki, who became the first Japanese player <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/mariners/fans/ichiro-hall-of-fame\">inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, was also the first Japanese position player to make the leap.</p>\n\n<p>Other players, like Hideki Matsui, the only Japanese player to be named World Series MVP, continued the success. And <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/baseballs-two-way-players-from-babe-ruth-to-shohei-ohtani-and-2024-potential-draftees-like-jac-caglianone/\">then came Ohtani</a>, a two-way superstar who both hits and pitches, drawing comparisons to Babe Ruth. </p>\n\n<p>For MLB, Japanese players haven’t just boosted performance on the field – they’ve expanded its global fan base. The Dodgers brought in over <a href=\"https://www.foxla.com/sports/shohei-ohtani-made-120-million-dodgers\">$120 million in increased revenue in Ohtani’s first year alone</a>, easily covering his salary even with Ohtani signing the richest contract in baseball history. The franchise has also seen its value increase by at least <a href=\"https://www.sportspro.com/news/mlb-team-valuations-2025-yankees-dodgers-march-2025/\">23% to nearly $8 billion</a>. MLB has also seen a <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/mlb-unveils-2026-schedule-as-big-changes-loom-soon-after/\">significant increase in viewership</a> over the past two seasons, partially driven by the growing interest from Japan.</p>\n\n<p>As American sports leagues deal with an increasingly distracted, fragmented domestic audience, it’s not surprising that they’re looking abroad for growth. And as MLB teams prepare to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46139027/2025-mlb-free-agency-offseason-early-intel-contracts-schwarber-tucker-imai-bregman-alonso\">court another wave of Japanese stars this offseason</a>, it’s clear that its decades-long investment in Japan is paying off.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264668/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jared Bahir Browsh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",
