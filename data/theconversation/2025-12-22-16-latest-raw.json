This tragedy, discovered on Dec. 14, 2025, is also increasing the public’s interest in what happens when killers could inherit wealth from their victims. That’s because Nick Reiner, their son, was <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/live/rob-reiners-son-nick-makes-1st-court-appearance-after-being-charged-with-murder-in-deaths-of-his-parents-follow-live-updates-135653425.html\">charged with two counts of first-degree murder</a> four days after the couple’s deaths at their Los Angeles home.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What’s the ‘slayer rule’?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jaapl.org/content/43/3/369\">All states</a> have some form of a slayer rule that prevents killers from inheriting from their victims. While the rules differ slightly from state to state, they always bar murderers from profiting from their own crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, if you’re found guilty of killing someone or plead guilty to their murder, you can’t inherit anything from your victim’s estate.</p>\n\n<p>In some states, this might go beyond inheritance and apply to jointly held property, insurance policies and <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/inheritance/603880/6-of-the-best-assets-to-inherit\">other kinds of accounts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these slayer rules, including California’s, apply only to “<a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PROB&amp;sectionNum=250\">felonious and intentional</a>” killings, meaning that they don’t apply if you accidentally kill someone. Although there doesn’t have to be a guilty verdict by a judge or a jury, or a guilty plea from the accused, there must be some finding by a criminal or civil court of an intentional and felonious killing.</p>\n\n<p>These rules, known as slayer rules, have a long history in the United States. They became more prominent following <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/archives/riggs_palmer.htm\">an 1889 murder case</a> in New York state, in which a 16-year-old boy poisoned his grandfather to get an inheritance that was written into his grandfather’s will.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>How often are slayer rules invoked?</h2>\n\n<p>It’s hard to say for sure. As far as we know, nobody’s tried to keep track.</p>\n\n<p>Slayer rules come into play whenever someone who would otherwise inherit assets from an estate is convicted of or found liable for murder, and the slayer is entitled to inherit from the victim.</p>\n\n<p>These tragic cases almost always involve murders committed by relatives. Many of the high-profile ones have been tied to murders that occurred in California.</p>\n\n<p>Famous disinherited murderers include Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Californians known as the <a href=\"https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/article/menendez-brothers-financial-legacy-lessons-wealth-advisors\">Menendez brothers</a>. In 1996, a jury found them guilty of the first-degree murder of their parents, José and Mary Louise “Kitty” Menendez. The Menendez brothers’ parents, who were killed in 1989, had a fortune that today <a href=\"https://gokallaw.com/the-slayer-statute-in-california-and-the-menendez-inheritance/\">would be worth more than $35 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The brothers, who became <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/live-updates-lyle-menendez-brothers-parole/3768049/\">eligible for parole</a> but were denied it in 2025, have been in prison ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Once there has been a finding of an intentional and felonious killing, even if the slayer is later released on parole – or even if they serve no prison time at all – they would still not inherit anything.</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, that means if one or both of the Menendez brothers were to win parole in the future, they would still be ineligible to inherit any of their parents’ wealth upon their release from prison.</p>\n\n<p>California’s slayer rule also meant that salesman <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mom-to-get-lacis-life-insurance/\">Scott Peterson</a>, who was convicted of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/scott-peterson-new-evidence/\">killing his pregnant wife, Laci Peterson</a>, in 2002, couldn’t collect the money he would otherwise have been due from <a href=\"https://ocestatelawyers.com/how-the-slayer-statute-makes-killings-a-grave-mistake/\">her life insurance policy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Peterson has been in prison since 2005.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two young men, wearing prison garb, sit in a courtroom.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=473&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=473&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709985/original/file-20251219-56-8phh26.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=473&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Erik Menendez, left, and Lyle Menendez, seen standing trial for their parents’ murders, in 1994.

For example, a conviction for a lesser criminal offense, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1537-manslaughter-defined\">such as manslaughter</a>, might allow the accused – or their lawyers – to argue that the killing was unintentional.</p>\n\n<p>This exception could be relevant to the prosecution of the Reiners’ murders if it were to turn out that Nick Reiner’s defense can show that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/nick-reiner-insanity-defense-1236611210/\">substance abuse</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nick-reiner-was-diagnosed-schizophrenia-medication-was-adjusted-parent-rcna250176\">or schizophrenia</a> rendered him insane when he allegedly killed his parents at their Los Angeles home.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, under California law, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=254.&amp;nodeTreePath=3.7&amp;lawCode=PROB\">even if there is no conviction</a> the probate court administering the murder victim’s estate could still separately find that the killing was intentional and felonious.

And celebrities with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/legal-wrangling-over-estate-of-jimmy-buffett-turns-his-widows-huge-inheritance-into-a-cautionary-tale-259116\">valuable intellectual property rights</a>, such as copyrights from the Reiners’ many film and television properties, tend to establish trusts.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that, like many parents, the Reiners left <a href=\"https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1234870791/michele-reiner-net-worth/\">most of their fortune</a> – which reportedly was worth some US$200 million – to their children, including Nick, then California’s slayer statute may come into play.

That means what Nick Reiner might stand to inherit, if the slayer rule were to prove irrelevant in this case, is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Nor, with the investigation of the couple’s deaths still underway, can anyone make any assumptions about Nick’s innocence or guilt.</p>\n\n<p>And, as of mid-December 2025, an unnamed source was telling entertainment reporters that Nick Reiner’s <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/hidden-funding-source-behind-nick-120025040.html\">legal bills were being paid for</a> by the Reiner family.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272171/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The trailer literally writhes with snakes intercut amid scenes of emotional turmoil, religious ecstasy, orderly and disorderly dancing – and sex. Intense and sometimes menacing music underpins it all: the sounds of the enraptured, singing their way to a fantastic and unimaginable ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer is riveting and unsettling – just as the celibate Shakers were to the average observer during their American emergence in the 1780s.</p>\n\n<p>I sit on the Board of Trustees of <a href=\"https://hancockshakervillage.org/\">Hancock Shaker Village</a> in Massachusetts, where some of the film was shot, though I have not seen the film, which is due to be released on Christmas Day. I was the curator at Hancock from 2001 to 2009 and have studied the Shakers for more than 25 years, publishing <a href=\"https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/christian-goodwillie-shaker-religion-richard-mcnemar\">numerous books</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-48487-1_4\">and articles</a> on the sect.</p>\n\n<p>Fascination with the Shakers is enduring, as are they. The sect once had several thousand members; today, <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/08/25/maine-shaker-village-population-member-new-gloucester\">three Shakers remain</a>, practicing the faith at <a href=\"https://maineshakers.com/\">their village in Sabbathday Lake, Maine</a>, as they have since 1783. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zK_nzG36mk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Mona Fastvold’s film depicts the group’s early years in North America.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many characteristics of Shaker life and belief set them apart from other Protestant Christians, but their name derives from one of the most obvious. Early Shakers manifested the holy spirit that they believed dwelled within them by shaking violently in worship. While they called themselves “Believers,” <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/the-rhythms-of-shaker-dance-marked-the-shakers-as-other/\">observers dubbed them “Shakers</a>.” Members eventually adopted the name, although officially they are the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing.</p>\n\n<p>The Shakers developed unique worship practices in both music and dance that expressed their faith. Until the 1870s, Shaker music was monophonic, with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eIzQ7CUSkeU?si=IE2AXC0D4w1wbmW2\">a single melodic line</a> sung in unison and without instrumental accompaniment. Many of their melodies, Shakers said, were given to them by spirits. Some of these <a href=\"https://www.umasspress.com/9781558496392/millennial-praises/\">charmed and haunting strains</a> have permeated through broader American musical culture.</p>\n\n<h2>New form of family</h2>\n\n<p>The Shakers first began to organize in Manchester, England, in 1747. By 1770, they came to believe that the spirit of Christ had returned through their leader, “Mother” Ann Lee. However, “Mother Ann was not Christ, nor did she claim to be,” <a href=\"https://maineshakers.com/about/\">the Shakers state</a>. “She was simply the first of many Believers wholly embued by His spirit, wholly consumed by His love.”</p>\n\n<p>In 1774, Lee led eight followers to North America, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/watervliet-shaker-historic-district.htm\">settling near what is now Albany, New York</a>. As is still true today, Shakers held their property in common, following the model of the earliest Christians that is recorded in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A32-35&amp;version=KJV\">the Bible’s Book of Acts</a>.

Lee taught that humanity could not follow Christ in the work of spiritual regeneration, or salvation, “while living in the works of natural generation, and wallowing in their lusts.” For Shakers, celibacy is one way people can reunite their spirits with God, who they believe is <a href=\"https://maineshakers.com/about/\">dually male and female</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every Shaker, therefore, joined the faith as a convert, or the child of converts. Families who joined their communities were effectively dissolved: Husbands and wives became brothers and sisters; parents and children the same. <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=evans;idno=N15134.0001.001\">Early accounts</a> report that, in extreme instances, children publicly denounced their parents and pummeled their genitals in an effort to subdue the flesh and its earthly ties. </p>\n\n<h2>Shaking with the spirit</h2>\n\n<p>The Shakers of Lee’s day – now seen as American as apple pie – were regarded as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-09262-5\">a fundamental threat to society</a>. In part, that stemmed from their perceived dissolution of families. But many outsiders were also alarmed by their ritual dances, whose intensity and emotion demonstrated a physicality seemingly incongruous with their celibacy.</p>\n\n<p>In the early years, Shaker worship was an unbridled individual expression of spiritual enthusiasm. Eventually, it transformed into highly choreographed dances. At first, these were agonizingly slow and laborious series of movements designed to mortify the flesh – to help the spiritual overcome the physical – and instill discipline and union among the members.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lhc9PK2tG5k?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Historians and reenactors have recreated some Shaker dances.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>What kind of music accompanied such striking movements? The earliest Shaker songs, including ones attributed to Lee, <a href=\"https://commonplace.online/article/lets-mingle-feelings/\">have no intelligible language</a>. Rather, they were sung using vocalized syllables or “vocables,” such as lo-de-lo or la-la-la or vi-vo-vum. Shakers invented a new form of notation to record their songs, using letters adorned with a variety of hashmarks to denote pitch and rhythm. </p>\n\n<p>Early observers of the Shakers noted the effects of <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=evans;idno=N13709.0001.001\">their unique musical practice</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>They begin by sitting down and shaking their heads in a violent manner, … one will begin to sing some odd tune, without words or rule; after a while another will strike in; …  after a while they all fall in and make a strange charm … The mother, so called, minds to strike such notes as makes a concord, and so form the charm.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shakers were meticulous recordkeepers regarding every aspect of community life. <a href=\"https://commonplace.online/article/lets-mingle-feelings/\">Music was no exception</a>. More than 1,000 volumes of Shaker music survive in manuscript: tens of thousands of songs dating from Lee’s day to the mid-20th century.</p>\n\n<p>Scholars, musicians and researchers have extracted treasures from this repertoire. Most notably, composer Aaron Copland adapted Elder Joseph Brackett’s famous 1848 tune “Simple Gifts” for “Appalachian Spring”: the ballet that <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/aaron-copland\">won Copland a Pulitzer in 1945</a>. Hidden gems must still abound in the remaining unplumbed depths of Shaker manuscript songbooks. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the Shakers left few detailed instructions for their dance. But eyewitness accounts abound, and scholars have made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhc9PK2tG5k\">careful and respectful reconstructions</a>.  </p>\n\n<h2>Living faith</h2>\n\n<p>Fastvold’s film evokes the chaotic, violent world of the first Shakers in America, who converted farm families along the New York-Massachusetts border during the Revolutionary War. Some outsiders regarded the sect as an English plot to <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=evans;idno=N13972.0001.001\">neutralize the populace with religious fervor</a>, opening the way for a British reconquest of New England. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A balding man in a red sweatshirt bends down to nuzzle a white sheep.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=688&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=688&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709834/original/file-20251219-56-umf5q1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=688&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Brother Arnold, one of the three Shakers now living at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, scratches a ram after shearing in 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brother-arnold-scratches-two-spot-a-4-year-old-ram-after-it-news-photo/2154520896?adppopup=true\">Gregory Rec/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The director’s vision, incarnated by Seyfried’s bewitching presence and voice, invokes the uncanny atmosphere of early Shakerism.

Every December, political leaders reach instinctively for the <a href=\"https://x.com/POTUS46Archive/status/1871933921631330810\">language of goodwill</a>. Meanwhile, diplomats the world over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd5f0537-e89d-4e8e-a645-3e791e359d29\">use the season</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/11/religion.topstories3\">host parties</a> at which gift-giving and booze are used to help foster friendships.</p>\n\n<p>The notion that the holiday season might bring a respite from conflict has deep roots in history. Medieval “<a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/3-12236317\">Christmas peace” laws</a> in northern Europe at one point punished crimes committed during the season with harsher penalties, enshrining in law a cultural sense of expectation for quiet and restraint. </p>\n\n<p>Finland still <a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/74-20010296\">reads the Declaration of Christmas Peace</a> each Christmas Eve – a ceremonial reminder of an older hope that violence might briefly ebb.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s “<a href=\"https://mainstreamweekly.net/article10407.html\">Christmas diplomacy</a>” – that is, a range of statements and efforts to encourage peace and warm relations between nations — updates the tradition for statecraft. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, such diplomacy really does open a window for talks. Sometimes it is a cultural reflex. Sometimes it is pure theater. And sometimes, the season’s distractions are exploited for war and violence rather than peace.</p>\n\n<h2>The most famous of them all</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/artifact/signing-treaty-ghent-christmas-eve-1814-oil-canvas-sir-amedee-forestier-1914-0\">Treaty of Ghent</a> that ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain was signed on Christmas Eve. It was a signal that both sides were ready to convert seasonal sentiment into durable peace.</p>\n\n<p>But the most famous example of the season interrupting conflict is <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-real-story-of-the-christmas-truce\">the Christmas Truce of 1914</a>. After months of fighting along parts of the Western Front in World War I, soldiers on opposing sides left the trenches to sing, retrieve the dead and share a moment of humanity before returning to the industrial warfare from which many of them would never return. </p>\n\n<p>This act was repeated during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, when a small number of American and German soldiers struck a <a href=\"https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/christmas-truce-1944.html\">temporary truce</a> in the Hürtgen Forest during Christmas 1944. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"People standing around drinking out of cocktail glasses.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709806/original/file-20251218-56-2670er.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Guests enjoy martinis and shots of vodka during a party at the Russian Embassy in Washington in 2007.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/guests-enjoy-martinis-and-shots-of-vodka-during-a-party-at-news-photo/73858965?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Getty Images for Russian Standard</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A seasonal opening to dialogue?</h2>\n\n<p>More recently, governments and nongovernmental actors have leveraged the holidays to open the door for future peace negotiations. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/events/truce/chron.htm\">Northern Ireland</a>, for example, the Provisional IRA repeatedly declared Christmas ceasefires, most notably in December 1974 when it announced a halt to operations from Dec. 22 through early January. While the truce ultimately collapsed, it reflected a recurring pattern during <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-troubles\">The Troubles</a> in which Christmas provided a culturally resonant moment to signal openness to dialogue. </p>\n\n<p>A similar logic was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-eln-leftist-guerrilla-group-declares-christmas-ceasefire-2022-12-19/\">observed more recently in Colombia</a>, where in 2022, the National Liberation Army (ELN) declared a unilateral Christmas ceasefire, explicitly tying the pause in hostilities to ongoing peace negotiations with the government. </p>\n\n<p>In both cases, Christmas functioned not as a sentimental interruption to war, but as a strategic moment to legitimize restraint and probe whether diplomacy could bring an end to the underlying conflict.</p>\n\n<p>But as with any temporary ceasefire, Christmas truces can be prone to violations. During the Vietnam War, warring parties in 1971 agreed to a 24-hour Christmas truce. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/26/archives/christmas-truce-ends-in-vietnam-both-sides-charge-violation-no-us.html\">report from The New York Times</a> the following day included allegations of 19 violations by the Vietcong and 170 by American and South Vietnamese forces.</p>\n\n<p>The holidays can also serve as an opportunity to catch an enemy off guard.</p>\n\n<p>Seven years before the short-lived 1971 Christmas truce, Vietcong fighters <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/the-annals-of-christmas-diplomacy/250176/\">chose Christmas Eve to launch an attack</a> on a hotel where U.S. officers were celebrating. Two Americans were killed and 28 were injured.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/december-24/soviet-tanks-roll-into-afghanistan\">Soviet Union</a> launched its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan on Christmas Eve, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/economy/israeli-air-force-attacks-gaza-city-witness-idUSLR13423/\">Israel’s 2008 Gaza operation</a> began on Dec. 27. The logic here is that in late December, political bandwidth in national capitals is thin, diplomatic machinery moves more slowly and the opportunity for surprise is greater.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Tis the season for …</h2>\n\n<p>Christmas diplomacy can therefore be used to encourage peace – or war.</p>\n\n<p>It can also be used to deepen existing bilateral friendships.</p>\n\n<p>A well-known example is Norway’s <a href=\"https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Trafalgar-Square-Christmas-Tree/\">annual donation of Christmas trees</a> to the United Kingdom. The practice began in 1947, when Oslo sent a giant spruce to London’s Trafalgar Square as a thank-you for British support during World War II. It has since become a ritualized expression of common history, shared sacrifice and enduring alliance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man and women cut a red ribbon in front of a large tree.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709804/original/file-20251218-56-oa1fse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Then foreign secretaries Ine Eriksen Soreide of Norway and Boris Johnson of the U.K. unveil the 2017 Christmas tree gifted by Norway.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/norways-foreign-secretary-ine-eriksen-soreide-stands-news-photo/885267530?adppopup=true\">Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>And embassies around the world host <a href=\"https://embassymagazine.com/12-diplomatic-days-of-christmas/\">Christmas receptions</a> that function as informal diplomatic spaces – occasions where tensions ease, conversations flow more freely and difficult issues can be broached in a more relaxed setting. </p>\n\n<p>These practices do not resolve crises but lay important groundwork for goodwill and access.</p>\n\n<p>Christmas diplomacy endures because it stands at the crossroads of culture, power and politics.

On a special part of its website that the department titled “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein\">Epstein Library</a>,” it lists documents such as court records and records released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests to the government. </p>\n\n<p>Their release was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text\">ordered by Congress in bipartisan legislation</a> passed in November 2025. The deadline imposed by Congress was Dec. 19, 2025, and the Department of Justice met it with the partial release of documents in its possession with eight hours to spare.</p>\n\n<p>Those files will be read, dissected and discussed by politicians and the public and reported on by the news media. It will be the latest eruption in a story that has slipped in and out of the headlines for years, but in a very particular way.

Those segments are a reminder that another story is available, one that treats the women at the center of the case as sources of understanding, not just as evidence of someone else’s fall from grace.</p>\n\n<p>These coexisting storylines reveal a deeper problem. After the #MeToo movement peaked, the public conversation about sexual violence and the news <a href=\"https://opportunityagenda.org/messaging_reports/shifting-the-narrative/case-4/\">has clearly shifted</a>. More survivors now speak publicly under their own names, and some outlets have adapted. </p>\n\n<p>Yet long-standing conventions about <a href=\"https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/components_of_newsworthiness.html\">what counts as news</a> – conflict, scandal, elite people and dramatic turns in a case – still shape which aspects of sexual violence make it into headlines and which stay on the margins.</p>\n\n<p>That tension raises a question: In a case where the law largely permits naming victims of sexual violence, and where some survivors are explicitly asking to be seen, why do journalistic practices so often withhold names or treat victims as secondary to the story?</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-qiZT9dOFs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=11\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A “CBS Evening News” story from Dec. 12, 2025, teases the photos revealed by House Democrats of famous men with Jeffrey Epstein.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What the law allows – and why newsrooms rarely do it</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that government generally may not punish news organizations <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/469/\">for publishing truthful information</a> drawn from public records, even when that information is a rape victim’s name. </p>\n\n<p>When states tried in the 1970s and 1980s to penalize outlets that identified victims using names that had already appeared in court documents or police reports, the court said <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/florida-star-v-b-j-f/\">those punishments violated the First Amendment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Newsrooms responded by tightening restraint, not loosening it. Under pressure from feminist activists, victim advocates and their own staff, many organizations <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-006-9069-9\">adopted policies against identifying victims of sexual assault</a>, especially without consent. </p>\n\n<p>Journalism <a href=\"https://www.spj.org/spj-code-of-ethics/\">ethics codes now urge reporters to “minimize harm</a>,” be cautious about naming victims of sex crimes, and consider the risk of retraumatization and stigma. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, U.S. law permits what newsroom ethics codes discourage.</p>\n\n<h2>How anonymity became the norm and #MeToo complicated it</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Anti-rape culture protesters gathered in a crowd.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The anti-rape movement in the U.S. forced newsrooms to revisit assumptions about whose voices should lead a story.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/hundreds-of-anti-rape-culture-protesters-gathered-in-thomas-news-photo/1043362588?adppopup=true\">Cory Clark/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For much of the 20th century, rape victims were routinely named in U.S. news coverage – a reflection of unequal gender norms. Victims’ reputations were treated as public property, while men accused of sexual violence were portrayed sympathetically and in detail.</p>\n\n<p>By the 1970s and 1980s, feminist movements drew attention to <a href=\"https://www.endsexualassault.org/history-of-the-sexual-assault-movement/\">underreporting and intense stigma</a>. Activists built rape crisis centers and hotlines, documented how rarely sexual assault cases led to prosecution, and argued that if a woman feared seeing her name in the paper, she might never report at all. </p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers passed “<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/rape-shield-law\">rape shield laws</a>” that limited the use of a victim’s sexual history in court. Some states went further by barring publication of victims’ names. </p>\n\n<p>In response to these laws, as well as feminist pressure, most newsrooms by the 1980s moved toward a <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2018/to-tell-the-stories-of-sexual-assault-victims-its-time-for-a-new-look-at-anonymity-policies/\">default rule of not naming victims</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, the #MeToo movement added a turn. Survivors in workplaces, politics and entertainment chose to speak publicly, often under their own names, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html\">about serial abuse and institutional cover-ups</a>. Their accounts forced newsrooms to revisit assumptions about whose voices should lead a story. </p>\n\n<p>Yet #MeToo also unfolded within existing journalistic conventions. Investigations tended to focus on <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2020/01/27/metoo-makes-difference-sex-crime-reporting-study-shows\">high-profile men</a>, spectacular falls from power and moments of reckoning, leaving less space for the quieter, ongoing realities of recovery, legal limbo and community response.</p>\n\n<h2>The unintended effects of keeping survivors faceless</h2>\n\n<p>There are good reasons for policies against naming victims. </p>\n\n<p>Survivors may face harassment, employment discrimination or danger from abusers if they are identified. <a href=\"https://media.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/files/media/documents/itu-unicef-guidelines-child-online-protection.pdf\">For minors</a>, there are additional concerns about long-term digital evidence. In communities where sexual violence carries intense social stigma, anonymity can be a lifeline.</p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=ucin1592171139720739&amp;disposition=inline\">research on media framing</a> suggests that naming patterns matter. When coverage focuses on the alleged perpetrator as a complex individual – someone with a name, a career and a backstory – while referring to “a victim” or “accusers” in the singular, audiences are more likely to empathize with the suspect and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0075\">scrutinize the victim’s behavior</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In high-profile cases like Epstein’s, that dynamic intensifies. The powerful men connected to him are named, dissected and speculated about. The survivors, unless they work hard to step forward, remain a blurred mass in the background. Anonymity meant to protect actually flattens their experience. Different stories of grooming, coercion and survival get reduced to a single faceless category.</p>\n\n<h2>A window into what we think is ‘news’</h2>\n\n<p>That flattening is part of what makes the current moment in the Epstein story so revealing. The suspense is less about whether more victims will be heard and more about what being named will do to influential men. It becomes a story about whose names count as news.</p>\n\n<p>Carefully anonymizing survivors while breathlessly chasing a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-pam-bondi-03fbcd024f631440f7ed62b3c6927db3\">client list</a> of powerful men unintentionally sends a message about who matters most. </p>\n\n<p>The Epstein scandal, in that framing, is not primarily about what was done to girls and young women over many years, but about who among the elite might be embarrassed, implicated or exposed.</p>\n\n<p>A more survivor-centered journalistic approach would start from a different set of questions, including wondering which survivors have chosen to speak on the record and why, and how news outlets can protect anonymity, when it is asked for, but still convey a victim’s individuality.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are not only about ethics. They are about news judgment. They ask editors and reporters to <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-powerful-and-privileged-how-misrepresentation-and-underrepresentation-disadvantaged\">consider whether the most important part of a story</a> like Epstein’s is the next famous name to drop or the ongoing lives of the people whose abuse made that name newsworthy at all.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is an update to a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/epsteins-victims-deserve-more-attention-than-his-client-list-270244\">story originally published</a> on Dec. 15, 2025, to reflect the release of documents by the U.S. Department of Justice on Dec. 19.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272414/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephanie A.

So it was a problem when my baby brother was born a day before my birthday. For years, I would beg my parents for a birthday gift “one day early.” My laid-back brother remembers thinking, “I don’t care about presents. Just give her mine!”</p>\n\n<p>As an associate professor and <a href=\"https://liberalarts.du.edu/about/people/angela-j-narayan\">child psychologist</a> at the University of Denver who studies child development and parenting, I’ve come to learn about these types of challenges associated with gift giving. The holidays, while a magical time, can also be stressful. Society places an expectation on parents to buy gifts, regardless of their financial circumstances, and children themselves often feel a variety of complex emotions. </p>\n\n<p>How children react to getting presents is partially linked to temperament, which is the variety of ways that children experience, perceive and interact with the world. Temperament is the precursor to personality – some people are introverts, while others are extroverts. Temperament is partially heritable. That means an introverted parent who feels social pressure to buy many gifts for their shy and easily overwhelmed child may be inadvertently causing stress.</p>\n\n<p>Faced with this holiday conundrum, I’m often asked questions like “Is there a magic number of gifts to give my kids?” or “What gifts will hold my child’s attention the longest?” </p>\n\n<p>While there isn’t an easy answer to either question, these tips and tricks can help parents be more thoughtful and intentional about gift giving, especially for children who are young. </p>\n\n<h2>The age rule</h2>\n\n<p>Young children cannot focus on a lot of things at once. A good rule of thumb is that a 1-year-old can focus only on one thing at a time. A 2-year-old can maybe focus on two things at most, and a 3-year-old maybe three things, and so on. Stop at five. Very few children actually need more than five gifts, so feel free to go lower.</p>\n\n<h2>The attention rule</h2>\n\n<p>I have often searched for the magical gift that will keep my children occupied for hours, and so far I haven’t found it. What I have found is that my children – ages 5 and 7 – get excited about the things that I get excited about. So I try to buy things that I think are fun. Ask yourself what you would like to play with if you got to be a child again. I bet your children would be eager to join you in those things.</p>\n\n<h2>The games rule</h2>\n\n<p>Card and board games are great gifts, often inexpensive, fun for many ages – excepting babies, of course – and capable of holding attention for a long time. Plus, they usually don’t take up much storage space. I love giving my kids games that are not only fun but also teach them helpful skills. </p>\n\n<p>Collaborative games for preschoolers and early school-age children like the Fairy Game and Outfoxed teach problem-solving, teamwork and early reasoning skills. Games for elementary-age children, such as Sorry and Battleship, teach kids how to manage difficult situations, like not always being in the lead, being a good sport even if you’re behind, and losing gracefully.</p>\n\n<p>Timeless card games like Uno and Memory, and newer ones like Sleeping Queens and Exploding Kittens, are great for using working memory, thinking flexibly, persisting and strategizing. Most importantly, playing games together supports positive family time, which is an excellent antidote to stress, bad moods or boredom. </p>\n\n<h2>The pressure rule</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine the holiday experience through the eyes of each of your children. Some children relish receiving gifts, like I did. Others, however, may feel self-conscious, overwhelmed by the sensory overload – all the textures, commotion and bright colors, not to mention people staring at them. The elements of surprise combined with the unspoken social pressure to be gracious and well regulated are challenging for any young child.</p>\n\n<p>We expect small children to contain their excitement, delay gratification and react positively to the surprise. And then come up with a polite response. These are all complex requests, rarely directly or explicitly taught. It’s no wonder that many children show negative emotions, have tantrums, or even just say, “I’m tired!” during holiday celebrations. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why beyond the precise nature of “the perfect gift,” we shouldn’t lose sight of what we should be doing. And that is investing in togetherness and helping kids learn skills like being patient and taking turns, strengthening memory capacities, planning ahead, not giving up, and that being a team player will pay off later. These skills pave the way for longer sustained attention, focus and concentration, as well as confidence. </p>\n\n<p>My 7-year-old is becoming a skillful chess player because we have taught him the rules and strategy and helped him practice. Maybe this is the real magical gift – not the purchase itself, but the decision to invest in time with your child early.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272201/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Angela J.

The invisible polio virus would strike, leaving young children on crutches, in wheelchairs or in a dreaded “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0hjmczc/what-is-the-iron-lung-and-how-does-it-work-\">iron lung</a>” ventilator. Each summer, the fear was so great that <a href=\"http://www.iowapbs.org/shows/explores/digital-short/3653/polio-epidemic\">public pools and movie theaters closed</a>. Parents <a href=\"https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/life/2016/06/02/polio/85298458\">canceled birthday parties</a>, afraid their child might be the next victim. A U.S. president paralyzed by polio called for Americans to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-mailed-dimes-truck-load-fdrs-white-house-cure-polio-180961594/\">send dimes to the White House</a> to support the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-3/franklin-roosevelt-founds-march-of-dimes\">National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</a>, established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his lawyer, Basil O’Connor. Celebrities from Lucille Ball to Elvis were enlisted to promote this “March of Dimes,” and mothers went door to door raising funds to conquer this dreaded disease.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those funds went to 33-year-old scientist Jonas Salk and his team at the University of Pittsburgh, where they worked in a lab between a morgue and a darkroom to develop the world’s first successful polio vaccine. </p>\n\n<p>To prove it worked, the experimental vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/about/history-mission/jonas-salk-legacy-pitt/general-history\">tested on Pittsburgh schoolchildren</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/about/history-mission/jonas-salk-legacy-pitt/general-history\">1.8 million children</a> from around the country as part of the largest medical field trial in history. On April 12, 1955, when the Salk polio vaccine was declared “<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination\">safe and effective</a>,” church bells rang out, kids were let out of school, and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/press-made-polio-vaccine-trials-public-spectacle-180977304/\">headlines around the world</a> celebrated the victory over polio.</p>\n\n<p>When asked whether he was going to patent the vaccine, Salk told journalist Edward R. Murrow it belonged to the people and would be like “<a href=\"https://retroreport.org/transcript/transcript-could-you-patent-the-sun/\">patenting the sun</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>I first learned about this 20 years ago when my students and I filmed the 50th anniversary celebration of the Salk polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh. I had just started teaching after working in Los Angeles as a screenwriter and TV producer, and the footage became “<a href=\"https://carlkurlander.com/video/theshotfeltroundtheworld/\">The Shot Felt Round the World</a>,” a documentary that featured those we met that day. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black and white photo of nurse in white leaning over row of seated elementary school-aged children with sleeves rolled up\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709543/original/file-20251217-56-outn0i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A nurse prepares children for a polio vaccine shot in February 1954 as part of a citywide testing of the vaccine on Pittsburgh elementary school students.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nurse-prepares-children-for-a-polia-vaccine-shot-as-part-of-news-photo/515220140\">Bettmann/Bettmann Collection via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The ‘Pittsburgh polio pioneers’</h2>\n\n<p>Among the people we interviewed was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-deadly-polio-epidemic-and-why-it-matters-for-coronavirus-133976\">Ethyl “Mickey” Bailey</a>, who worked in the lab pipetting the deadly polio virus <a href=\"https://www.brandtech.com/about-us/news-and-events/pipette-technology-over-the-years#:%7E:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20mouth,well%20as%20contamination%20of%20samples.\">by mouth</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.upmc.com/media/news/youngner-obit\">Julius Youngner</a>, the lab’s senior scientist who had worked on the Manhattan Project before coming to Pittsburgh.

As a result, the <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/\">Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> was built in 1963 on the coastline in La Jolla, California, where it <a href=\"https://prcclinical.com/san-diego-taking-the-pulse-of-the-biotech-industry\">fueled San Diego’s biotech industry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Near the end of his life, Salk would say sometimes he would run into people who didn’t know what polio was, and he found that gratifying. But today the world is paying a high price for those who don’t remember what life was like before these events and now <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccine-hesitancy-how-social-and-technological-issues-converged-to-spawn-mistrust-261938\">question the value of vaccines</a>. The polio virus may not be visible, but it is still with us. </p>\n\n<h2>The final mile to eradication</h2>\n\n<p>On Oct. 24, 2025, as the Salk vaccine turned 70, I was invited to screen the trailer for “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp9V2p40kKw\">The Shot Felt Round the World</a>” at a World Polio Day event on Roosevelt Island in New York City, in a building next to the ruins of the Smallpox Hospital – a legacy of the only human disease ever eradicated. </p>\n\n<p>Those present included the executive director of UNICEF, the polio director from the Gates Foundation, the U.N. representative for Rotary International and government officials from around the world who spoke about the global coalition dedicated to eradicating this disease. Since the 1980s, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has put tremendous resources into taking polio from being endemic in 125 countries to now just in two: <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1\">Pakistan and Afghanistan</a>. This group, whom I like to call “The Avengers of Public Health,” continue to work relentlessly to make the world polio-free.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Woman in traditional Afghan dress tries to squeeze medical drops into mouth of a baby held in another woman's arms\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709547/original/file-20251217-56-8rgpgt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An Afghan health worker administers polio vaccine to a child in Kabul in 2010.

To ensure that future generations know this story, perhaps now is the time to launch a “March of Dimes” marketing technique to engage young people from around the world to help finish the job that began in the Salk lab in Pittsburgh. </p>\n\n<p>One polio survivor who is still alive is “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/\">The Godfather</a>” director Francis Ford Coppola, who has spoken about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/entertainment/francis-ford-coppola-polio-survivor\">contracting polio as a child</a>. Imagine him being interviewed by his granddaughter <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@r0mymars?lang=en\">Romy Mars</a>, a TikTok influencer, and his daughter <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001068/\">Sophia Coppola</a>, the film director and actress. They could make a video that features cameos from actor and comedian Bill Murray, who <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477855/\">played Franklin D. Roosevelt in a movie</a> and whose sister had polio; and U.S. Sen.

For such a cruel disease, polio has a strange way of bringing us together. </p>\n\n<p>I pray that when we finally wipe polio off the planet, a feat the Global Polio Eradication Initiative <a href=\"https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Shaping-the-path-to-a-polio-free-world-and-beyond-20251215.pdf\">targets for 2029</a>, the whole world will celebrate and realize the power of pulling together to defeat a common enemy. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270042/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carl Kurlander has previously received grants from the Grable Foundation, the Pittsburgh Foundation, and the R.K.

Critics warned that dropping expert oversight could erode trust and reliability in the digital information landscape, especially when profit-driven platforms are mostly left to police themselves. </p>\n\n<p>What much of this debate has overlooked, however, is that today, AI large language models are <a href=\"https://today.umd.edu/report-ai-use-in-newspapers-is-widespread-uneven-and-rarely-disclosed\">increasingly used</a> to write up news summaries, headlines and content that catch your attention long before traditional content moderation mechanisms can step in. The issue isn’t clear-cut cases of misinformation or harmful subject matter going unflagged in the absence of content moderation. What’s missing from the discussion is how ostensibly accurate information is selected, framed and emphasized in ways that can shape public perception.</p>\n\n<p>Large language models gradually influence the way people form opinions by generating the information that chatbots and virtual assistants present to people over time. These models are now also being built into news sites, social media platforms and search services, making them the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/\">primary gateway to obtain information</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Studies show that large language models do <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1609/aies.v8i1.36552\">more than simply pass along information</a>. Their responses can subtly highlight certain viewpoints while minimizing others, often without users realizing it.</p>\n\n<h2>Communication bias</h2>\n\n<p>My colleague, computer scientist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=o3Mh4FwAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Stefan Schmid</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&amp;user=4Z8ZSLQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">and I</a>, a technology law and policy scholar, show in a forthcoming accepted paper in the journal Communications of the ACM that large language models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.21075\">exhibit communication bias</a>. We found that they may have a tendency to highlight particular perspectives while omitting or diminishing others. Such bias can influence how users think or feel, regardless of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190698577.001.0001\">whether the information presented is true or false</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Empirical research over the past few years has produced <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1609/aies.v8i1.36552\">benchmark datasets</a> that correlate model outputs with party positions before and during elections. They reveal variations in how current large language models deal with public content. Depending on the persona or context used in prompting large language models, current models subtly tilt toward particular positions – even when factual accuracy remains intact. </p>\n\n<p>These shifts point to an emerging form of persona-based steerability – a model’s tendency to align its tone and emphasis with the perceived expectations of the user. For instance, when a user describes themselves as an environmental activist and another as a business owner, a model may answer the same question about a new climate law by emphasizing different, yet factually accurate, concerns for each of them. For example, the criticisms could be that the law does not go far enough in promoting environmental benefits and that the law imposes regulatory burdens and compliance costs.</p>\n\n<p>Such alignment can easily be misread as flattery. The phenomenon is called <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=v5Akllkc8i\">sycophancy</a>: Models effectively tell users what they want to hear. But while sycophancy is a symptom of user-model interaction, communication bias runs deeper. It reflects disparities in who designs and builds these systems, what datasets they draw from and which incentives drive their refinement. When a handful of developers dominate the large language model market and their systems consistently present some viewpoints more favorably than others, small differences in model behavior can scale into significant distortions in public communication.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3FdAlBYJFg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Bias in large language models starts with the data they’re trained on.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What regulation can and can’t do</h2>\n\n<p>Modern society increasingly relies on large language models as the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-chatgpt-effect-in-3-years-the-ai-chatbot-has-changed-the-way-people-look-things-up-270143\">primary interface between people and information</a>. Governments worldwide have launched policies to address concerns over AI bias. For instance, the European Union’s <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj/eng\">AI Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj/eng\">Digital Services Act</a> attempt to impose transparency and accountability. But neither is designed to address the nuanced issue of communication bias in AI outputs. </p>\n\n<p>Proponents of AI regulation often cite neutral AI as a goal, but true neutrality is often unattainable. AI systems reflect the biases embedded in their data, training and design, and attempts to regulate such bias often end up <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=H72JEXAPwo\">trading one flavor of bias for another</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And communication bias is not just about accuracy – it is about content generation and framing. Imagine asking an AI system a question about a contentious piece of legislation. The model’s answer is not only shaped by facts, but also by how those facts are presented, which sources are highlighted and the tone and viewpoint it adopts.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the root of the bias problem is not merely in addressing biased training data or skewed outputs, but in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jaenfo/jnac035\">market structures that shape technology design</a> in the first place. When only a few large language models have access to information, the risk of communication bias grows. Apart from regulation, then, effective bias mitigation requires safeguarding competition, user-driven accountability and regulatory openness to different ways of building and offering large language models.</p>\n\n<p>Most regulations so far aim at banning harmful outputs after the technology’s deployment, or forcing companies to run audits before launch. Our analysis shows that while prelaunch checks and post-deployment oversight may catch the most glaring errors, they may be less effective at addressing subtle communication bias that emerges through user interactions.</p>\n\n<h2>Beyond AI regulation</h2>\n\n<p>It is tempting to expect that regulation can eliminate all biases in AI systems. In some instances, these policies can be helpful, but they tend to fail to address a deeper issue: the incentives that determine the technologies that communicate information to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings clarify that a more lasting solution lies in fostering competition, transparency and meaningful user participation, enabling consumers to play an active role in how companies design, test and deploy large language models. </p>\n\n<p>The reason these policies are important is that, ultimately, AI will not only influence the information we seek and the daily news we read, but it will also play a crucial part in shaping the kind of society we envision for the future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269354/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adrian Kuenzler does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But the reality of the 1,000-year period from 500 to 1500 was much more complex. This is especially true when considering the peasants, <a href=\"https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/%7Ehwloidl/hundredyearswar.com/Books/History/Commoner.htm\">who made up about 90% of the population</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For all their hard work, peasants had a fair amount of downtime. Add up Sundays and the many holidays, and about one-third of the year was free of intensive work. Celebrations were frequent and centered around religious holidays like Easter, Pentecost and saints’ days.</p>\n\n<p>But the longest and most festive of these holidays was Christmas.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://udayton.edu/directory/artssciences/history/sutherland_bobbi.php\">As a professor of medieval history</a>, I can assure you the popular belief that the lives of peasants were little more than misery is a misconception. They enjoyed rich social lives – maybe richer than ours – ate well, celebrated frequently and had families not unlike our own. For them,  holiday festivities didn’t begin with Christmas Eve and end with New Year’s.</p>\n\n<p>The party was just getting started.</p>\n\n<h2>Daily life in a peasant village</h2>\n\n<p>A peasant was not simply a low-class or poor person. Rather, a peasant was a subsistence farmer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/serfdom\">who owed their lords a portion of the food they grew</a>. They also provided labor, which might include bridge-building or farming the lord’s land.</p>\n\n<p>In return, a lord provided his peasants with protection from bandits or invaders. They also provided justice via a court system and punished people for theft, murder and other crimes. Typically, the lord lived in the village or nearby.</p>\n\n<p>Peasants lived in the countryside, <a href=\"https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/daily-medieval-life/\">in villages</a> that ranged from a few houses to several hundred. The villages had communal ovens, wells, flour mills, brewers or pubs, and blacksmiths. The houses were clustered in the center of the village along a dirt street and surrounded by farmland.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A photo of a primitive stone house with a thatched roof.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/640321/original/file-20241230-17-7louo3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 14th-century thatched cottage in what is now West Sussex, England.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/14th-century-thatched-cottage-in-a-woodland-setting-royalty-free-image/148826994?phrase=middle%20ages&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">David C.

Houses might be made of turf, wood, stone or “<a href=\"https://www.roanokeisland.com/blog/2020/02/13/building-settlement-wattle-and-daub-method\">waddle-and-daub</a>,” a construction very similar to lathe and plaster, with beamed roofs covered in straw. Houses had front doors, and some had back doors. Windows were covered with shutters and, rarely, glass. Aside from the fireplace, only the Sun, Moon or an oil lamp or candle provided light.</p>\n\n<h2>Strange sleep habits and sex without privacy</h2>\n\n<p>The day was dictated by seasons and sunlight. Most people rose at dawn or a bit before; men went out to their fields soon after to grow grains like wheat and barley. Women worked in the home and yard, taking care of children, animals and vegetable gardens, along with the spinning, sewing and cooking. Peasants didn’t have clocks, so a recipe might recommend cooking something for the time it took <a href=\"https://the-history-girls.blogspot.com/2017/08/cooking-on-prayer-by-karen-maitland.html\">to say the Lord’s Prayer three times</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Around midday, people usually took a break <a href=\"https://historylearning.com/medieval-england/food-drink-in-medieval-england/\">and ate their largest meal</a> – often a soup or stew. The foods they ate could include lamb and beef, <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/may/medieval-peasant-diet.html\">along with cheese</a>, cabbage, onions, leeks, turnips and fava beans. Fish, in particular freshwater fish, were also popular.

By our standards, <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/medieval-europe-beer-clean-water\">peasants drank a lot</a>, although the alcohol content of the beer and wine was lower than today’s versions. They often napped before returning to work. In the evening, they ate a light meal, perhaps only bread, and socialized for a while.</p>\n\n<p>They went to bed within a few hours of darkness, so how long they slept depended on the season. On average, they slept about eight hours, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16964783\">but not consecutively</a>. They awoke after a “first sleep” and prayed, had sex or chatted with neighbors for somewhere between half an hour and two hours, then returned to sleep for another four hours or so. </p>\n\n<p>Peasants did not have privacy as we think of it; everyone often slept in one big room. Parents made love with one another as their children slept nearby. Married couples shared a bed, and one of their younger children might sleep with them, though infants had cradles.

But the stretches of time for rest and leisure were enviable.</p>\n\n<p>Today, many people start thinking about Christmas after Thanksgiving, and any sort of holiday spirit fizzles by early January.</p>\n\n<p>In the Middle Ages, this would have been unheard of.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/guides/advent/\">Advent</a> – the period of anticipation and fasting that precedes Christmas – began with <a href=\"https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Martinmas/\">the Feast of St. Martin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Back then, it took place 40 days before Christmas; today, it’s the fourth Sunday before it. During this period, Western Christians observed a fast; while less strict than the one for Lent, <a href=\"https://www.medievalists.net/2015/12/63132/\">it restricted meat and dairy products to certain days of the week</a>. These protocols not only symbolized absence and longing, but they also helped stretch out the food supply after the end of the harvest and before meats were fully cured. </p>\n\n<p>Christmas itself was known for feasting and drunkenness – and it lasted nearly six weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Dec. 25 was followed by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21796404/12-days-of-christmas-explained\">the 12 Days of Christmas</a>, ending with <a href=\"https://sacredheartfla.org/sunday-mornings/seasonal/feast-days-solemnities/the-solemnity-of-the-epiphany-three-kings-day/\">the Epiphany on Jan. 6</a>, which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Gifts, often in the form of food or money, were exchanged, though this was more commonly done on New Year’s Day. Game birds, ham, mince pies and spiced wines were popular fare, with spices thought to help warm the body. </p>\n\n<p>Though Christmas officially celebrates the birth of Jesus, <a href=\"https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/A-Medieval-Christmas/\">it was clearly associated with pre-Christian celebrations</a> that emphasized the winter solstice and the return of light and life. This meant that bonfires, yule logs and evergreen decorations were part of the festivities. According to tradition, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231219-greccio-the-italian-village-thats-home-to-the-worlds-first-nativity-scene\">St. Francis of Assisi created the first nativity scene in 1223</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Christmas ended slowly, with the first Monday after Epiphany being called “<a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/plough-monday/\">Plough Monday</a>” because it marked the return to agricultural work. The full end of the season came on Feb. 2 – <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Candlemas\">called Candlemas</a> – which coincides with the older pagan holiday of Imbolc. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67652442\">On this day</a>, candles were blessed for use in the coming year, and any decorations left up were thought to be at risk of becoming infested with goblins.</p>\n\n<p>Many people today gripe about the stresses of the holidays: buying presents, traveling, cooking, cleaning and bouncing from one obligation to the next. There’s a short window to get it all done: Christmas Day is the only day many workplaces are required to give off.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, I’ll be dreaming of a medieval Christmas.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241328/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bobbi Sutherland does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

During the same month, Cameroonian President Paul Biya, who has ruled the country since 1982, secured an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx45zln4qvo\">unprecedented eighth term in office</a>. It will allow him to serve until he turns 99.     </p>\n\n<p>In neither <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroon-opposition-rejects-biyas-win-alleges-fraud-amid-violent-protests-2025-10-28/\">case were elections deemed free</a> or <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/african-union-election-observers-say-tanzania-polls-did-not-comply-with-2025-11-05/\">fair</a>, and in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cameroon-election-tchiroma-arrests-protests-077e1dafb4fdfc3344bd2beb8621c3ca\">both cases protests</a> and severe <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5594858/tanzanian-opposition-decries-sham-elections-alleges-hundreds-of-deaths\">government crackdowns</a> followed.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, while the outcome was ultimately the survival of incumbent governments, these elections are quite telling about the changing fortunes of autocracy in Africa. </p>\n\n<p>In 2019, I wrote a book titled “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Autocrats-Compete-Parties-Elections/dp/1108474764\">How Autocrats Compete</a>” that used Tanzania and Cameroon as contrasting examples. The divergent origins of their respective autocracies sowed the seeds for the kinds of challenges that each country would eventually face. Both country’s governments, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/21/cameroon-government-bans-opposition-coalitions\">which observers</a> <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/cameroon\">widely see</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/18/tanzania-africa-governance-human-rights-tanzania-samia-suluhu-hassan-uganda-drc-rwanda-sudan\">as repressive</a> <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/tanzania\">and antidemocratic</a>, have lost key sources of underlying strength, making them more vulnerable than they have been in decades.</p>\n\n<h2>The roots of 2 autocracies</h2>\n\n<p>“How Autocrats Compete” showed how Tanzania and Cameroon used to reflect two different strains of autocracy: party-based and a personalist. </p>\n\n<p>For decades, Julius Nyerere was the driving force in Tanzanian politics. An immensely popular anti-colonial leader, Nyerere in 1965 created a single-party state governed by a robust and effective political party apparatus – first under the Tanganyika African National Union and later recast as Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man on a motorcycle looks over his shoulder as a large political billboard can be seen behind him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709744/original/file-20251218-66-wqr13x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Pedestrians walk past a billboard for Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, who recently won reelection in an increasingly autocratic country.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TanzaniaElection/f9ce4a77c4f645ea9d0bbe3fc2e12cd4/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The party attracted a wide swath of rural voters, had national functioning institutions and a widespread grassroots presence. Importantly, when Nyerere stepped down from power in 1985 – then a precedent in African politics – he established an internal primary system to select CCM’s future presidential candidates.  </p>\n\n<p>Cameroon’s autocracy emerged from much different terrain. After independence, political power was heavily centralized in the presidency. The main source of power was the president’s ability to use carrots and sticks to bring together a multiethnic coalition of elites into a transactional relationship. </p>\n\n<p>By 1972, all political parties had been absorbed by the ruling Cameroonian National Union, later known as the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement. </p>\n\n<p>The ruling party played a secondary role compared to the presidency, withering away and not even meeting for years. Under Cameroon’s first president, Ahamdou Ahidjo, power was oriented to the north of the country, while under Paul Biya it has been oriented to the south. </p>\n\n<p>These different foundations for autocracy translated into unique adaptations to multiparty elections. In Tanzania, the ruling CCM could rely on widespread turnout, and the candidate selection processes appeared to minimize elite discontent within the party. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"People demonstrates on the street with signs.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C53%2C1024%2C576&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709729/original/file-20251218-56-4icr4s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Supporters of the opposition presidential candidate protest on the streets of Garoua, Cameroon, on Oct. 26, 2025, during the country’s latest – and disputed – presidential election.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CameroonElectionProtests/05064c9d61014ab3bbdd7b45660d3a10/photo\">AP Photo/Welba Yamo Pascal</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Between 1995 and 2010, CCM and its presidential candidates could win determinative vote shares while minimizing costly repression and fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Elections were <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/787837\">still not free and fair</a>, but there were not systematically high rates of violence or coercion. In fact, at the time many considered <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16990\">Tanzania somewhat of a democracy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The same could not be said of Cameroon, where elections were initially much more challenging for the ruling party and President Biya.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, the ruling CPDM suffered a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26956719?seq=1\">barrage of defections</a> and Biya <a href=\"https://www.electionpassport.com/files/1992-NDI-Cameroon-Election-Report.pdf\">won only 40% of the 1992 election</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But, largely shielded from international scrutiny, he could deploy highly repressive tools that allowed him to build an image of invulnerability. Former opponents rejoined the CPDM, and the opposition wilted away to an enclave in majority Francophone Cameroon’s English-speaking regions. At the core remained Biya, with virtual control over all political and economic life.</p>\n\n<h2>The erosion of hegemony in Tanzania</h2>\n\n<p>When I wrote “How Autocrats Compete,” I argued that CCM’s core strengths in Tanzania would ultimately erode. As younger generations became removed from the mythology of Nyerere, CCM’s voting constituency would diminish.</p>\n\n<p>And indeed, according to <a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/tanzania-round-5-summary-results-2012/\">Afrobarometer</a>, the percentage of Tanzanians who felt close to CCM declined from 91% in 2001 to 69% in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>CCM’s advantages as a ruling party also incentivized opposition parties to emulate it. There is <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article-abstract/118/473/692/5250960\">extensive</a> <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/664175/pdf?casa_token=N9TaQ0znBWYAAAAA:rXokf2zKcHmgx60Hsk5rD_dqjAvUexu1ZYo4yKaYRk1CgLiMHPmvBrsk3w2T1WkBOn-LukR53Q\">research</a> on how the main Tanzanian opposition party Chadema mimicked CCM’s grassroots approach to party building.</p>\n\n<p>These changes were accompanied by increased factionalism within CCM. The key moment was the 2015 election when front-runner presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/the-lowassa-factor-and-how-it-influenced-the-2015-elections-3883412\">Edward Lowassa was disqualified</a> and John Magufuli nominated instead. Magufuli, seen as an institutional choice, had no strong ties to any specific faction, and thus a tenuous grasp over the party elite. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"People protest in the street as smoke from street fires billow above.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709731/original/file-20251218-76-bextiv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People protest a day after the general election following allegations of electoral irregularities in Tanzania on Oct. 30, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/PicturesoftheWeekGlobalPhotoGallery/e97ead0cdec945dda74e768e76993b26/photo\">AP Photo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The answer to all of these challenges has been for the ruling party to crack down on opposition and impose discipline. Since 2015, Tanzania has become a demonstrably less open place, ratcheting up the brutality <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54484609\">against opposition</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/tanzania-police-arrest-senior-opposition-leaders-ban-meeting-2024-08-12/\">elites</a> and civil society writ large. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, to control its own elite, CCM has had to <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/787836/summary?casa_token=IcdZ7zY4GuIAAAAA:8QpWYBtF-zYxDDdHDtdgmVj_UYd_AFtL_ddAhhqnFF1-tlIyFW3xrtKMMmzUuzTvzjt7r1dm-A\">restrict its ability to maneuver</a>. Despite promises of reform and conciliatory gestures, Hassan appears driven by the same political logic – the party cannot lose and can no longer rely on the tools of the past. The only way to secure victory is through much more overt repression.</p>\n\n<h2>The limits of personal rule in Cameroon</h2>\n\n<p>The personalized nature of the Cameroonian government has made the question of succession a perennial puzzle. </p>\n\n<p>Absent any credible mechanism for choosing a successor, Biya’s solution has been to kick the can down the road. In 2008, despite public discontent, he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/economy/cameroons-biya-signs-law-allowing-third-term-bid-idUSL15296024/\">controversially removed term limits</a>, seemingly signaling his willingness to stay in office indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p>But Biya’s ability to hold together the historic multiethnic coalition has appeared severely weakened in recent years. </p>\n\n<p>Cameroon’s English-speaking regions, representing nearly a quarter of the population, grew more vocal in their demands for equality in Cameroon’s heavily centralized political system. The government’s response has been violent, and since 2017 these regions have been mired in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6296pp1p6wo\">civil conflict</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Biya has also faced growing opposition from the the wing of his coalition representing the Bamileké, an important ethnic group that has largely remained within the ruling fold. Since 2012, when one of its leaders, Maurice Kamto, defected to challenge Biya, the government has routinely responded by arresting <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/30/cameroon-opposition-leaders-arrested\">the opposition figure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/09/cameroon-protesters-arbitrary-detention/\">many of his supporters</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An elderly man in a suit drops his vote into a bin during an election.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709740/original/file-20251218-66-aw43oh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cameroon President Paul Biya casts his ballot in Yaounde, Cameroon, on Oct. 12, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CameroonInauguration/7e58919550ea4cfca5c5ac13c20c962a/photo\">AP Photo/Angel Ngwe, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These factors, along with growing impatience over the question of succession, likely influenced the decision of the northern-based leader <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w41yqjnqno\">Issa Tchiroma to leave government</a> and challenge Biya in the 2025 election.

Cameroon’s election management body took a painstaking 15 days to declare Biya the victor with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/cameroon-paul-biya-oldest-serving-head-of-state-declared-winner-in-election\">just 54% of the vote</a>, his lowest showing since 1992. Given the obvious factionalism and Biya’s weakness, it would have been inconceivable to claim any larger of a victory. </p>\n\n<h2>The shifting tides of authoritarianism</h2>\n\n<p>While each election might have been a victory for autocracy, these are different autocracies from what they were 20 years ago. Importantly, the electoral contests tell us that authoritarian governments are dynamic – and even potentially at risk.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Tanzania, there has been a gradual unwinding of key sources of longevity in favor of more blatant and brutal tools of authoritarian rule. Hassan vote share is a reminder of sham results seen in places like <a href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2022/11/27/worlds-longest-serving-teodoro-obiang-wins-6th-term-in-equatorial-guinea//\">Equatorial Guinea</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnk413ze07lo\">Rwanda</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in Cameroon we are witnessing the logical unfolding of a highly personalized autocracy that has been unwilling to deal with its own internal contradictions. In both 2025 and 1992, Biya faced a frayed political coalition that sensed his vulnerability. The difference this time is that Biya does not have another 30 years ahead of him to rebuild a political coalition. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, these are autocracies in transition and entering into a new status quo that seems much more fragile. It is unclear what new equilibriums will emerge.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270718/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Yonatan Morse does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Recent profiles in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-randy-fine/684939/\">The Atlantic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">The New York Times</a> have elevated the 27-year-old into practically a household name. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George-Michael-8/2\">But as a scholar of the American right</a>, I’ve been fascinated by one aspect of Fuentes’ rise: the way some Black podcast hosts and political influencers have been receptive to some of his views.</p>\n\n<p>“Isn’t that amazing?” Black pastor and radio host Jesse Lee Peterson <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v3uc5hk-jesse-lee-peterson-interviews-nick-fuentes.html\">gushed after hosting Fuentes on his show in 2023</a>. “Finally, a white man standing up for what is right. And you heard him say it – he hate no one.”   </p>\n\n<p>At first blush, this might sound counterintuitive. Fuentes champions a racist vision of national populism. He has promoted the idea that the country’s identity <a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/video/B0NRT5aA3xSn\">depends on preserving its white majority</a>. In the past, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHgm-7nW0Y0\">he’s defended Jim Crow</a>, the segregationist legal regime that governed the South from the late-19th century to the 1960s, arguing that segregation was better for both Black and white Americans. <a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/video/UWLFEoPYGzbe\">He’s openly disavowed miscegenation</a>, and castigated Vice President JD Vance for marrying an Indian woman and fathering mixed-race children.</p>\n\n<p>Black people and white nationalists, however, <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/black-nationalism-white-supremacy\">have joined forces in the past</a>. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306352/whiteshift-by-kaufmann-eric/9780141986630\">And a number of cultural and political shifts</a> have broadened Fuentes’ appeal to Americans of all races. </p>\n\n<h2>Finding common ground</h2>\n\n<p>In the 20th century, Black and white nationalists were able to find common ground on the topic of racial separatism.  </p>\n\n<p>Marcus Garvey, <a href=\"https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/back-to-africa-movement-4/\">a leading proponent of the back-to-Africa movement</a> in the 1920s, and Elijah Muhammad, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/26/archives/elijah-muhammad-dead-black-muslim-leader-77-elijah-muhammad-dead.html\">the former leader of the Nation of Islam</a>, saw white nationalists as kindred spirits. </p>\n\n<p>Garvey envisaged a new nation built by the descendants of African slaves. To him, the ostensible racism of the Ku Klux Klan helped drive home his message that the U.S. would never be a place that could incorporate Black people as equals. In 1922, he met with Edward Young Clarke, the Klan’s acting leader. <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/marcus-garvey-meets-kkk\">Garvey later explained how the two shared the same vision</a>: Clarke “believes America to be a white man’s country, and also states that the Negro should have a country of his own in Africa.”</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Muhammad <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/black-islam-america-renouncing-radicalism\">embraced the idea of Black superiority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/26/archives/rockwell-us-nazi-slain-exaide-is-held-as-sniper-rockwell-slain.html\">George Lincoln Rockwell</a>, the leader of the American Nazi Party from 1959 to 1967, Muhammad saw a white man who may have disagreed about which race was superior but was nonetheless serious about carving out a territory somewhere in the U.S. to build a separate Black nation. Even though Rockwell <a href=\"https://www.christianidentityaustralia.org/reads/George-Interview.pdf\">spoke of Black people</a> as a “primitive race” and had organized a “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/08/21/the-shadow-of-an-assassinated-american-nazi-commander-hangs-over-charlottesville/\">hate tour</a>,” <a href=\"https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/george-lincoln-rockwell-attend-nation-islam-1961/\">Muhammad invited him to speak at the Nation of Islam summit in 1962</a>. To Muhammad, they both had the same goal: separation of the races.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Uniting in opposition to Israel</h2>\n\n<p>Importantly, among both Black nationalists and white nationalists, race mixing was often cast in an antisemitic framework, with <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/essays/role-jewish-americans-civil-rights-movement\">Jews accused of spurring racial integration</a>. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/americanfuehrerg00fred\">Rockwell claimed</a> Jewish communists were behind the Civil Rights Movement, while the Nation of Islam <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Blacks_and_Jews\">published a pseudo-historical book in 1991</a> claiming that Jews were responsible for the transatlantic slave trade.</p>\n\n<p>Today, antizionism and antisemitism are where Fuentes and some Black conservatives appear to have found common ground.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s ensuing annihilation of Gaza have destabilized politics not only in the Middle East <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/politics/us-politics-october-7-analysis\">but also in the U.S</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/01/09/newspapers-israel-palestine-bias-new-york-times/\">the mainstream media</a> in the U.S. has championed Israel, while <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/history-us-support-israel-runs-deep-growing-chorus/story?id=104957109\">both of the country’s major political parties</a> have backed Israel financially and militarily.</p>\n\n<p>However, due to a number of factors – including Americans’ widespread exposure on social media <a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/10/10/tiktok-palestine-posts-israel-hamas-war-research/\">to the destruction of Gaza</a>, <a href=\"https://aapidata.com/blog/aapi-perspectives-on-u-s-support-for-israel-palestine-2/\">the growing diversity of the U.S.</a> <a href=\"https://www.notmytaxdollars.org/\">and its ballooning debt</a> – <a href=\"https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/democrats-and-republicans-grapple-internal-divisions-israel\">cracks in this uniform support</a> have emerged.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Fuentes routinely implicates a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/conservative-reaction-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview\">Jewish oligarchy</a>” as the source of many problems that bedevil the world today, and his strident denunciation of Israel and the larger Jewish community has endeared him to antisemites and anti-Israel factions on the right, and this includes some Black Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-manosphere-found-its-way-into-the-black-community-226710\">Myron Gaines</a>, an internet personality who founded the “Fresh and Fit Podcast” in 2020. Born in Brooklyn, Gaines is of Sudanese descent and was raised as a Muslim. Originally, his podcast focused on issues related to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive\">the manosphere</a>, a largely online movement that champions masculinity and opposes feminism.</p>\n\n<p>But since the Oct. 7 attacks, Gaines became a vociferous critic of Israel, claiming “<a href=\"https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/jta/fresh-and-fit-host-myron-gaines-defends-leaked-gop-antisemitic-group-chat-yeah-we-like/article_f5c692e8-fc91-549f-936c-db4c5c752c09.html\">Zionist fingerprints</a>” were “all over” the 9/11 attacks and JFK’s assassination. On this issue, he found common ground with Fuentes, who has frequently appeared as a guest on his program. On occasion, Andrew Tate, a popular British biracial social media personality, has joined them for discussions.</p>\n\n<p>All three share <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2025/10/16/united-states/fresh-and-fit-host-myron-gaines-defends-leaked-gop-antisemitic-group-chat-yeah-we-like-hitler?\">an antisemitic worldview</a> – promoting, at various points, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/influencer-andrew-tate-returns-to-us-bringing-his-misogynistic-antisemitism-with-him/\">the notion of Jewish control</a> of finance, media and governments – with a pronounced misogynist streak.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are the Hodgetwins, Keith and Kevin Hodge. The Black twin brothers launched their podcast in 2008 and now boast an estimated 2 million followers. They’ve recently interviewed a range of antisemitic guests on their program, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hodgetwins-nick-fuentes-go-in-on-ben-shapiro-israel/id1731232810?i=1000735137573\">including Fuentes</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/HodgetwinsPod/status/1864407581709447539\">David Duke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thehodgetwins/posts/yall-see-our-new-podcast-with-leonarda-joniea-female-comedian-that-will-actually/1248109886671596/\">Leonarda Jonie</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1YqxovgewZgJv?lang=en\">Stew Peters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, Candace Owens <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6w2hyk-candace-owens-x-nick-fuentes-interview-full-71125.html\">hosted Nick Fuentes for a two-hour interview</a> on her podcast. They had traded barbs in the past, but they had also, at times, praised each other. When Owens was fired from The Daily Wire for her criticism of Israel in 2024, Fuentes instructed his supporters to “<a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/candace-owens/right-wing-and-far-right-media-throw-their-support-behind-candace-owens-amid-her\">stand with Candace</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>During the July 2025 interview, there were some tense moments: Owens needled Fuentes over why he hadn’t married and started a family. She also objected to his belief that race determined a person’s abilities and to his claim that Black civilization was inherently inferior. But the tone was generally cordial, and they agreed that the pro-Israel lobby had an outsized influence on American politics.</p>\n\n<h2>Race is becoming less black and white</h2>\n\n<p>There’s also a broader cultural shift at play: Racial identity is becoming increasingly fluid.</p>\n\n<p>As political scientist Eric Kaufmann argued in his 2019 book, “<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306352/whiteshift-by-kaufmann-eric/9780141986630\">Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities</a>,” America may be becoming more racially diverse, but this doesn’t necessarily portend a politics of racial liberalism. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, he argues that those with multiracial backgrounds will tend to identify – and be identified – with the largest and most socially dominant racial group. In other words, a significant number of multiracial Americans will “airbrush” their polyglot lineage and instead focus on their European provenance. As racial boundaries become more fluid, more people of multiracial heritage <a href=\"https://news.law.fordham.edu/blog/2022/03/14/the-rise-of-white-nationalist-hispanics/\">may come to culturally and politically identify as white</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Just as President Donald Trump was able <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/voting-patterns-in-the-2024-election/\">to draw a higher share of Black and Latino voters</a> than any GOP presidential candidate in recent memory, Fuentes has been able to connect with nonwhite audiences. And just as <a href=\"https://www.fox4news.com/news/oath-keepers-founder-stewart-rhodes-path-from-yale-to-jail\">Stewart Rhodes</a>, the founder of the right-wing, anti-immigrant Oath Keepers, is part Hispanic, the former leader of the “Western chauvinist” Proud Boys, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/opinion/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-latinos-racism.html\">Enrique Tarrio</a>, is Afro-Cuban American.</p>\n\n<p>Fuentes himself reflects this trend. He acknowledges <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/6/2/why-white-supremacists-are-not-always-white\">his Mexican ancestry</a> – from his paternal grandfather – and yet remains an unapologetic white nationalist, calling for “<a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/10/nick-fuentes-texas-meeting/\">total Aryan victory</a>.”  </p>\n\n<p>Black podcasters may be amenable to Fuentes due to the country’s racial reality. Any program of forced racial expulsion and separation simply doesn’t seem feasible in contemporary, multiracial America. </p>\n\n<p>Fuentes seems to recognize this; in fact, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-wing-commentator-nick-fuentes-says-gop-must-be-replaced-with-a-leftright-coalition-that-party-would-win-90-of-votes/articleshow/125464581.cms\">he recently called for a united populist front</a> to include the political left. He urged leftists to jettison their advocacy of open borders and wokeism. Meanwhile, he’s counseled the political right to abandon its reverence for the free market. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Fuentes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRuH8yjGK2U\">favors a form of national socialism</a> not unlike the kind that emerged in fascist Germany and Italy. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/young-men-nick-fuentes-influencer-bhs87k3p5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcjQ-C7RaUBnewOIH9Lh5ELcV6NRtFRQzowgwgCDzoU1DdeQWuIRrVOVluzQP0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69421364&amp;gaa_sig=PA5azNBFjgagS-41oKEGnOZ1jEpNt215tc1Eh5pkV5Hi6-R2aR5uYD1XxqP5MKpeF_7CCYdqo9TL5yFwwKCz2g%3D%3D\">But for Gen Zers who are experiencing economic uncertainty and social isolation</a>, such a program can sound attractive – no matter their race.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270437/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>George Michael does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Officials – especially in rural communities – are also raising some red flags about declining public engagement, deteriorating public discourse and harassment.</p>\n\n<h2>The view from city hall</h2>\n\n<p>At the University of Michigan’s <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/\">Center for Local, State and Urban Policy</a>, we have been surveying local officials in Michigan’s 1,856 cities, villages, counties and townships since 2009. About 70% of local governments in the state complete our survey each year, which means that our results reflect the opinions of everyone from township clerks in the Upper Peninsula to mayors of larger cities in the Metro Detroit area. </p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey\">Michigan Public Policy Survey</a> has covered a wide variety of <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/browse-topics\">local issues</a> over the years. One topic we track closely is how <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/138/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-trust-residents-less-say-local-democracy-remains-strong\">democracy is functioning</a> in <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/137/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-report-alarming-declines-resident-engagement\">local communities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While many public opinion surveys ask how Americans feel about democracy, very few examine the viewpoints of local officials whose job it is to carry out the daily work of democratic governance. For example, instead of asking whether people trust their government, we flip the question around and ask local officials whether they <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/data-table/michigan-public-policy-survey-mpps/spring-2025-data/q29\">trust their residents</a> to be responsible participants in policymaking.</p>\n\n<h2>Democracy at its grassroots is strong</h2>\n\n<p>To get a high-level understanding of local democratic health, we ask Michigan local officials to rate the overall functioning of democracy in their communities on a scale of 1 to 10, from total breakdown to perfectly functioning. </p>\n\n<p>Statewide, <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/138/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-trust-residents-less-say-local-democracy-remains-strong\">82% reported</a> a score of 7 or higher when we surveyed them in the spring of 2025. This percentage has remained remarkably steady since we first began tracking it in 2020. </p>\n\n<p>At the other end of the scale, only 2% of communities this year rated democracy poorly – 4 or below – falling from a high of 7% in 2024. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"0tEl5\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0tEl5/6/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Small and rural communities are falling behind</h2>\n\n<p>While these high ratings are good news for local democracy in general, when we break down the results by whether communities consider themselves more urban or rural, we see some divergence. While 82% of communities overall reported relatively good democratic health this year, this reflects <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/data-table/michigan-public-policy-survey-mpps/spring-2025-data/q46a\">92% of urban communities</a> and 79% of rural communities. </p>\n\n<p>We also see evidence of a growing urban/rural divide in <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/137/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-report-alarming-declines-resident-engagement\">resident engagement</a>, an essential ingredient of democratic health. When we asked local officials how engaged their residents were with their local governments, <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/data-table/michigan-public-policy-survey-mpps/spring-2025-data/q27\">64% of urban communities</a> said their residents were somewhat or very engaged, but only 41% of rural communities felt the same. In fact, 13% of rural communities said their residents are not engaged at all, compared with only 5% of urban communities.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"QQxiq\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QQxiq/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, local officials in urban communities have higher levels of trust in their residents to be <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/138/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-trust-residents-less-say-local-democracy-remains-strong\">responsible participants</a> in local policymaking – for example, by contributing ideas, volunteering or speaking with elected officials. In Michigan’s urban communities, <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/data-table/michigan-public-policy-survey-mpps/spring-2025-data/q29\">48% of local officials</a> said they trust their residents nearly always or most of the time. However, only 38% of rural local officials had the same level of trust in their residents.</p>\n\n<h2>The big picture looks less rosy</h2>\n\n<p>While rural communities currently appear to be struggling more than urban communities to engage with their residents, looking over time, democratic participation is getting worse everywhere. For example, <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/data-table/michigan-public-policy-survey-mpps/spring-2025-data/q30c\">18% of Michigan communities</a> statewide reported this year that civic discourse among residents was somewhat or very divisive, up from 11% in 2012. </p>\n\n<p>Between 2012 and today, despite their efforts to expand engagement opportunities, particularly online, <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/137/mpps-michigan-local-leaders-report-alarming-declines-resident-engagement\">local officials’ satisfaction</a> with their residents’ level of engagement has plummeted from 58% in 2012 to 38% in 2025. Among the most common frustrations are that their efforts attract the same people over and over and that a small vocal minority of residents is negatively affecting overall engagement. </p>\n\n<p>Even more troubling, about half of local officials who responded to the 2022 version of our survey have experienced some kind of personal harassment, with <a href=\"https://closup.umich.edu/michigan-public-policy-survey/88/the-functioning-of-democracy-at-the-local-level-a-compendium-of-findings-from-the-michigan-public-policy-survey-of-local-leaders\">39% reporting</a> in-person harassment such as hostile or aggressive comments, 31% reporting online harassment and 3% reporting violent actions like assault or destruction of property. </p>\n\n<h2>Looking ahead</h2>\n\n<p>While only <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/12/04/public-trust-in-government-1958-2025/\">17% of Americans</a> currently trust the federal government to “do what is right” “just about always” or “most of the time,” according to a recent Pew survey, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/697421/trust-government-depends-upon-party-control.aspx\">65% of Americans</a> still trust their local government. And as our survey results suggest, most local officials feel pretty confident that they’re being good stewards of local democracy, despite declining help and input from their residents. </p>\n\n<p>To any Americans worried about the state of their democracy, may we suggest heading to the next meeting of the local planning commission? We hear there are <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/galleries/644UQT7UGZBB5O2XHPPPTNWUDM/\">sometimes even snacks</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/detroit-michigan-news\">our stories about Michigan</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271672/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephanie Leiser does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Essentially, it is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2206346\">marker of inflammation</a> – meaning <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">immune system activation</a> – in the body.</p>\n\n<p>C-reactive protein can be easily measured with blood work at the doctor’s office. A low C-reactive protein level – under 1 milligram per deciliter – signifies minimal inflammation in the body, which is protective against heart disease. An elevated C-reactive protein level of greater than 3 milligrams per deciliter, signifies increased levels of inflammation and thus <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092444\">increased risk for heart disease</a>. About 52% of Americans have an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200504143521525\">elevated level of C-reactive protein</a> in their blood.</p>\n\n<p>Research shows that C-reactive protein is a better predictive marker for heart attacks and strokes than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405182\">“bad,” or LDL cholesterol, short for low-density lipoprotein</a>, as well as another commonly measured genetically inherited biomarker called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2405182\">lipoprotein(a)</a>. One study found that C-reactive protein <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61717-7\">can predict heart disease just as well as blood pressure can</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Why does inflammation matter in heart disease?</h2>\n\n<p>Inflammation plays a crucial role at every stage in the development and buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which causes a condition called <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569\">atherosclerosis</a> that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0902.104353\">lead to heart attacks and strokes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From the moment a blood vessel is damaged, be it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71433\">from high blood sugar</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2613.2000.00162.x\">cigarette smoke</a>, immune cells immediately infiltrate the area. Those immune cells subsequently engulf cholesterol particles that are typically floating around in the blood stream to form a fatty plaque that resides in the wall of the vessel. </p>\n\n<p>This process continues for decades until eventually, one day, immune mediators rupture the cap that encloses the plaque. This triggers the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow, starves the surrounding tissues of oxygen and ultimately causes a heart attack or stroke.  </p>\n\n<p>Hence, cholesterol is only part of the story; it is, in fact, the immune system that facilitates each step in the processes that drive heart disease.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a

important predictor of risk for heart disease, it does remain highly relevant. </p>\n\n<p>However, it’s not just the amount of cholesterol – or more specifically the amount of bad, or LDL, cholesterol – that matters. Two people with the same cholesterol level don’t necessarily have the same risk for heart disease. This is because risk is determined more so by the number of particles that the bad cholesterol is packaged into, as opposed to the total mass of bad cholesterol that’s floating around. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885\">More particles means higher risk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That is why a blood test known as <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test\">apolipoprotein B</a>, which measures the number of cholesterol particles, is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083\">measurements of total amounts of bad cholesterol</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Like cholesterol and C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B is also influenced by lifestyle factors <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722\">like exercise</a>, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4\">weight loss</a> and diet. Nutrients like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422416000147\">fiber, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids</a> are associated with a decreased number of cholesterol particles, while <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9030211\">increased sugar intake is associated with a larger number</a> of cholesterol particles.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/genetic-conditions/lipoprotein-a\">lipoprotein(a)</a>, a protein that lives in the wall surrounding cholesterol particles, is another marker that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000147\">can predict heart disease more accurately than cholesterol levels</a>. This is because the presence of lipoprotein(a) makes cholesterol particles sticky, so to speak, and thus more likely to get trapped in an atherosclerotic plaque. </p>\n\n<p>However, unlike other risk factors, lipoprotein(a) levels are purely genetic, thus not influenced by lifestyle, and need only be measured once in a lifetime.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s the best way to prevent heart disease?</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, heart disease is the product of many risk factors and their interactions over a lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, preventing heart disease is way more complicated than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/128.2.449S\">simply eating a cholesterol-free diet, as once thought</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing your LDL cholesterol level alongside your C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) levels paints a comprehensive picture of risk that can hopefully help motivate long-term commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age\">fundamentals of heart disease prevention</a>. These include eating well, exercising consistently, getting adequate sleep, managing stress productively, maintaining healthy weight and, if applicable, quitting smoking.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271143/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mary J.

I am currently writing a book about modern parenting, and I’ve noticed that <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/98/1/31/5257458\">many parents</a> try to help their kids avoid boredom. They might see it as a negative emotion that they don’t want their children to experience. Or they might steer them into doing something that they see as more productive.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://mwstewart.com/books/the-9-9-percent\">various reasons</a> they want to prevent their children from being bored. Many <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf\">parents are busy</a> with work. They’re stressed about money, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/parents/index.html\">child care responsibilities and managing other parts of daily life</a>. Making sure a child is occupied with a game, a TV show or an arts and crafts project at home can help parents work uninterrupted, or make dinner, without their children complaining that they are bored. </p>\n\n<p>Parents may also feel pressure for their children to succeed, whether that means getting admitted to a selective school, or <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/07/children-continue-to-be-involved-in-extracurricular-activities.html\">becoming a good athlete</a> or an accomplished musician.</p>\n\n<p>Children also spend less time playing freely outside and more time participating in structured activities <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/03/230309101330.htm\">than they did a few decades ago</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Easy access to screens has made it possible to avoid boredom more than ever before. </p>\n\n<p>Many parents needed to put their children in front of screens throughout the pandemic to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.13038\">keep them occupied during work hours</a>. More recently, some parents have reported feeling social pressure to <a href=\"https://slate.com/life/2025/03/parenting-advice-public-restaurants-toddler-behavior.html\">use screens to keep children quiet in public spaces</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That is to say, there are various reasons why parents shy away from their kids being bored. But before striving to eliminate boredom completely, it’s important to know the benefits of boredom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young girl with dark hair lays on her stomach on a couch with her arms and legs splayed out.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709533/original/file-20251217-56-wgaim2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Even very young children could benefit from experiencing boredom in short spurts.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-asian-girl-feeling-bored-lying-on-sofa-royalty-free-image/1308285129?phrase=boredom%20children&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Oscar Wong/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Benefits of boredom</h2>\n\n<p>Although boredom feels bad to experience in the moment, it offers real benefits for <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/08/you-need-to-be-bored-heres-why\">personal growth</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Boredom is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000097\">signal that a change is needed</a>, whether it be a change in scenery, activity or company. Psychologists have found that the experience of boredom can lead to discovering <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/3/3/459\">new goals</a> and trying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000097\">new activities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Harvard public and nonprofit leadership professor Arthur Brooks has found that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/08/you-need-to-be-bored-heres-why\">boredom is necessary</a> for reflection. Downtime leaves room to ask the big questions in life and find meaning. </p>\n\n<p>Children who are rarely bored <a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/boost-your-brain-with-boredom/\">could become adults</a> who cannot cope with boredom. Boredom also offers a brain boost that can cultivate a child’s innate curiosity and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>Learning to manage boredom and other negative emotions is an important life skill. When children manage their own time, it can help them <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00593\">develop executive function</a>, which includes the ability to set goals and make plans. </p>\n\n<p>The benefits of boredom make sense from an evolutionary perspective. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0000232\">Boredom is extremely common</a>. It affects <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-017-9515-1\">all ages, genders and cultures</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.09.021\">teens are especially prone to boredom</a>. Natural selection favors traits that offer a leg up, so it is unlikely that boredom would be so prevalent if it did not deliver some advantages. </p>\n\n<p>Parents should be wary of treating boredom as a problem they must solve for their children. Psychologists have found that college students with overly involved <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-013-9716-3\">parents suffer from more depression</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2022.4793\">Other research</a> shows that young children who were given screens to help them calm down were less equipped to regulate their emotions as they got older.</p>\n\n<h2>Boredom is uncomfortable</h2>\n\n<p>Tolerating boredom is a skill that many children resist learning or do not have the opportunity to develop. Even many adults would <a href=\"https://dtg.sites.fas.harvard.edu/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf\">rather shock themselves with electricity</a> than experience boredom. </p>\n\n<p>It takes practice to learn how to handle boredom. Start with small doses of boredom and work up to longer stretches of unstructured time. <a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/boost-your-brain-with-boredom/\">Tips for parents</a> include getting kids outside, suggesting a new game or recipe, or simply resting. Creating space for boredom means that there will be some stretches of time when nothing in particular is happening.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/well/family/kids-summer-boredom.html\">Younger children might need ideas for what they could do when bored</a>. Parents do not need to play with them every time they are bored, but offering suggestions is helpful. Even five minutes of boredom is a good start for the youngest children.</p>\n\n<p>Encouraging older children to solve the problem of boredom themselves is especially empowering. Let them know that boredom is a normal part of life even though it might feel unpleasant. </p>\n\n<h2>It gets easier</h2>\n\n<p>Children are adaptable.</p>\n\n<p>As children get used to occasional boredom, it will take them longer to become bored in the future. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/08/you-need-to-be-bored-heres-why\">People find life less boring once they regularly experience boredom</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Letting go of the obligation to keep children entertained could also help parents feel less stressed. Approximately 41% of parents in the U.S. said they “are so stressed they cannot function,” and 48% reported that “most days their stress is completely overwhelming,” according to <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/parents-under-pressure.pdf\">a report from the U.S. surgeon general in 2024</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So the next time a kid complains, “I’m bored!” don’t feel guilty or frustrated. Boredom is a healthy part of life. It prompts us to be self-directed, find new hobbies and take on new challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Let children know that a little boredom isn’t just OK – in fact, it’s good for them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268826/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Margaret Murray does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

His sons, John Jr. and William, and later his granddaughter Ann Bartram Carr, continued to expand the garden, which gained international fame during the 18th and 19th centuries. </p>\n\n<p>The rat nest was discovered during historic preservation work at the Bartram home in 1977. My analysis of the materials in the nest indicates that it was formed in the late 18th and early 19th century. The materials are representative of the plants rodents would have been foraging from the Bartram home and garden. </p>\n\n<p>The plants I identified weren’t restricted to those sold by the Bartram family as a part of their nursery business. Nor were they limited to plants that were traded between naturalists hoping to learn more about the flora of the American Colonies. They included crops such as wheat, buckwheat, corn, parsnips and beans grown by the family to feed themselves; herbs such as lemongrass, basil and mint used for medicine by the family; and many wild and weedy plants – for example, brambles, corn cockle, and broom and needle grasses – that were not intentionally grown by the Bartrams but were nonetheless collected by the rats on the property. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Small pentagon-shaped white trays including organic materials\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=278&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=278&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=278&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707898/original/file-20251210-64-qs6myw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Materials from the rat nest in the process of being sorted by the author, including hickory, walnuts, acorns, corn and peanuts.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Alexandria Mitchem Hansen</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By studying the plants foraged by these rats, I learned not only about the important scientific and commercial plants in the garden, but also about the food and medicine the family were eating and using, including imported snacks such as peanuts and Brazil nuts, which were not grown in the garden but could have been purchased in Philadelphia. </p>\n\n<h2>Sorting 11 pounds of material</h2>\n\n<p>I am an archaeobotanist, which means I recover and identify plants from the past. </p>\n\n<p>Over the course of almost three years, I sorted through over 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of material from the rat nest recovered from the Bartrams’ home and stored at <a href=\"https://www.penn.museum/sites/caam/\">the Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials</a> at the Penn Museum.</p>\n\n<p>Because there is often a lot of material, archaeologists divide these kinds of samples using geological sieves, which are scientific screening tools that filter samples by size. This makes the material easier to sort. </p>\n\n<p>Then I used a microscope to sort and identify the plants therein. Archaeobotanists find various parts of plants, including seeds, chaff, fruit pits, nutshells and cobs. The plants I identified ranged in size from whole corncobs to weed seeds smaller than half a millimeter. </p>\n\n<p>To identify the species of plants, I used reference manuals, comparative collections of plant seeds and other parts, and help from the archaeobotanists at the Penn Museum. I also studied images from herbaria, which are collections of historic plants that have been preserved and archived.  </p>\n\n<p>In the future, I plan to focus on the weedy plants recovered from the rat nest. The majority of invasive species in the United States were originally introduced in horticultural contexts, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0103:HAAPOI%5D2.0.CO;2\">including botanic gardens and nurseries</a>.

Despite a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/moderate-republicans-buck-leadership-back-democrat-effort-extend/story?id=128485292\">last-ditch attempt in the House to extend ACA subsidies</a>, with Congress adjourning for the year on Dec. 19, it’s looking almost certain that Americans relying on ACA subsidies will face a steep increase in health care costs in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>As a gerontologist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vfl8OecAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">studies the U.S. health care system</a>, I’m aware that disagreements about health care in America have a long history. The main bone of contention is whether providing health care is the responsibility of the government, or of individuals or their employers. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/health-policy-101-the-affordable-care-act/\">The ACA</a>, passed in 2010 as the country’s first major piece of health legislation since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, represents one more chapter in that long-standing debate. That debate explains why the health law has fueled so much political divisiveness – including a standoff <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/health-insurance-subsidy-standoff-pits-affordable-care-for-millions-against-federal-budget-constraints-266851\">that spurred a record-breaking 43-day-long government shutdown</a>, which began on Oct. 1, 2025.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, regardless of how Congress resolves, or doesn’t resolve, the current dispute over ACA subsidies, a durable U.S. health care policy will remain out of reach until lawmakers address the core question of who should shoulder the cost of health care.</p>\n\n<h2>The ACA’s roots</h2>\n\n<p>In the years before the ACA’s passage, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26099/RNMW-1386\">some 49 million Americans</a> – 15% of the population – lacked health insurance. This number had been <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/decline_in_employer-sponsored_health_coverage_accelerated/\">rising in the wake of the 2008 recession</a>. That’s because the majority of Americans ages 18 to 64 with health insurance receive their health benefits through their employer. In the 2008 downturn, people who lost their jobs basically lost their health care coverage. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Seated man talks to a doctor in a clinic waiting room.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709801/original/file-20251218-56-efm4bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The goal of the Affordable Care Act was to significantly decrease the number of Americans without health insurance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/happy-man-talking-to-his-doctor-at-medical-clinic-royalty-free-image/2208809544\">Drazen Zigic/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For those who believed government had a primary role in providing health insurance for its citizens, the growing number of people lacking coverage <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.301180\">hit a crisis point that required an intervention</a>. Those who place responsibility on individuals and employers <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/why-the-personal-mandate-buy-health-insurance-unprecedented-and\">saw the ACA as perversion of the government’s purpose</a>. The political parties could find no common ground – and this challenge continues.  </p>\n\n<p>The major goal of the ACA was to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/003335491112600118\">reduce the number of uninsured Americans by about 30 million people</a>, or to about 3% of the U.S. population. It got about halfway there: Today, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/uninsured/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/\">about 26 million Americans</a>, or 8%, are uninsured, though this number fluctuates based on changes in the economy and federal and state policy. </p>\n\n<h2>Health insurance for all?</h2>\n\n<p>The ACA implemented an array of strategies to accomplish this goal. Some were popular, such as allowing parents to <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2025/08/12/26-health-insurance/\">keep their kids on their family insurance</a> until age 26. Some were unpopular, such as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.01.032\">mandate that everyone must have insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But two strategies in particular had the biggest impact on the number of uninsured. One was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41271-024-00522-0\">expanding the Medicaid program</a> to include workers whose income was below 138% of the poverty line. The other was <a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/affordable-care-act-new-way-forward/2011-11\">providing subsidies to people</a> with low and moderate incomes that could help them buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, a state or federal health exchange through which consumers could choose health insurance plans. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/from-drew-altman/on-medicaid-expansion-history-matters/\">Medicaid expansion was controversial</a> from the start. Originally, the ACA mandated it for all states, but the Supreme Court eventually <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/a-guide-to-the-supreme-courts-decision/\">ruled that it was up to each state</a>, not the federal government, to decide whether to do so. As of December 2025, 40 states and the District of Columbia have implemented Medicaid expansion, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a-literature-review/\">insuring about 20 million Americans</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the marketplace subsidies, which were designed to help people who were working but could not access an employer-based health plan, were not especially contentious early on. Everyone receiving a subsidy was required to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/\">contribute to their insurance plan’s monthly premium</a>. People earning US$18,000 or less annually, which in 2010 was 115% of the income threshold set by the federal government as poverty level, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">contributed 2.1% of their plan’s cost</a>, and those earning $60,240, which was 400% of the federal poverty level, contributed 10%. People making more than that were not eligible for subsidies at all. </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319\">legislation passed by the Biden administration</a> to stave off the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the subsidy that people could receive. The law eliminated premiums entirely for the lowest income people and reduced the cost for those earning more. And, unlike before, people making more than 400% of the federal poverty level – about 10% of marketplace enrollees – could also get a subsidy. </p>\n\n<p>These pandemic-era subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost versus coverage</h2>\n\n<p>If the COVID-19-era subsidies expire, health care costs would increase substantially for most consumers, as ACA subsidies return to their original levels. So someone making $45,000 annually will now need to pay $360 a month for health insurance, increasing their payment by 74%, or $153 monthly. What’s more, these changes come <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/\">on top of price hikes to insurance plans themselves</a>, which are estimated to increase by about 18% in 2026. </p>\n\n<p>With these two factors combined, many ACA marketplace users could see their health insurance cost rise more than 100%. Some proponents of extending COVID-19-era  subsidies contend that the rollback will result in an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26099/RNMW-1386\">estimated 6 million to 7 million people leaving</a> the ACA marketplace and that some 5 million of these Americans could become uninsured in 2026.    </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O33vfsIWG1c?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Congressional gridlock over a health care bill continues.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Policies in the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">tax and spending package</a> signed into law by President Donald Trump in July 2025 are amplifying the challenge of keeping Americans insured. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Medicaid cuts alone, stipulated in the package, may result in <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61420\">more than 7 million people becoming uninsured</a>. Combined with other policy changes outlined in the law and the rollback of the ACA subsidies, that number <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">could hit 16 million by 2034</a> – essentially wiping out the majority of gains in health insurance coverage that the ACA achieved since 2010. </p>\n\n<h2>Subsidy downsides</h2>\n\n<p>These enhanced ACA subsidies are so divisive now in part because they have dramatically driven up the federal government’s health care bill. Between 2021 and 2024, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/health-insurance-premium-spikes-imminent-as-tax-credit-enhancements-set-to-expire\">the number of people receiving subsidies doubled</a> – resulting in many more people having health insurance, but also increasing federal ACA expenditures.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2025, almost 22 million Americans who purchased a marketplace plan <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/understanding-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">received a federal subsidy to help with the costs</a>, up from 9.2 million in 2020 – a 137% increase.</p>\n\n<p>Those who oppose the extension counter that the subsidies <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/six-reasons-not-extend-enhanced-obamacare-subsidies\">cost the government too much and fund high earners</a> who don’t need government support – and that temporary emergencies, even ones as serious as a pandemic, should not result in permanent changes. </p>\n\n<p>Another critique is that employers are using the ACA to <a href=\"https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/employer-sponsored-insurance-is-it-eroding-under-the-aca-and-should-we-care/\">reduce their responsibility for employee coverage</a>. Under the ACA, employers with <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/employer-shared-responsibility-provisions\">more than 50 employees must provide health insurance</a>, but for companies with fewer employers, that requirement is optional. </p>\n\n<p>In 2010, 92% of employers with 25 to 49 workers offered health insurance, but by 2025, that proportion had dropped to 64%, suggesting that companies of this size are <a href=\"https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/problems-with-aca-subsidies-compounded-by-covid-credits-unfair-to-americans-with-employer-based-insurance-punish-work-and-incentivize-employers-to-drop-coverage/\">allowing the ACA to cover their employees</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Diverging solutions</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. has <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries/\">the most expensive health care system in the world</a> by far. The projected increase in the number of uninsured people over the next 10 years <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_in_the_literature_2003_jun_the_costs_and_consequences_of_being_uninsured_davis_consequences_itl_663_pdf.pdf\">could result in even higher costs</a>, as fewer people get preventive care and delayed health care interventions, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53914/\">ultimately leading to more complex medical care</a></p>\n\n<p>Federal policy clearly shapes health insurance coverage, but state-level policies play a role too. Nationally, about 8% of people under age 65 were uninsured in 2023, yet <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-indicator/total-population/\">that rate varied widely</a> – from 3% in Massachusetts to 18.6% in Texas. States under Republican leadership on average have a <a href=\"https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/health/partisan-divide-uninsured-rates/\">higher percentage of uninsured people</a> than do those under Democratic leadership, mirroring the political differences driving the national debate over who is responsible for shouldering the costs of health care.</p>\n\n<p>With dueling ideologies come dueling solutions. For those who believe that the government is responsible for the health of its citizens, expanding health insurance coverage and financing this expansion through taxes presents a clear approach. For those who say the burden should fall on individuals, reliance on the free market drives the fix – on the premise that competition between health insurers and providers offers a more effective way to solve the cost challenges than a government intervention. </p>\n\n<p>Without finding resolution on this core issue, the U.S. will likely still be embroiled in this same debate for years, if not decades, to come.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271901/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Applebaum does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The agency accepted an advisory committee’s vote to drop a long-held recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated against hepatitis B, despite no new evidence that questions the vaccine’s long-standing safety record. </p>\n\n<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/rfk-vaccines-hhs-trump.html\">cast doubt on vaccine safety for decades</a>, has said he plans to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5576321/childhood-vaccine-schedule-rfk-cdc\">further scrutinize the vaccines children receive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I’m an <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/jake-scott\">infectious disease physician</a> who treats vaccine-preventable diseases and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UFGFuVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">reviews the clinical trial evidence</a> behind immunization recommendations. The vaccine schedule wasn’t designed in a single stroke. It was built gradually over decades, shaped by disease outbreaks, technological breakthroughs and hard-won lessons about reducing childhood illness and death. </p>\n\n<p>With federal officials now casting doubt on its foundations, it’s helpful to know how it came about.</p>\n\n<h2>The early years</h2>\n\n<p>For the first half of the 20th century, <a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/stories/magazine/smallpox-and-the-long-road-to-eradication/\">smallpox vaccination was common</a>, required by most states for school entry. But there was no unified national schedule. The combination vaccine against <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545173/\">diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis</a>, known as the DTP vaccine, emerged in 1948, and the <a href=\"https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/jonas-salk-and-polio-vaccine\">Salk polio vaccine arrived in 1955</a>, but recommendations for when and how to give them varied by state, by physician and even by neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government stepped in after tragedy struck. In 1955, a <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1570077/\">manufacturing failure at Cutter Laboratories</a> in Berkeley, California, produced batches of polio vaccine containing live virus, causing paralysis in dozens of children. The incident made clear that vaccination couldn’t remain a patchwork affair. It required federal oversight.</p>\n\n<p>In 1964, the U.S. surgeon general <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12317\">established the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP</a>, to provide expert guidance and recommendations to the CDC on vaccine use.

Each addition followed a similar pattern: a disease that killed or disabled thousands of children annually, a vaccine that proved safe and effective in trials, and a recommendation that transformed a seemingly inevitable childhood illness into something preventable. </p>\n\n<p>The rubella vaccine went beyond protecting the children who received it. Rubella, also called German measles, is mild in children but <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/12.9.798\">devastating to fetuses</a>, causing deafness, heart defects and intellectual disabilities when pregnant women are infected. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb8290\">A rubella epidemic in 1964 and 1965</a> drove this point home: 12.5 million infections and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome left thousands of children deaf or blind. Vaccinating children also helped protect pregnant women by curbing the spread of infection. By 2015, <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/news/29-4-2015-americas-region-declared-worlds-first-eliminate-rubella\">rubella had been eliminated</a> from the Americas.</p>\n\n<h2>Technology opens new doors</h2>\n\n<p>One limitation of some early bacterial vaccines was that they didn’t work well in infants. Young children’s immune systems couldn’t mount a strong response to the sugar coating on certain bacteria. In the 1980s, scientists developed a method called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1819612116\">conjugate vaccine technology</a>, in which sugars on bacterial pathogens are linked to proteins that the immune system – even in infants – can more easily respond to.   </p>\n\n<p>The first target of this innovation was a bacterium called <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine\">Haemophilus influenzae Type b, or Hib</a>. Before vaccination, Hib was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in American children, causing roughly 20,000 cases of the disease annually and killing hundreds. </p>\n\n<p>The Hib conjugate vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.nvic.org/disease-vaccine/hib/vaccine-history\">licensed for use in infants in 1990</a>, and within five years Hib disease in young children <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00044142.htm\">dropped by more than 99%</a>. Most pediatricians practicing today have never seen a case.</p>\n\n<h2>Hepatitis B and the safety net</h2>\n\n<p>In 1991, the CDC added <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hepatitis-b-shot-for-newborns-has-nearly-eliminated-childhood-infections-with-this-virus-in-the-us-265560\">hepatitis B vaccination at birth</a> to the schedule. Before then, around <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.108.5.1123\">18,000 children every year contracted the virus before their 10th birthday</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many parents wonder why newborns need this vaccine. The answer lies in biology and the limitations of screening.</p>\n\n<p>An adult who contracts hepatitis B has a 95% chance of clearing the virus. An infant infected in the first months of life has a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0102\">90% chance of developing chronic infection</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2011.12.061\">1 in 4 will eventually die</a> from liver failure or cancer. <a href=\"https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/the-abcs-of-viral-hepatitis/\">Infants can acquire the virus</a> from their mothers during birth, from infected household members or through casual contact in child care settings. The virus survives on surfaces for days and is highly contagious.</p>\n\n<p>Early strategies that targeted only high-risk groups failed because screening missed too many infected mothers. Even today, roughly 12% to 18% of pregnant women in the U.S. are never screened for hepatitis B. Until ACIP <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccine-committee-votes-to-scrap-universal-hepatitis-b-shots-for-newborns-despite-outcry-from-childrens-health-experts-271202\">dropped the recommendation in early December 2025</a>, a first dose of this vaccine at birth served as a safety net, protecting all infants regardless of whether their mothers’ infection status was accurately known.</p>\n\n<p>This safety net worked: <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf\">Hepatitis B infections in American children fell by 99%</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Access becomes a right</h2>\n\n<p>The schedule’s expansion was enabled by a crucial policy change. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.me.43.020192.002315\">From 1989 to 1991, a measles outbreak</a> swept through American cities, causing more than 55,000 cases and over 120 deaths. Investigators found that many infected children had seen doctors but never been vaccinated. Their families couldn’t afford the shots, and the system had failed to catch them.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6x-8lnImox8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, and infection can cause lifelong harm and even death in children.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Congress responded by <a href=\"https://www.nfid.org/the-lifesaving-impact-of-vaccines-for-children/\">creating the Vaccines for Children program in 1994</a>, which provides free vaccines to children who are uninsured, underinsured or on Medicaid. With cost no longer a barrier, ACIP could recommend vaccines based on science rather than worrying about who could afford them.</p>\n\n<h2>A unified standard</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, different medical organizations issued their own, sometimes conflicting, recommendations. In 1995, ACIP, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians jointly released the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4405.pdf\">first unified childhood immunization schedule</a>, the ancestor of today’s familiar grid. For the first time, parents and physicians had a single national standard. </p>\n\n<p>The schedule continued to evolve. ACIP recommended vaccinations for <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13679791/\">chickenpox</a> in 1996; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1586/14760584.2014.877846\">rotavirus in 2006</a>, replacing an <a href=\"https://historyofvaccines.org/diseases/rotavirus\">earlier version withdrawn</a> after safety monitoring detected a rare side effect; and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2017.09.014\">HPV, also in 2006</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Each addition <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-committee-behind-american-vaccine-recommendations\">followed the same rigorous process</a>: evidence review, risk-benefit analysis and a public vote by the advisory committee. </p>\n\n<h2>More vaccines, less burden</h2>\n\n<p>One fact often surprises parents: Despite the increase in recommended vaccines, the number of immune-stimulating molecules in those vaccines, called antigens, has dropped dramatically since the 1980s, which means they are less demanding on a child’s immune system. </p>\n\n<p>The whole-cell pertussis vaccine used in the 1980s alone <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220490/\">contained roughly 3,000 antigens</a>. Today’s entire schedule <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/im-a-physician-who-has-looked-at-hundreds-of-studies-of-vaccine-safety-and-heres-some-of-what-rfk-jr-gets-wrong-259659\">contains fewer than 160 antigens</a>, thanks to advances in vaccine technology that allow precise targeting of only the components needed for protection.</p>\n\n<h2>What lies ahead</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, ACIP recommended changes to the childhood schedule only when new evidence or clear shifts in disease risk demanded it. Rolling back a long-standing recommendation with no new safety data represents a significant break from that norm. </p>\n\n<p>In June 2025, Kennedy <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rfk-jrs-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisory-committee-raises-worries-about-scientific-integrity-of-health-recommendations-258674\">fired all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them</a> with his own choices, many of whom had a history of anti-vaccine views.</p>\n\n<p>Given this and other <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-claims-on-covid-19-vaccine-safety-are-unsupported-by-reliable-data-and-could-severely-hinder-vaccine-access-271028\">unprecedented changes Kennedy has made to vaccine policy</a> in his first year as health secretary, this is unlikely to be the last such reversal. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Members of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices sitting at a long table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709623/original/file-20251218-56-3ziou0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">On Dec. 5, 2025, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to withdraw a long-standing recommendation that all babies receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/members-of-the-cdc-advisory-committee-on-immunization-news-photo/2249466588\">Elijah Nouvelage/Stringer via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Kennedy, his newly appointed ACIP panel and others within HHS have pushed to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/07/hhs-vaccine-policy-europe-denmark/683640/\">align the U.S. vaccine schedule with European countries</a> such as Denmark, which recommends fewer vaccines.

Trump has designated the government of Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro as <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/17/trump-venezuela-oil-blockade-maduro-regime-terrorist-designation\">a foreign terrorist organization</a>, the first country to ever receive that designation. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. military <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis\">has killed at least 99 crew members of small boats</a> that Trump claims, without presenting evidence, were carrying <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/125948/illegal-orders-shipwrecked-boat-strike-survivors/\">illegal drugs</a> destined for the U.S. The New York Times reports, however, that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/us/politics/trump-blockade-venezuela-oil-tankers.html\">Venezuela is not a drug producer</a>, and the cocaine that transits through the country and the waters around it is generally bound for Europe.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s administration has justified the bombing of these boats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/trump-boat-attacks-killings.html\">by declaring they are manned by combatants</a>. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, told <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/10/02/venezuela-boat-strike-justification/\">the Intercept news outlet</a> that the administration “has offered no credible legal justification, evidence or intelligence for these strikes.”</p>\n\n<p>There is no war.

Despite his efforts, his speech on Feb. 5, 2003, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/18/colin-powell-un-security-council-iraq\">contained significant unsupported claims</a>, including that Hussein had authorized his military to use poison gas if the U.S. invaded. </p>\n\n<p>“Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11th world,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/05/iraq.usa2\">solemnly declared that day</a>.</p>\n\n<p>He later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/politics/colin-powell-dead.html?searchResultPosition=5\">expressed regret</a> for making the case for war. </p>\n\n<p>“I’m the one who presented it on behalf of the United States to the world,” Powell later said. By then, he said, the speech was “painful” for him personally and would forever <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/politics/iraq-war-colin-powell.html\">be a “blot” on his reputation</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Intelligence agencies pressed to justify war</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/07/usa.iraq1\">No weapons of mass destruction</a> existed in Iraq, nor was Hussein connected with al-Qaida, as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/13/alqaeda.saddam/\">Bush administration had said it was</a>. And Iraq did not release poison gas when the U.S. invaded the country. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/09/senate.intelligence/index.html\">Early postwar assessments</a> of how the U.S. could have invaded Iraq on the basis of serious false claims suggested it happened because the CIA and other intelligence agencies gave President Bush <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB418/\">false or inadequate intelligence</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But as extensive official records of <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB418/\">pre-war deliberations</a> became available to journalists and others in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, a different explanation emerged.</p>\n\n<p>John Prados, historian at the National Security Archives, discovered an explanation in hundreds of official records that meticulously document the run-up to the war. </p>\n\n<p>They revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies had let themselves be used, <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB254/index.htm\">he wrote</a>, as “a tool of a political effort, vitiating the intelligence function … They all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the Bush administration wanted to hear … The intense focus on achieving the conditions for war instead of solving an international problem led to crucial faults in military planning and diplomatic action.”</p>\n\n<p>The administration did not attempt to engage in diplomacy before deciding to go to war. There never was a serious effort, even within the administration, <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB328/index.htm\">to consider alternatives to war</a>.</p>\n\n<p>George J. Tenet, <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB328/print.htm#e\">director of the CIA</a> at the time, later wrote that “based on conversations with colleagues, in none of the meetings can anyone remember a discussion of the central questions: Was it wise to go to war? Was it the right thing to do?”</p>\n\n<h2>Most journalists accepted PR at face value</h2>\n\n<p>A dearth of serious reporting contributed to the public being ill-informed. </p>\n\n<p>Dan Kennedy, professor of journalism at Northeastern University, <a href=\"https://dankennedy.net/2025/11/05/remembering-the-iraq-war-how-knight-ridder-dug-up-the-truth-about-dick-cheneys-falsehoods/\">recently wrote</a> that only one news organization, the Washington bureau of Knight Ridder – later known as McClatchy – exposed the Bush-Cheney “administration’s lies and falsehoods during the run-up to the disastrous war in Iraq.” </p>\n\n<p>Other reporters relied on the public relations push for war being made to journalists by <a href=\"https://dankennedy.net/2025/11/05/remembering-the-iraq-war-how-knight-ridder-dug-up-the-truth-about-dick-cheneys-falsehoods/\">high-level political appointees</a> in the military, foreign service and intelligence agencies. But Knight Ridder journalists relied on expert, longtime career officers in those agencies who were “deeply troubled by what they regarded as the administration’s deliberate misrepresentation of intelligence, ranging from overstating the case to outright fabrication.”</p>\n\n<p>Lies to Congress and the public also were at the heart of the run-up to the war in Vietnam. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dc9gJvpV8xo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=7\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">President Johnson reports to Congress and the American people on the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which he said happened off the coast of Vietnam but which was later disputed.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Of the two attacks on a destroyer that the administration of President Lyndon Johnson said required an immediate vast buildup of troops in August 1964, <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/index.htm\">one was provoked by the United States and the other one never happened</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Few if any questions were asked when the House and Senate voted – with only two no votes – on the request for what would be known as the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/tonkin-gulf-resolution\">Gulf of Tonkin Resolution</a>. The resolution was used by Johnson and his successor, President Richard Nixon, to keep expanding the war for nearly a decade. By mid-1969, there were <a href=\"https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/education/week_of_april_19/#:%7E:text=In%20April%20of%201969%20the,service%20members%20from%20the%20region.\">543,400 American troops in Vietnam</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Truth and transparency are crucial</h2>\n\n<p>It may seem obvious that the most important lesson to be learned from those wars is that the president and all who contribute to decisions to go to war should tell the truth. But, as shown by the presidents who led the U.S. into wars in Iraq and Vietnam and from Trump’s daily remarks, truth is a frequent casualty. </p>\n\n<p>That increases the need for Congress, the public and the press to demand to be fully informed about these decisions that will be carried out in their name, with their money and with the blood of their sons and daughters. That’s necessary to prevent a president and Congress from making decisions that lead to consequences like these:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Iraq War, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/iraq-war-numbers-rcna75762\">4,492 American military</a> members were killed and approximately <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/20/the-iraq-war-twenty-years-on\">200,000 Iraqi civilians</a> were killed.

Many high-profile politicians weighed in with endorsements and visits. Notably, Republicans <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562700432868071\">President Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5640607-miami-mayoral-runoff-higgins-gonzalez/\">Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> endorsed Higgins’ opponent, Emilio Gonzalez. Meanwhile, Democrats Ruben Gallego – a senator from Arizona – and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-mayor-race-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez/\">supported Higgins</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Miami’s mayoralty is officially a nonpartisan position. And as the saying goes, there are no Democratic or Republican potholes; they are all of local concern.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.barry.edu/en/c-vitae/professors/sean-d-foreman-ph-d\">political scientist</a> with a particular interest in local government, and I’ve lived in the Greater Miami area for 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the “potholes” confronting Miami’s new mayor?</p>\n\n<h2>Civility on the dais</h2>\n\n<p>Former Mayor Francis Suarez has a charismatic persona, but was not a forceful presence on the dais. During his tenure, City Commission meetings <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article284140518.html\">turned into spectacles</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.politicalcortadito.com/2024/10/27/miami-commission-miguel-gabela-vs-manolo-reyes/\">shouting matches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article239103118.html\">name-calling</a>, \nand <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-commission-meeting-erupts-over-allegations-of-abuse-extortion-and-weaponization-of-government/\">allegations</a> of <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/local/2025/05/22/like-a-jerry-springer-section-shocking-allegations-grind-miami-city-commission-meeting-to-halt/\">corruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Higgins, a bilingual, soft-spoken policy wonk, has promised to set a new tone, leading with civility and compassion. The day after the election, she <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/local/2025/12/10/miami-mayor-elect-eileen-higgins-holds-news-conference-after-historic-victory/\">reiterated that promise</a>: “The era of commissioners yelling at one another and threatening to punch one another is going to stop.”</p>\n\n<h2>Affordable housing</h2>\n\n<p>Affordability and the cost of living were the <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/government-politics/2025-10-04/the-race-for-miami-mayor-whos-the-adult-in-the-room\">major substantive campaign issues</a>, with the cost of housing topping the list.</p>\n\n<p>For the second year in a row, the financial services firm UBS lists Miami as the city at <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/global-real-estate-bubble-index.html\">highest risk for a housing bubble</a>. Another study ranked the Miami metro area as the <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/business/2025-12-09/miami-metro-area-ranked-least-affordable-for-homebuyers-bankrate-report\">least affordable</a> housing market nationally.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Skyscrapers in Miami, with a couple of cranes working in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708564/original/file-20251213-56-yl1udi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A lot of the city’s recent growth has occurred in the form of new high-rise condos, which are unaffordable on a working-class salary.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-aerial-view-of-condo-buildings-in-the-downtown-area-on-news-photo/2228117875?adppopup=true\">Joe Raedle/Getty Images News via Getty Images North America</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The good news: This rise in price appears to be fueled by a <a href=\"https://www.floridajobs.org/news-center/DEO-Press/2025/09/19/floridacommerce-announces-the-miami-area-august-2025-employment-data\">strong employment market</a>. But the shortage of housing priced for middle- and working-class families is unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>While housing supply and prices are largely determined by market forces, government officials can set conditions to promote targeted investments. Higgins has suggested forming a <a href=\"https://www.miamidade.gov/global/news-item.page?Mduid_news=news1652374939980592\">city-run housing trust fund</a>, similar to Miami-Dade County. She has also proposed dedicating city-owned land to <a href=\"https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2025/12/11/after-unexpected-mayoral-election-result-several-miami-attorneys-are-optimistic-about-real-estate-/?slreturn=20251212151513\">affordable housing projects</a> and <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article313559686.html\">reforming the city’s permit process</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Charter reform</h2>\n\n<p>Charter reform issues, including moving city elections from odd to even years to align with national elections, are on the agenda. Though a court deemed the City Commission’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/miami-election-constitution-violation.html\">attempt to move this year’s election invalid</a>, Higgins said she <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/government-politics/2025-10-04/the-race-for-miami-mayor-whos-the-adult-in-the-room\">supports moving the election date</a>, pledging to cut her term short to facilitate. This change would require commissioners to hold a referendum and voters to support it.</p>\n\n<p>There also is a debate about changing the size of the City Commission <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article276139891.html\">from five to seven or nine commissioners</a>. Higgins <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/eileen-higgins-wins-miami-mayoral-runoff-breaking-30-year-democratic-drought/\">supported this idea</a>, noting that other Florida cities the size of Miami have larger commissions. This charter change would also <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/government-politics/2025-04-30/expand-miami-city-commission-change-elections\">require voter approval</a>, but needs the commission to act or for citizens to initiate the process. The mayor’s role would be to advocate for the need for greater representation of neighborhoods and government responsiveness.</p>\n\n<h2>Immigration enforcement</h2>\n\n<p>In a city where nearly 60% of the population is foreign-born, <a href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/769200-did-immigration-turn-miami-blue/\">immigration issues</a> loom large.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2025, after a contentious meeting, the commission voted 3-2 <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/news-in-brief/2025-09-03/miami-police-collaborate-ice-despite-state-law-clarification\">to approve a 287(g) agreement</a> with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to aid Trump’s enforcement measures.</p>\n\n<p>While Higgins cannot remove the city from the agreement, she plans to <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article313559686.html\">minimize Miami’s involvement</a> with immigration enforcement. “There’s no reason in the city of Miami that our police department should be in the job of federal immigration enforcement,” she told the press.</p>\n\n<h2>City finances</h2>\n\n<p>Municipal budgets have been squeezed <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/government-politics/2025-10-23/florida-cfo-blaise-ingoglia-torches-miamis-wasteful-spending-calls-for-property-tax-relief\">by state policies and state Department of Government Efficiency efforts</a>. Recent federal cuts to social service and transportation grants <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article311666698.html\">have exacerbated the problem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, state leaders are proposing to <a href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/761007-house-files-sweeping-property-tax-cuts-package-for-voters-not-lawmakers-to-approve-or-reject/\">eliminate property taxes</a> in 2026, further straining local coffers. Public spending will need to be reduced, or revenues replaced. The mayor makes budget proposals, but it is commissioners who approve them. Higgins will need to lead through persuasion and clear explanations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269480/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sean Foreman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They are not cynics; they just ask themselves and each other a lot of questions.</p>\n\n<p>If they see a claim that a finding is true, they will ask: “Why?” They may hypothesize that if that finding is true, then some related findings must also be true. If it’s unclear whether one or more of those other findings is true, they will do more work to find out.</p>\n\n<p>It is no wonder that science moves so slowly, especially on really important topics such as climate change.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordshake.com/definition/dogmatism\">Dogmatism is the opposite</a> of skepticism. It is the proclivity to assert opinions as unequivocally true without taking account of contrary evidence or the contradictory findings. It is why public debate over scientific findings never seems to go away.</p>\n\n<p>An example of the difference is the reaction to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s finding in 1995 that “<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_sar_wg_I_full_report.pdf\">evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate</a>.” The IPCC’s assessment reports involve hundreds of researchers from around the world who reviewed the global scientific understanding of the planet’s changing climate.</p>\n\n<p>It’s an instructive case in the differences between skepticism and dogmatism, and it’s something to think about as you hear people talk about climate change.</p>\n\n<h2>Origins of a dogmatic response</h2>\n\n<p>Shortly after the IPCC released that finding in 1995, persistent and well-organized attacks on the science began. Many came from <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/kochland-examines-how-the-koch-brothers-made-their-fortune-and-the-influence-it-bought\">groups supported by the owners of Koch Industries</a>, a conglomerate involved in oil refining and chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>Their strategies mimicked earlier assaults on science and scientists who had warned the public that smoking posed a serious threat to their health. This time it was a warning about fossil fuels’ impact on the climate.</p>\n\n<p>The similarity should not be a surprise. Science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, in their 2011 book “<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/merchants-of-doubt-9781608193943/\">Merchants of Doubt</a>,” and American historian Nancy MacLean, in her <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533763/democracy-in-chains-by-nancy-maclean/\">2010 book “Democracy in Chains</a>,” have explained how the strategy was written by some of the same people who had tried to stop efforts to tighten tobacco regulations a decade or so earlier.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/merchants-of-doubt-9781608193943/\">dogma presented to the public</a> for fighting regulation held that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/may/29/freedom-and-liberty-should-not-be-red-flags-for-climate-science-denial-but-they-are\">personal freedoms</a> are paramount and that they are not to be diminished by any efforts designed explicitly to improve the general welfare.</p>\n\n<h2>What a skeptical response looks like</h2>\n\n<p>Climate scientists understood in 1995 that they must provide more than laboratory results, which go back to <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius\">Svante Arrhenius’ work in 1895</a> demonstrating a causal correlation between increasing carbon dioxide concentrations and rising temperatures.</p>\n\n<p>They also accepted the challenge of exploring collections of associated effects that should also be true if human activity was changing the climate.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists have since examined dozens of different independently monitored aspects of climate change and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/567678-how-ipcc-went-from-not-proven-that-we-cause-climate-change-in-1990/\">confirmed the expected fingerprints of climate change</a> all <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/5-forecasts-early-climate-models-got-right-the-evidence-is-all-around-you-263248\">around the world</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the upper layers of the oceans absorb 90% of the atmosphere’s excess heat, they should be persistently warming as global temperatures rise. Has that happened? <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content\">Yes, it has</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"YDYiX\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YDYiX/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Since land-based ice melts when temperatures get too warm, global sea level should rise. And it should rise by more than would happen with thermal expansion of warming ocean water alone. Is it? <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">Data shows that it is</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A line chart showing meltwater as the top contributor, followed by thermal expansion\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=314&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=314&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=314&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707220/original/file-20251208-66-dr1gjx.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The major contributors to sea level rise.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.climate.gov/media/12868\">NOAA Climate.gov</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald argued in 1967 that the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/11/manabe-lecture.pdf\">upper atmosphere should cool</a> while surface temperatures rise in response to higher carbon dioxide concentrations.

Combining the evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based on single variables. Large-scale indicators of climate change in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and at the land surface show clear responses to human influence consistent with those expected based on model simulations and physical understanding.”</p>\n\n<h2>Convincing the public</h2>\n\n<p>But has the public been convinced? The data on this is mixed.</p>\n\n<p>Annual surveys conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication have found that <a href=\"https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/about/projects/global-warmings-six-americas/\">the percentage of Americans</a> “alarmed” about climate change rose over the past 11 years – from 15% in 2014 to 26% in 2024. And they show that much of that increase came from an increase in concern among Americans who earlier considered themselves “concerned” or “cautious.”</p>\n\n<p>Over the same time period, though, the proportion of citizens in the survey who considered themselves “disengaged,” “doubtful” or “dismissive” shrank only modestly, from 29% to 27%.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"r7hzT\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r7hzT/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Other surveys suggest <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/05/29/americans-views-on-how-to-address-the-impacts-of-extreme-weather/\">that personal experience</a> likely plays a significant role in how people understand climate change.</p>\n\n<p>Many local and national news stations have mentioned climate change as a contributing factor in their extensive coverage of destructive <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-santa-ana-winds-fueled-the-deadly-fires-in-southern-california-246965\">wildfires in Los Angeles</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/after-maui-fires-human-health-risks-linger-in-the-air-water-and-even-surviving-buildings-211404\">Hawaii</a>, flash floods <a href=\"https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/news/environment/2025/09/24/climate-change-impacts-when-where-intense-weather-events-like-helene-will-strike/86115917007/\">in North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/09/texas-hill-country-floods-kerrville-climate-change/\">Texas</a>, persistent <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2025/10/11/human-emissions-are-helping-fuel/\">drought across the Southwest</a>, extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions\">heat waves</a> and destructive hurricanes. </p>\n\n<p>Some of their viewers could certainly be coming around to believing <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/climate-change1/\">what evidence shows</a>: that climate-related disasters have become <a href=\"https://climatecafe.substack.com/p/the-climate-is-changing-show-me-the-576\">more frequent and more intense</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"AdyQX\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AdyQX/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Americans are also directly experiencing other effects of climate change on their homes, health and wallets. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Doctors in the North are seeing increasing cases of <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/articles/2025/tick-borne-diseases-risk-increase/\">Lyme disease</a>. Those in the South have been witnessing a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/stories/dengue-on-the-rise-get-the-facts.html\">rising number of cases of dengue fever</a>. Both are spread by insects whose ranges are expanding as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">temperatures rise</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lobster populations have <a href=\"https://lispartnership.org/ecosystem-target-indicators/lobster-abundance/\">collapsed in Long Island Sound</a> and flourished farther north in Canada’s Bay of Fundy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Residents in southern New England now enjoy feeding <a href=\"https://www.massaudubon.org/nature-wildlife/birds/eastern-bluebirds\">bluebirds in winter</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Homeowners across the U.S. are seeing their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-home-insurance-rates-are-rising-fast-across-the-us-climate-change-plays-a-big-role-238939\">property insurance premiums</a> quickly rise as disaster risks increase. Many others can’t get coverage from insurance companies at all because of their area’s disaster risks.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stories like these do not make the national news very often, but they do show up in conversations around the kitchen table.</p>\n\n<h2>Reaching those with dismissive views</h2>\n\n<p>So, how can those Americans who are dismissive of climate change be reached? Some dogmatically believe claims that “climate change is a hoax” despite <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/climate-change1/\">ever-growing evidence to the contrary</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Talking about personal experiences with extreme weather events, wildfires or droughts and their connections to rising global temperatures can help.</p>\n\n<p>It might also help to remind them of failed dogma from the past that was disproved by science, yet people continued for years to believe them. For example, we know today that the Earth is not flat, the Sun does not circle the Earth, and living organisms cannot materialize spontaneously from nonliving matter.</p>\n\n<p>The shift in public perceptions of climate risks leaves me hopeful that more people are acknowledging the scientific understanding of climate change and catching up with the climate scientists who have produced, questioned, reexamined and reaffirmed their findings through rigorous application of the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/the-scientific-method-and-climate-change-how-scientists-know/\">scientific method</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271516/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gary W.

But many people have trouble unwinding at this time of year. Why do the December holidays offer the promise of respite but never seem to deliver? And is more restorative rest possible during this busy season?</p>\n\n<p>I am <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DKC3WV8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a psychologist</a> who studies how rest supports learning, creativity and well-being. Sleep is often the first thing that many people associate with rest, but humans also require restorative downtime when awake. These active rest periods include physical, social and creative experiences that can occur throughout the day – not just while mindlessly scrolling on the couch. </p>\n\n<p>When holiday stresses begin to snowball, rest periods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/prp.2013.6\">replenish depleted psychological resources</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14927713.1999.9651258\">reduce stress</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/04419057.2007.9674499\">promote well-being</a>. But reaping the full benefits of rest and leisure requires more than a slow morning or a mug of hot cocoa. It’s also about intentionally scheduling active recovery periods that energize us and leave us feeling restored. </p>\n\n<p>That’s because good rest needs to be anticipated, planned and refined.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"pcyyY\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pcyyY/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Holiday stress</h2>\n\n<p>The winter holiday season can take a toll on well-being. <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2023/11/holiday-season-stress\">Financial stress increases</a>, and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12479442/\">daily routines are disrupted</a>. Add the stress of travel, plus a dash of challenging family dynamics, and it’s not surprising that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-015-9441-8\">emotional well-being declines</a> during the holiday season. </p>\n\n<p>Quality rest and leisure periods can buffer these stressors, promoting <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2015-01003-001\">recovery and well-being</a>. They also can help <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411434979\">reduce psychological strain</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02678373.2018.1427816\">prolong positive emotions</a> as people return to work. </p>\n\n<p>Effective rest comes in many forms, from going outdoors for a walk to socializing, listening to music or engaging in creative hobbies. These activities may feel like distractions, but they serve important mental health functions.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, research finds that walking in nature results in diminished activation in the area of the brain associated with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1510459112\">sadness and ruminating thoughts</a>. Walks in nature are also associated with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-023-05112-z\">reduced anxiety and stress</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other studies have shown that activities such as playing the piano or doing calligraphy <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0255761411408505\">significantly lower cortisol</a>, a stress hormone. In fact, some of the most promising interventions for depression involve <a href=\"https://www.guilford.com/books/Behavioral-Activation-for-Depression/Martell-Dimidjian-Herman-Dunn/9781462548385\">participation in pleasant leisure activities</a>. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Not all idle time is restorative</h2>\n\n<p>So why does it feel so hard to get good rest during the holidays?</p>\n\n<p>One of the most robust findings from psychologists and researchers who study leisure is that the effectiveness of rest periods depends on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038508\">how satisfying they feel to the individual</a>. This might sound obvious, but people often spend their free time doing things that are not satisfying. </p>\n\n<p>For example, a famous 2002 study of how people spent their time found that the most popular form of leisure was <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11531116_Television_Addiction_is_no_mere_metaphor\">watching television</a>. But participants also rated TV time as their least enjoyable activity. Those who watched more than four hours of TV a day rated it as even less enjoyable than those who watched less than two hours a day. </p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, my colleagues and I collected data from college students and found that students reported <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/38wq6_v1\">turning to mindless distractions</a>, such as social media, at the end of the day, but that it usually did not leave them feeling reenergized or restored.

A large body of research shows that designing, scheduling and engaging in enjoyable activities is effective at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2006.11.001\">lowering symptoms of depression</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1016/j.xjmad.2023.100004\">and anxiety</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For the holiday season, this might mean following an afternoon of shopping with a recovery period reading a book in a quiet place, or going for a walk after opening gifts instead of immediately shifting into cleaning mode. By following a schedule, not a mood, research suggests that people can <a href=\"https://www.guilford.com/books/Behavioral-Activation-for-Depression/Martell-Dimidjian-Herman-Dunn/9781462548385\">break cycles of poor rest and inactivity</a> and achieve greater recovery and well-being.</p>\n\n<h2>Wrestling with guilt</h2>\n\n<p>Even with perfectly planned and executed rest periods, guilt can loom. Leisure guilt is a psychological construct that encompasses feelings of distress about spending time doing things that are relaxing rather than productive. It can <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2853951435?fromopenview=true&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses\">reduce enjoyment of leisure</a>, undercutting one of the mechanisms that link rest with well-being. </p>\n\n<p>During the holidays, this problem may become even more pronounced. The season brings <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15598276251381626\">changes to daily routines</a>, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.046\">daylight levels and temperature</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2085136\">diets</a>. All of these shifts can deplete people’s energy levels. High expectations during the holidays may make guilt an even bigger threat to rest.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer to poor-quality rest cycles is planned active rest periods, then what is the solution to feelings of guilt?</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Lower expectations, immersive rest and acceptance</h2>\n\n<p>Research on leisure guilt is in its infancy, but my own struggles have shown me a few ways to resist the pressure to be productive every spare minute. Here are some tips to fight back against the flawed belief that rest is just laziness in disguise, during the holidays and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>First, I work to convince myself and my family members to lower expectations for our seasonal activities. Not every baked cookie needs to be individually frosted and decorated, and not every gift has to be wrapped with a perfect bow. By agreeing to lower our expectations, we eliminate extraneous work and the guilt of feeling that there is more to be done.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Cookies decorated with crooked dabs of frosting and candies\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709240/original/file-20251216-62-1fo4j5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Festive doesn’t have to mean perfect.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/gingerbread-men-biscuits-royalty-free-image/876089496\">Sally Anscombe/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Second, I’ve found that restful activities that provide a strong feeling of immersion – playing video games, going for walks and playing with my young nieces and nephews – are a lot more restorative than scrolling on my phone or watching TV on the couch. These diversions require my full attention and prevent me from thinking about things such as my overflowing email inbox or unfinished household chores.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when I do experience leisure guilt, I accept the feeling and try to move on. During high-stress situations, accepting negative emotions rather than avoiding them can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2010.05.025\">reduce depressive symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Humans need restorative periods of downtime during the holidays and beyond, but this does not always come easily or naturally to everyone. Through small adjustments and intentional actions, good rest can be within reach this holiday season.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270396/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stacy Shaw does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Microsoft Outlook calendars by default shade those hours with a different color than the rest of the day.</p>\n\n<p>This schedule didn’t always reign supreme.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929-1941, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/labor-activism-40-hour-work-week-edcd8305\">6-day workweeks were the norm</a>. In most industries, U.S. workers got Sundays off so they could go to church. Eventually, it became customary for employees to get <a href=\"https://rethinkq.adp.com/history-of-the-weekend/\">half of Saturday off</a> too.</p>\n\n<p>Legislation that President <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938\">Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law</a> as part of his sweeping New Deal reforms helped establish the 40-hour workweek as we know it today. Labor unions had <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/labor-day-and-may-day-emerged-from-the-movement-for-a-shorter-workday-in-industrial-america-262379\">long advocated for this abridged schedule</a>, and their activism helped crystallize it across diverse occupations.</p>\n\n<p>Despite many changes in technology as well as when and how work gets done, these hours have had a <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/emp-by-ftpt-job-edu-h.htm\">surprising amount of staying power</a>.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Americans work longer hours</h2>\n\n<p>In general, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-vs-gdp-per-capita-pwt?time=2019..latest\">workers in richer countries tend to work fewer hours</a>. However, in the U.S. today, people <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/hours-worked.html\">work more on average</a> than in most other wealthy countries.</p>\n\n<p>For many Americans, this is not so much a choice as it is part of an entrenched working culture.</p>\n\n<p>There are many factors that can interfere with thriving at work, including boredom, an abusive boss or an absence of meaning and purpose. In any of those cases, it’s worth asking whether the time spent at work is worth it. Only <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx\">1 in 3 employed Americans</a> say that they are thriving.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, employee engagement is <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/654911/employee-engagement-sinks-year-low.aspx\">at a 10-year low</a>. For both engaged and disengaged employees, <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/658235/why-americans-working-less.aspx\">burnout increased</a> as the number of work hours rose. People who were working more than 45 hours per week were at greatest risk for burnout, according to Gallup.</p>\n\n<p>However, the average number of hours Americans spend working has <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/658235/why-americans-working-less.aspx\">declined from 44 hours and 6 minutes in 2019</a> to just under 43 hours per week in 2024. The reduction is sharper for younger employees.</p>\n\n<p>We think this could be a sign that younger Americans are pushing back after years of being pressured to embrace a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html\">hustle culture</a>” in which <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/busy-bragging-workplace-trend-employees-rethinking-office-behavior-doesnt-impress-people\">people brag about working</a> 80 and even 100 hours per week.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAxlGIN4mu8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Critiques of ‘hustle culture’ are becoming more common.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fight against a pervasive notion</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://slaughter.scholar.princeton.edu/biocv\">Anne-Marie Slaughter</a>, a lawyer and political scientist who wears many hats, coined the term “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\">time macho</a>” more than a decade ago to convey the notion that someone who puts in longer hours at the office automatically will outperform their colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>Another term, “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726709353139\">face time</a>,” describes the time that we are seen by others doing our work. In some workplaces, the quantity of an employee’s face time is treated as a measure of whether they are dependable – or uncommitted.</p>\n\n<p>It can be easy to jump to the conclusion that putting in more hours at the office automatically boosts an employee’s performance. However, researchers have found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2017.03.006\">productivity decreases with the number of hours worked</a> <a href=\"https://mirsham.org.il/uploads/n/1557044764.4498.pdf\">due to fatigue</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even those with the luxury to choose how much time they devote to work sometimes presume that they need to clock as many hours as possible to demonstrate their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726709353139\">commitment to their jobs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, for a significant amount of the workforce, there is no choice about how much to work because that <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/18/whats-wrong-with-the-way-we-work\">time is dictated, whether by employers</a>, the needs of the job or the growing necessity to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/california-backyard-housing-rent-storage-unit.html?\">work multiple jobs to make ends meet</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>4-day workweek experiments</h2>\n\n<p>One way to shave hours off the workweek is to get more days off.</p>\n\n<p>A multinational working group has examined experiments with a <a href=\"https://www.4dayweek.com/\">four-day workweek</a>: an arrangement in which people work 80% of the time – 32 hours over four days – while getting paid the same as when they worked a standard 40-hour week. Following an initial pilot in the U.S. and Ireland in 2022, the working group has expanded to six continents. The researchers <a href=\"https://www.4dayweek.com/research\">consistently found</a> that employers and employees alike thrive in this setup and that their work didn’t suffer.</p>\n\n<p>Most of those employees, who ranged from government workers to technology professionals, got Friday off. Shifting to having a three-day weekend meant that employees had more time to take care of themselves and their families. Productivity and performance metrics remained high.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"This picture depicts a 4-day workweek.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708929/original/file-20251215-56-gl87xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some studies examining four-day workweek experiments have had promising results.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/2232888662\">Andrzej Rostek/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Waiting for technology to take a load off</h2>\n\n<p>Many employment experts wonder whether advances in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13787\">artificial intelligence will reduce the number of hours</a> that Americans work.</p>\n\n<p>Might AI relieve us all of the tasks we dread doing, leaving us only with the work we want to do – and which, presumably, would be worth spending time on?

That means work becomes more stressful and expectations regarding productivity rise.</p>\n\n<h2>Deciding when and how much time to work</h2>\n\n<p>Many adults spend <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t08b.htm\">so much time working</a> that they have few waking hours left for fitness, relationships, new hobbies or anything else.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a choice in the matter of when and how much you work, should you choose differently?</p>\n\n<p>Even questioning whether you should stick to the 40-hour workweek is a luxury, but it’s well worth considering changing your work routines as a new year gets underway if that’s a possibility for you. To get buy-in from employers, consider demonstrating how you will still deliver your core work within your desired time frame.</p>\n\n<p>And, if you are fortunate enough to be able to choose to work less or work differently, perhaps you can pass it on: You probably have the power and privilege to influence the working hours of others you employ or supervise.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270766/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Despite the fact that warning labels on cigarettes have <a href=\"https://record.umich.edu/articles/millions-lives-saved-surgeon-generals-tobacco-warning-50-years-ago/\">saved millions of lives</a>, the tobacco industry fought tooth and nail <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/cigarette-warning-labels-smoking\">against them to keep consumers in the dark</a>.

This doctrine prohibits the government from forcing people to make ideological statements they don’t actually believe, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/319us624\">such as reciting the Pledge of Allegiance</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxHJ9_oyUIw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A 9News report on the lawsuit against Colorado’s new law.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf\">National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court greatly expanded this rule and opened the door for challenges to government efforts to require businesses to disclose truthful statements of fact. The court held that the government cannot compel businesses to disclose factual information if it is “controversial.” </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it would be hard to find a manufacturer who does not think such disclosures are controversial, given that businesses are likely to disagree that their products are dangerous. If a subjective claim that a disclosure is controversial is all it takes to strike a law down, many such laws are vulnerable to legal attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Interest groups representing the tobacco industry, the gas industry and others <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11453&amp;context=ilj\">have seized on this opportunity</a> to dismantle what most people understand to be routine labeling requirements. For example, companies have filed lawsuits challenging federal laws <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/13-5252/13-5252-2014-04-14.html\">requiring companies to disclose that they use “conflict minerals”</a> and local laws requiring beverage manufacturers to disclose that drinking sugar-sweetened drinks “<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/16-16072/16-16072-2019-01-31.html\">contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>In its lawsuit, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, a trade association that <a href=\"https://www.aham.org/AHAM/What_We_Do/Advocacy.aspx\">lobbies on behalf of the home appliance industry</a>, argues that Colorado’s law compels gas stove manufacturers to place warning labels on their products that it believes contain “<a href=\"https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/US_DIS_COD_1_25cv2417_d58264304e540_Emergency_MOTION_for_Temporary_Restraining_Order_a.pdf\">scientifically controversial and factually misleading</a>” information around gas stoves. </p>\n\n<p>However, abundant evidence shows that cooking with a gas stove releases pollutants that harm human health. Multiple <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c09289\">studies have shown that burning</a> methane gas produces <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorado-is-tackling-air-pollution-in-vulnerable-neighborhoods-by-regulating-5-air-toxics-248520\">nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and benzene</a> that can worsen respiratory illnesses such as asthma and increase the risk of cancer. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A young child wears a mask connected to a white tube over their face.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709221/original/file-20251216-72-mrctpk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cooking with gas stoves indoors has been linked to human health harms such as asthma.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/natalie-cole-has-been-battling-poverty-her-whole-life-aside-news-photo/566027183?adppopup=true\">Michael Robinson Chavez/GettyImages</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Furthermore, in 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a22-refcmte-d-report-annotated.pdf\">American Medical Association recognized</a> that gas stove use can increase household air pollution, the risk of childhood asthma and asthma severity. The same year, the <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/policy-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-briefs/policy-database/2023/01/18/gas-stove-emissions\">American Public Health Association recommended</a> putting warning labels on gas stoves as an official policy position. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/Cooking-With-Smoke.pdf\">Public health advocates contend</a> that the gas industry <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-science-showed-in-the-1970s-that-gas-stoves-produced-harmful-indoor-air-pollution-the-industry-reached-for-tobaccos-pr-playbook-216698\">has known about the health harms of gas stoves for decades</a>, but that the industry has repeatedly attempted to paint its products in a better light. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/climate/gas-stove-health.html\">A 2023 expose by The New York Times</a>, for example, revealed that the gas industry paid toxicologist Julie Goodman to downplay the health impacts of gas stoves. Just eight years earlier, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/climate/gas-stove-health.html\">Goodman provided testimony</a> on behalf of tobacco companies. A judge described her testimony on tobacco as “contrary to consensus of the scientific community.”</p>\n\n<h2>Risk to consumers</h2>\n\n<p>If the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers’ claim succeeds in court, it could, in my analysis, make it much easier for companies to fund biased research or bring in experts to argue that something is not well-established science.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a drug manufacturer could hire an expert to dispute the side effects of a drug. Food producers might claim their experts disagree with the science underlying nutrition and calorie information required by government regulation. Even manufacturers of everyday items such as lawnmowers or toasters could hire experts and proclaim that their products pose no safety harms. </p>\n\n<p>Everyday people would bear the brunt of harm from the invalidation of warning label laws. These people currently have the right to know critical health and safety information before buying any product. If we let corporate interests undermine regulations such as warning labels, I believe we will no longer be able to inform the public about commonsense steps they can take to protect their health. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/local\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271370/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alan K.

Can they fill the same ecological role that wolves used to? These are the questions I set out to answer in my paper published in August 2025 in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.60102/stacks-25011\">Stacks Journal</a>. I focused on their role as predators – what they eat and how often they kill big herbivores, such as deer and moose.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s on the menu?</h2>\n\n<p>I started by reviewing every paper I could find on wolf or coyote diets, recording what percent of scat or stomach samples contained common food items such as deer, rabbits, small rodents or fruit. I compared northeastern wolf diets to northeastern coyote diets and red wolf diets to southeastern coyote diets.</p>\n\n<p>I found two striking differences between wolf and coyote diets. First, wolves ate more medium-sized herbivores. In particular, they ate more beavers in the northeast and more nutria in the southeast. Both of these species are large aquatic rodents that influence ecosystems – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/wat2.1494\">beaver dam building changes how water moves</a>, sometimes undesirably for land owners, while nutria are non-native and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.22120/jwb.2019.109875.1074\">damaging to wetlands</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, wolves have narrower diets overall. They eat less fruit and fewer omnivores such as birds, raccoons and foxes, compared to coyotes. This means that coyotes are likely performing some ecological roles that wolves never did, such as dispersing fruit seeds in their poop and suppressing populations of smaller predators.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram showing the diets of wolves and coyotes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=384&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=384&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=384&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706548/original/file-20251204-56-dt7fwb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Grouping food items by size and trophic level revealed some clear differences between wolf and coyote diets.

So I also reviewed every study I could find on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/ungulate\">ungulate</a> mortality – these are studies that tag deer or moose, track their survival, and attribute a cause of death if they die.</p>\n\n<p>These studies revealed other important differences between wolves and coyotes. For example, wolves were responsible for a substantial percentage of moose deaths – 19% of adults and 40% of calves – while none of the studies documented coyotes killing moose. This means that all, or nearly all, of moose in coyote diets is scavenged.</p>\n\n<p>Coyotes are adept predators of deer, however. In the northeast, they killed more white-tailed deer fawns than wolves did, 28% compared to 15%, and a similar percentage of adult deer, 18% compared to 22%. In the southeast, coyotes killed 40% of fawns but only 6% of adults.</p>\n\n<p>Rarely killing adult deer in the southeast could have implications for other members of the <a href=\"https://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/naturalcommunities.aspx\">ecological community</a>. For example, after killing an adult ungulate, many large predators leave some of the carcass behind, which can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13489\">an important source of food for scavengers</a>. Although there is no data on how often red wolves kill adult deer, it is likely that coyotes are not supplying food to scavengers to the same extent that red wolves do.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708254/original/file-20251211-56-37i9ci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two wolves walking through the grass.

It means that although coyotes eat some of the same foods, they cannot fully replace wolves. Differences between wolves and coyotes were particularly pronounced in the northeast, where coyotes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1499\">rarely killed moose</a> or beavers. Coyotes in the southeast were more similar to red wolves, but coyotes likely killed fewer nutria and adult deer. </p>\n\n<p>The return of wolves could be a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023251118\">natural solution</a> for regions where wildlife managers desire a reduction in moose, beaver, nutria or deer populations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even with the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/after-an-80-year-absence-gray-wolves-have-returned-to-colorado-heres-how-the-reintroduction-of-this-apex-predator-will-affect-prey-and-plants-220210\">aid of reintroductions</a>, wolves will likely never fully recover their former range in eastern North America – there are too many people. Coyotes, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coyotes-are-here-to-stay-in-north-american-cities-heres-how-to-appreciate-them-from-a-distance-186893\">do quite well around people</a>. So even if wolves never fully recover, at least coyotes will be in those places partially filling the role that wolves once had.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, humans have changed the world so much that it <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/q-and-a-the-rambunctious-garden/\">may be impossible to return</a> to the way things were before people substantially changed the planet.

Teachers want to know whether students’ work reflects their own understanding; consumers want to know whether an advertisement was written by a human or a machine.</p>\n\n<p>Writing rules to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-label-ai-ads-deepfake-6df668ae93489da7d448c66e53905bbb\">govern the use of AI-generated content</a> is relatively easy. Enforcing them depends on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-ai-detectors\">something much harder</a>: reliably detecting whether a piece of text was generated by artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Some studies have investigated whether humans can detect AI-generated text. For example, people who themselves use AI writing tools heavily have been shown to accurately detect AI-written text. A panel of human evaluators can even outperform automated tools in a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-long.267\">controlled setting</a>. However, such expertise is not widespread, and individual judgment can be inconsistent. Institutions that need consistency at a large scale therefore turn to automated AI text detectors.</p>\n\n<h2>The problem of AI text detection</h2>\n\n<p>The basic workflow behind AI text detection is easy to describe. Start with a piece of text whose origin you want to determine. Then apply a detection tool, often an AI system itself, that analyzes the text and produces a score, usually expressed as a probability, indicating how likely the text is to have been AI-generated. Use the score to inform downstream decisions, such as whether to impose a penalty for violating a rule.</p>\n\n<p>This simple description, however, hides a great deal of complexity. It glosses over a number of background assumptions that need to be made explicit. Do you know which AI tools might have plausibly been used to generate the text? What kind of access do you have to these tools? Can you run them yourself, or inspect their inner workings? How much text do you have? Do you have a single text or a collection of writings gathered over time? What AI detection tools can and cannot tell you depends critically on the answers to questions like these.</p>\n\n<p>There is one additional detail that is especially important: Did the AI system that generated the text deliberately embed markers to make later detection easier? </p>\n\n<p>These indicators are known as watermarks. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08025-4\">Watermarked text</a> looks like ordinary text, but the markers are embedded in subtle ways that do not reveal themselves to casual inspection. Someone with the right key can later check for the presence of these markers and verify that the text came from a watermarked AI-generated source. This approach, however, relies on cooperation from AI vendors and is not always available.</p>\n\n<h2>How AI text detection tools work</h2>\n\n<p>One obvious approach is to use AI itself to detect AI-written text. The idea is straightforward. Start by collecting a large corpus, meaning collection of writing, of examples labeled as human-written or AI-generated, then train a model to distinguish between the two. In effect, AI text detection is treated as a standard classification problem, similar in spirit to spam filtering. Once trained, the detector examines new text and predicts whether it more closely resembles the AI-generated examples or the human-written ones it has seen before.</p>\n\n<p>The learned-detector approach can work even if you know little about which AI tools might have generated the text. The main requirement is that the training corpus be diverse enough to include outputs from a wide range of AI systems. </p>\n\n<p>But if you do have access to the AI tools you are concerned about, a different approach becomes possible. This second strategy does not rely on collecting large labeled datasets or training a separate detector. Instead, it looks for statistical signals in the text, often in relation to how specific AI models generate language, to assess whether the text is likely to be AI-generated. For example, some methods examine the probability that an AI model assigns to a piece of text. If the model assigns an unusually high probability to the exact sequence of words, this can be a signal that the text was, in fact, generated by that model.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the case of text that is generated by an AI system that embeds a watermark, the problem shifts from detection to verification. Using a secret key provided by the AI vendor, a verification tool can assess whether the text is consistent with having been generated by a watermarked system. This approach relies on information that is not available from the text alone, rather than on inferences drawn from the text itself.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUgfQAaRL6Y?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">AI engineer Tom Dekan demonstrates how easily commercial AI text detectors can be defeated.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Limitations of detection tools</h2>\n\n<p>Each family of tools comes with <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2025.genaidetect-1.4/\">its own limitations</a>, making it difficult to declare a clear winner. Learning-based detectors, for example, are sensitive to how closely new text resembles the data they were trained on. Their accuracy drops when the text differs substantially from the training corpus, which can quickly become outdated as new AI models are released. Continually curating fresh data and retraining detectors is costly, and detectors inevitably lag behind the systems they are meant to identify.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical tests face a different set of constraints. Many rely on assumptions about how specific AI models generate text, or on access to those models’ probability distributions. When models are proprietary, frequently updated or simply unknown, these assumptions break down. As a result, methods that work well in controlled settings can become unreliable or inapplicable in the real world.</p>\n\n<p>Watermarking shifts the problem from detection to verification, but it introduces its own dependencies. It relies on cooperation from AI vendors and applies only to text generated with watermarking enabled.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, AI text detection is part of an escalating arms race. Detection tools must be publicly available to be useful, but that same transparency enables evasion. As AI text generators grow more capable and evasion techniques more sophisticated, detectors are unlikely to gain a lasting upper hand.</p>\n\n<h2>Hard reality</h2>\n\n<p>The problem of AI text detection is simple to state but hard to solve reliably. Institutions with rules governing the use of AI-written text cannot rely on detection tools alone for enforcement. </p>\n\n<p>As society adapts to generative AI, we are likely to refine norms around acceptable use of AI-generated text and improve detection techniques. But ultimately, we’ll have to learn to live with the fact that such tools will never be perfect.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265181/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ambuj Tewari receives funding from NSF and NIH. </span></em></p>",

Schools have many options, from traditional metal detectors and cameras to gunshot detection systems and weaponized drones. There are also purveyors of artificial-intelligence-assisted surveillance systems that <a href=\"https://www.omnilert.com/solutions/gun-detection-system\">promise prevention</a>: The gun will be detected before any shots are fired, and the shooting will never happen. </p>\n\n<p>They appeal to institutions struggling to protect their communities, and are marketed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-and-campus-safety-industry/\">aggressively</a> as the future of school shooting prevention.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily-Greene-Colozzi\">criminologist</a> who studies mass shootings and school violence. In my research, I’ve found that there’s a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of these technological interventions.</p>\n\n<h2>Grasping for a solution</h2>\n\n<p>Implementation has not lagged. A survey from Campus Safety Magazine <a href=\"https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/insights/weapons-detection-survey-finds-many-campuses-adopting-screening-technologies/158649/\">found that</a> about 24% of K-12 schools report video-assisted weapons detection systems, and 14% use gunshot detection systems, like <a href=\"https://www.soundthinking.com/law-enforcement/leading-gunshot-detection-system/\">ShotSpotter</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Gunshot detection uses acoustic sensors placed within an area to detect gunfire and alert police. Research has shown that gunshot detection may help police <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-025-00259-5\">respond faster</a> to gun crimes, but it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-021-00515-4\">has little</a> to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12648\">no role</a> in preventing gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>Still, schools may be warming to the idea of gunshot detection to address the threat of a campus shooter. In 2022, the school board in Manchester, New Hampshire, <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/manchester-schools-to-deploy-police-surveillance-tech\">voted to implement ShotSpotter</a> in the district’s schools after a series of active-shooter threats.</p>\n\n<p>Other companies claim their technologies provide real-time visual weapons detection. <a href=\"https://evolv.com/concealed-weapons-detection/\">Evolv</a> is an AI screening system for detecting concealed weapons, which has been implemented in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tech-education/feature-can-tech-protect-us-schools-from-mass-shootings-idUKL8N3789I5/\">more than 400 school buildings</a> since 2021. <a href=\"https://zeroeyes.com/\">ZeroEyes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.omnilert.com/solutions/gun-detection-system\">Omnilert</a> are AI-assisted security camera systems that detect firearms and promise to notify authorities within seconds or minutes of a gun being detected. </p>\n\n<p>These systems analyze surveillance video with AI programs trained to recognize a range of visual cues, including different types of guns and behavioral indicators of aggression. Upon recognizing a threat, the system notifies a human verification team, which can then activate a prescribed response plan.</p>\n\n<p>But even these highly sophisticated systems can fail to detect a real threat, leading to questions about the utility of security technology. Antioch High School in Nashville, Tennessee, was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/us/ai-gun-detection-software-antioch-school\">equipped with Omnilert’s gun detection technology</a> in January 2025 when a student walked inside the school building with a gun and shot several classmates, one fatally, before killing himself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"cameras mounted on a ceiling painted green\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709559/original/file-20251217-56-jscybb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">School security technology firm ZeroEyes uses this greenscreen lab to test and train artificial intelligence to spot visible guns.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/SchoolSafetyGuns/9ccdae8238e74aceafc3d2c20de08d29/photo\">AP Photo/Matt Slocum</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lack of evidence</h2>\n\n<p>This demonstrates an enduring problem with the school security technology industry: Most of these technologies are untested, and their effect on safety is unproven. Even gunshot detection systems have not been studied in the context of school and mass shootings outside of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825825\">simulation studies</a>. School shooting research has very little to offer in terms of assessing the value of these tools, because there are no studies out there. </p>\n\n<p>This lack is partly due to the low incidence of mass and school shootings. Even with a broad definition of school shootings – any gunfire on school grounds resulting in injury – the annual rate across America is approximately <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Overview-American-School-Shooting-Study-TASSS.pdf\">24 incidents per year</a>. That’s 24 more than anyone would want, but it’s a small sample size for research. And there are few, if any, ethically and empirically sound ways to test whether a campus fortified with ShotSpotter or the newest AI surveillance cameras is less likely to experience an active shooter incident because the probability of that school being victimized is already so low.</p>\n\n<p>Existing research provides a <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/250274.pdf\">useful overview</a> of the school safety technology landscape, but it offers little evidence of how well this technology actually prevents violence. The National Institute of Justice last published its <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/250274.pdf\">Comprehensive Report on School Safety Technology</a> in 2016, but its finding that the adoption of biometrics, “smart” cameras and weapons detection systems was outpacing research on the efficacy of the technology is still true today. The <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9922.html\">Rand Corporation</a> and the University of Michigan <a href=\"https://firearminjury.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Creating-Safe-Schools-1.pdf\">Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention</a> have produced similar findings that demonstrate limited or no evidence that these new technologies improve school safety and reduce risks. </p>\n\n<p>While researchers can study some aspects of how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41284-020-00281-z\">the environment</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37394\">and security</a> affect mass shooting outcomes, many of these technologies are too new to be included in studies, or too sparsely implemented to show any meaningful impact on outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>My research on active and mass shootings has suggested that the security features with the most lifesaving potential <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12686\">are not part of highly technical systems</a>: They are simple procedures like <a href=\"https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/can-school-lockdowns-save-lives-assessment-drills-and-use-real-world-events\">lockdowns</a> during shootings.</p>\n\n<h2>The tech keeps coming</h2>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, technological innovations continue to drive the school safety industry. Campus Guardian Angel, launched out of Texas in 2023, promises a rapid drone response to an active school shooter. Founder Justin Marston <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/texas-startup-proposes-new-defense-against-school-shooters-drones\">compared the drone system</a> to “having a SEAL team in the parking lot.” At $15,000 per box of six drones, and an additional monthly service charge per student, the drones are equipped with nonlethal weaponry, including flash-bangs and pepper spray guns.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2025, three Florida school districts <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2025/11/17/florida-launches-campus-guardian-angel-drones-in-volusia-county-schools-2-other-districts/\">announced their participation</a> in Campus Guardian Angel’s pilot programs.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7TN6-luT8M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Three school districts in Florida are part of a pilot program to test drones that respond to school shootings.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There is no shortage of proposed technologies. A presentation from the 2023 International Conference on Computer and Applications described <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA59364.2023.10401380\">a cutting-edge architectural design system</a> that integrates artificial intelligence and biometrics to bolster school security. And yet, the language used to describe the outcomes of this system leaned away from prevention, instead offering to “mitigate the potential” for a mass shooting to be carried out effectively.</p>\n\n<p>While the difference is subtle, prevention and mitigation reflect <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-415802-3.00010-5\">two different things</a>. Prevention is stopping something avoidable. Mitigation is consequence management: reducing the harm of an unavoidable hazard.</p>\n\n<h2>Response versus prevention</h2>\n\n<p>This is another of the enduring limitations of most emerging technologies being advertised as mass shooting prevention: They <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/school-shootings-dropped-in-2025-but-schools-are-still-focusing-too-much-on-safety-technology-instead-of-prevention-272140\">don’t prevent shootings</a>. They may streamline a response to a crisis and speed up the resolution of the incident. With most active shooter incidents <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/reports-and-publications/active-shooter-study-2000-2013-1.pdf/view\">lasting fewer than 10 minutes</a>, time saved could have critical lifesaving implications. </p>\n\n<p>But by the time ShotSpotter has detected gunshots on a college campus, or Campus Guardian Angel has been activated in the hallways of a high school, the window for preventing the shooting has long since passed.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272233/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Emily Greene-Colozzi receives funding from the National Institute of Justice. </span></em></p>",

Omandam likely bought the trunk secondhand in the Philippines or Hawaii. While the origins of the trunk remain a mystery, it traveled with Omandam from job to job, reflecting the life of a migrant worker continually on the move. Many of these trunks – Omandam’s included – contained handwritten correspondence written in beautiful cursive, photographs, postcards, work tools, garments and pay stubs. </p>\n\n<p>They were, in essence, time capsules of each of these men’s lives.</p>\n\n<h2>2.

Men donned these stylish garments to attend Sunday Mass, dinners and <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo8931658.html\">taxi-dance halls</a> – where they could pay a small fee to dance with a professional dancer – or merely to strut their stuff down the streets of Stockton’s Little Manila. </p>\n\n<p>Because Americans often looked down upon agricultural workers as uncultured and illiterate – “<a href=\"https://kitsapmuseum.org/filipino-american-pioneers/\">little brown monkeys</a>” was a common slur – Filipinos resisted these negative characterizations by presenting themselves like the Hollywood movie stars they saw at the cinema. They understood the power of self-presentation: By embracing popular American styles, they sought to command respect and dignity. </p>\n\n<p>They also wore these suits to pose for fancy photographs that were sent back home to the Philippines as a way to display affluence and social mobility – and to entice their compatriots to join them in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>Not everyone was enchanted. Some white Americans viewed these slick, handsomely dressed Filipino men as a sexual threat <a href=\"https://kitsapmuseum.org/filipino-american-pioneers/\">that could “steal” their women</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>4.

Lee</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Her Filipino father was a cook who served food to Filipino and Mexican field hands on farms throughout California’s Central Valley, where he later met Nambatac’s Mexican mother. </p>\n\n<p>In the 19th century and into the 20th century, <a href=\"https://americancommunitymedia.org/mixed-race/in-california-a-long-and-pivotal-history-of-interracial-marriage/\">California’s anti-miscegenation laws</a> prohibited whites from marrying outside their race. At the same time, the shared experiences of Mexican and Filipino farmworkers often led to relationships between members of the two migrant groups. </p>\n\n<p>When Barbara was 21, Nambatac’s father, who was a member of the Legionarios del Trabajo in Stockton, saved his modest salary to buy the dress from the Philippines and registered her in a beauty pageant that helped raise funds for the lodge. She ultimately took first place. </p>\n\n<p>In Stockton’s Little Manila, pageants reinforced the importance of women in the community. Since women were discouraged from migrating, there was a gender imbalance in Filipino American communities that persisted for decades. </p>\n\n<p>Filipinas who were able to migrate to the United States were important pillars in Stockton’s Filipino American community and assumed multiple roles. Women labored tirelessly alongside men in the fields, performed domestic work in households, advised young men to save money and go to school, and built and maintained networks that sustained local communities and transpacific ties back home in the Philippines. </p>\n\n<p>Although the gender disparity was stark in Little Manila before the 1960s, the presence of women and girls ensured the survival of Filipino American families. </p>\n\n<h2>5.

The lack of punctuation is interesting: It serves as neither a question nor a declaration, but nonetheless urges Omandam to never let go of his memories of home. </p>\n\n<p>In the same way, I hope the exhibition will implore visitors to never forget this generation of men and women who paved a path for other Filipino immigrants. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2020-census-detailed-dhc-file-a.html\">More than 4.4 million Americans identify as having Filipino ancestry</a>, according to the 2020 U.S. census. </p>\n\n<p>These objects reflect the stories of ordinary people who were resourceful, creative, resilient and filled with hope in the face of discrimination, racism and legal exclusion. </p>\n\n<p>The odds were constantly stacked against them. And yet they persevered – each strike into the soil, each coin saved to save up for a new suit, each lodge meeting and each beauty pageant taking them one step closer to forging a place for themselves in the American story.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265654/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sam Vong does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

For one, there are the rules: different court dimensions, service restrictions and scoring systems. What’s more, the two events’ political and cultural contexts set them even further apart. While King’s victory is viewed as a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230320819_11\">feminist triumph over entrenched sexism</a>, neither Sabalenka nor Kyrgios seem to be playing for anything beyond the court.</p>\n\n<p>It makes us wonder whether women – and women’s sports more specifically – have anything to gain from this latest battle.</p>\n\n<h2>Putting ‘women’s lib’ on the map</h2>\n\n<p>The feminist movement of the early 1970s saw American women fight for better rights, opportunities, rewards, reproductive freedoms and bodily autonomy. They also sought <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p079740\">access to and equality in sports</a>. Women’s tennis led the way, as King and others bravely formed their own tour, unionized and negotiated for equal pay at the U.S. Open. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/bobby-riggs\">Riggs</a> – a 55-year-old ex-champion and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” – <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Court-Hustler-Bobby-Riggs/dp/0397008937\">was a noisy antagonist</a>. He maintained that better pay should go to men like him on the senior tour, not to women.

Before 30,000 spectators at the Houston Astrodome and another 90 million television viewers, <a href=\"https://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006408.html\">she walloped Riggs in three straight sets</a>. <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469622033/game-set-match/\">Her victory took on an even larger significance</a>, becoming a symbol of what women can accomplish when given the chance. </p>\n\n<p>“It wasn’t about tennis,” <a href=\"https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/columns/hrc031099.html\">King later assessed</a>. “It was about social change.” </p>\n\n<h2>The apolitical star vs. the ‘bad boy’</h2>\n\n<p>So what, then, is the new “battle” about?</p>\n\n<p>King has yet to comment on the 2025 event, but she is a fan of Sabalenka’s game. </p>\n\n<p>“What I love about you is that when you come out to play, you bring all of yourself,” <a href=\"https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/billie-jean-king-directly-tells-aryna-sabalenka-what-she-really-loves-about-her-after-her-us-open-title-win/\">King told the four-time Grand Slam champion</a> after her 2024 U.S. Open victory.</p>\n\n<p>Off the court, however, the two women seem to have little in common. </p>\n\n<p>King has always maintained that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230320819_11\">sports are political</a>; Sabalenka has distanced herself from that position. When asked about Russia’s war in Ukraine, for example, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/sabalenka-sets-sights-wimbledon-after-taking-spotlight-off-politics-2023-06-29/\">the Belarusian explained</a>, “I don’t want sport to be involved in politics, because I’m just a 25-year-old tennis player.” </p>\n\n<p>King never argued that women were better players than the men. But “from a show-biz standpoint,” <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/06/20/79872634.html?pageNumber=37\">she clarified in her 1974 autobiography</a>, “I felt we put on as good a performance as the men – sometimes better – and that that’s what people paid to see.” </p>\n\n<p>Sabalenka, in contrast, once told a reporter that <a href=\"https://www.tennis365.com/wta-tour/aryna-sabalenka-clarify-comments-prefers-watching-mens-tennis\">she prefers watching men’s tennis</a> because “it’s more interesting” than the women’s game.</p>\n\n<p>Comments like Sabalenka’s throw sand into the gears of the ongoing struggle for gender equity, to which King remains committed. Although all four Grand Slam events <a href=\"https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2023-03-30/milestones_in_equality_a_long_climb_to_equal_prize_money_at_the_four_grand_slams.html\">now offer equal prize money</a>, disparities persist at lower-level tournaments. </p>\n\n<p>At the 2024 Italian Open, for instance, men competed for a prize pool of US$8.5 million. The women’s equivalent was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5500585/2024/05/21/tennis-women-inequality-prize-money-schedule/\">$5.5 million</a>. That same year, women’s prize money at the Canadian Open <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5500585/2024/05/21/tennis-women-inequality-prize-money-schedule/\">totaled $2.5 million</a>, while the men split $5.9 million. Men still receive better scheduling and court assignments, more media coverage and more lucrative sponsorships. As former No-2-ranked women’s tennis player <a href=\"https://www.tennis365.com/wta-tour/ons-jabeur-passionate-demands-respect\">Ons Jabeur put it</a>, it’s not “just a question of money, but also respect.”</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Kyrgios, like Riggs more than half a century ago, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5121518/2023/12/11/nick-kyrgios-tennis-aussie/\">has spoken out against equal pay for women players</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, some might say Kyrgios’ sexism makes Riggs’ seem almost quaint. In 2015, he was fined $10,000 after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/13428451/stan-wawrinka-urges-action-nick-kyrgios-mutters-unacceptable-comment\">making vulgar comments</a> about his opponent’s girlfriend during a match. In 2021, he <a href=\"https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/news/2015-08-18/not-about-sledging-kyrgios-comments-reveal-rampant-misogyny-dominates-mens-sport\">pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend</a> after pushing her during an argument. </p>\n\n<p>Kyrgios has “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c51y34xd13eo#:%7E:text=Former%20Wimbledon%20finalist%20Nick%20Kyrgios,Tate%20in%20February%20this%20year.\">gone to all lengths</a>” to distance himself from overtly misogynist influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/andrew-tate-arrests-explained.html\">criminally charged with human trafficking, rape and assault</a>. But this was only after Kyrgios faced significant backlash for expressing “<a href=\"https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/news-embodies-hypermasculine-exclusionary-side-sport-anyone-else-tennis-fans-lash-nick-kyrgios-support-tristan-andrew-tate\">low-key</a>” love for the brothers and reposting Andrew on social platform X for “<a href=\"https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/news-tell-you-re-fanboying-loser-misogynist-please-get-grip-nick-kyrgios-siding-andrew-tate-s-remark-angers-fans\">speaking facts as usual</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Young man smiling while holding a tennis racket and a tennis ball, wearing a green basketball jersey and a backward white cap.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709250/original/file-20251216-92-c5gtxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nick Kyrgios has earned a reputation as the ‘bad boy of tennis.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nick-kyrgios-of-australia-reacts-during-a-practice-session-news-photo/2193178447?adppopup=true\">Daniel Pockett/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Kyrgios – again, like Riggs – is also struggling to remain relevant. </p>\n\n<p>By all accounts, he is a tremendously talented player who has yet to live up to his potential. Plagued with wrist and knee injuries, Kyrgios has competed in only six tour-level matches in the past three years: winning one, losing four and <a href=\"https://www.atptour.com/en/news/kyrgios-indian-wells-2025-retire\">retiring in another</a>. Consequently, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, once ranked in the top 20, is better known as a “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-33427423\">bad boy of tennis</a>” who smashes rackets, makes lewd comments and gestures, tanks matches and verbally abuses umpires.</p>\n\n<h2>A lose-lose for women’s sports?</h2>\n\n<p>Kyrgios’ showdown with Sabalenka may be entertaining. But for women’s sports, it seems like a lose-lose.</p>\n\n<p>If Sabalenka wins, critics will likely claim it’s because she had every advantage. Evolve has modified the rules to make her side of the court 9% smaller than Kyrgios’ in both length and width. The dimensions are based on Evolve’s calculation that the top women players move 9% slower than their male counterparts, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/tennis/battle-of-the-sexes-rules-sabalenka-vs-kyrgios-format-explained-b1256639.html\">although there is no published data to support the claim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To further mitigate Kyrgios’ reported “power and speed advantage,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cvgdn9ewg97o\">both players will be limited to just one serve</a>. Unlike King and Riggs’ best-of-five sets, Sabalenka and Kyrgios will play best-of-three. Split sets between the two competitors will result in a 10-point tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>A Kyrgios victory will only bolster arguments that the best woman cannot compete with the 673rd-ranked man, even when the rules are bent to her favor. We could see those arguments being weaponized against women’s sports more generally, <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-report-women-and-girls-access-sport-still-lagging-far-behind\">which remain underresourced</a> <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/womens-sports-9780190657703?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">and undervalued</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also the question of the venue. </p>\n\n<p>The 2025 event will take place in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE government has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/united-arab-emirates/report-united-arab-emirates/\">egregious human rights abuses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates\">which include</a> gender discrimination, the criminalization of same-sex relations, and clamping down on freedom of speech and the media. Hosting high-profile sporting events distracts from these issues while cleansing the UAE’s public image in what’s known as “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/19/nba-risks-sportswashing-uae-violations\">sportswashing</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to host a tennis “Battle of the Sexes” in a country where women are battling for basic human rights?</p>\n\n<p>The 2017 Hollywood film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4622512/\">Battle of the Sexes</a>” reaffirmed <a href=\"https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/rpa/article-abstract/26/2/97/385733/Sport-Spectacle-Billie-Jean-King-and-the-Battle-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">the importance of the King-Riggs contest</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Barring some surprise twist, no one will make a movie about the Sabalenka-Kyrgios duel in Dubai. We see it as nothing more than a publicity stunt and cash grab for Sabalenka, Kyrgios and, above all, Evolve. If this is “reimagining what equality in sport can look like,” as the organizers claim, then it is equality without substance.</p>\n\n<p>And that is no battle at all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269590/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Meanwhile, New Delhi is more concerned about <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2025/08/indias-china-embrace-and-us-decoupling/\">how to position itself</a> amid the great power competition between China and the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>The result is paralysis for the Quad, for now.</p>\n\n<h2>The evolution of the Quad</h2>\n\n<p>The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, to give the Quad its full name, began life in 2004. </p>\n\n<p>The Quad 1.0 focused on <a href=\"https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/quad-backgrounder#:%7E:text=The%20Quad%20is%20a%20diplomatic%20partnership%20between,prime%20minister%20of%20Japan%20at%20the%20time.\">humanitarian disaster assistance and cooperation</a> after the Indian Ocean tsunami.

Australia withdrew from the partnership in 2008 when it <a href=\"https://www.nbr.org/publication/australia-and-the-quad-a-watering-can-or-a-hammer/\">prioritized trade relations with China</a>. India, too, has at times been tepid about the Quad’s continuation, partly due to its <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-quadfather-the-legacy-of-shinzo-abe-and-the-quad\">legacy of nonalignment</a> and <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-what-the-return-of-quadrilateral-says-about-india-and-emerging-asian-geopolitics-4912740/\">concerns over managing relations with Beijing</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The Quad 2.0 <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/the-quad-20-foundation-free-and-open-indo-pacific#:%7E:text=The%20Quad%20is%20a%20strategic%20dialogue%20among,group%20*%20Shared%20threat%20assessments%20of%20China\">came to life in 2017</a> as the four core members coalesced around a <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/the-quad-20-foundation-free-and-open-indo-pacific\">shared sentiment</a> of countering China’s rising power. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Four men stand for a photo\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709451/original/file-20251217-56-itn9ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Joe Biden participates in a 2024 Quad summit with prime ministers Anthony Albanese of Australia and Narendra Modi of India and Fumio Kishida of Japan.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-joe-biden-participates-in-a-quadrilateral-summit-news-photo/2172751097?adppopup=true\">Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Despite its name, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue has increasingly gravitated toward <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/the-wilmington-declaration-joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-australia-india-japan-and-the-united-states\">nonsecurity agendas</a>, from global health to maritime domain awareness and critical technologies. </p>\n\n<p>Yet even as this emerging <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793930522000022\">Quad 3.0</a> has foregrounded cooperation around the slogan “<a href=\"https://globalaffairs.org/research/report/quads-next-chapter\">development, stability and prosperity</a>,” it is over trade and tariffs that the two largest members of the Quad are not seeing eye to eye. </p>\n\n<h2>The eagle and elephant tussle over tariffs</h2>\n\n<p>On Aug. 1, 2025, Washington imposed a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-vows-protect-farmers-trumps-25-tariff-threat-sparks-opposition-fury-2025-07-31/\">25% reciprocal tariff</a> on Indian goods over long-standing trade frictions, notably over access to India’s agricultural market. It was followed by an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trumps-doubling-tariffs-hits-india-damaging-ties-2025-08-27\">additional 25% punitive duty</a> for New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil.</p>\n\n<p>The combined <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykznn158qo\">50% U.S. tariff</a> was accompanied by another move that upset New Delhi: new U.S. restrictions on H-1B visas. Some 70% of all holders of the U.S. visas, designed for temporary skilled workers, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/india-government-responds-trump-h1b-visa-fees-100k-increase/\">are Indian nationals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The rift between New Delhi and Washington widened with India’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/2025/2025-brics-summit-takeaways-and-projections/#:%7E:text=The%20summit%20adopted%20126%20commitments,against%20global%20conflicts%20and%20wars.\">attend a meeting</a> in Rio de Janeiro in September of the so-called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-brics-cooperation-accelerates-is-it-time-for-the-us-to-develop-a-brics-policy-210021\">BRICS nations</a>. That was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-says-brics-would-end-quickly-if-they-ever-form-meaningful-way-2025-07-18/\">interpreted as an “anti-U.S.” summit</a> by Washington given its composition of largely Global South nations and other countryies antagonistic to the West, including Russia and China. </p>\n\n<p>As a key member of the BRICS grouping, India’s attendance should have come as no real surprise. Even so, and despite Modi’s decision not to attend personally, the U.S. took umbrage, with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick criticizing India’s BRICS membership and <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-russia-ties-brics-us-commerce-secretary-trump-modi-howard-lutnick-2735407-2025-06-04\">accusing New Delhi</a> of having “rubbed the United States the wrong way.”</p>\n\n<p>Lutnick’s comments are indicative of the cooling ties between New Delhi and Washington. Since the end of the Cold War, India has been seen by Washington as a democratic ally and a vital U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific. The two countries have shared <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/divergence-despite-convergence-united-states-india-strategic-partnership-and-defense-norms\">strategic and defense partnerships</a> – a foundational aspect of the Quad.</p>\n\n<p>And despite recent tensions, the factors underpinning U.S.-India relations remain constant. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-top-trading-partner-of-india-for-4th-straight-year-in-fy25-trade-gap-with-china-widens-to-99-2-bn/articleshow/120333409.cms\">reaching US$131.84 billion in the 2024-25 fiscal year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This gives New Delhi not only economic leverage over the U.S. but also a strategic rationale to continue its cooperation with Washington.</p>\n\n<h2>A countering ‘Dragon-Elephant’ tango?</h2>\n\n<p>Yet at the same time, India appears to be increasingly tilting toward China, both economically and in geopolitics.</p>\n\n<p>Modi visited China during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit meeting in August and framed the two countries as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/india-china-are-partners-not-rivals-modi-xi-say-2025-08-31/\">development partners, not rivals</a>.

India’s imports are largely coming from China, especially in the areas of machinery, electronics and other intermediate goods. </p>\n\n<p>Yet for all of the convergence, areas of bilateral tensions remain. India’s growing <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/beyond-trump-s-tariffs-the-domestic-drivers-of-india-s-rapprochement-with-china#:%7E:text=Even%20before%20US%20tariffs%2C%20Indian,entrenched%20this%20asymmetry%20has%20become.\">trade deficit</a> with China and Beijing’s ironclad <a href=\"https://in.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgxw/202405/t20240516_11305420.htm\">relationship with Pakistan</a> – along with unresolved border issues – limit how far New Delhi is willing to align with Beijing strategically. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, India-China relations are no doubt warming, especially <a href=\"https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/09/18/trump-tariffs-prompt-india-to-rethink-china-ties/\">in the wake of Trump’s tariffs</a>. Indicative of that shift were India’s exports to China, which <a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/economy/indias-exports-defy-trump-tariffs-post-fastest-growth-in-over-3-years-trade-deficit-hits-5-month-low-article-153298704\">surged by 90% in November</a> to $2.2 billion.</p>\n\n<h2>Broader sources of Indian-US tension</h2>\n\n<p>It isn’t just the warming China-India relationship that has thrown a wrench into the Quad’s works. The Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2025/10/29/trumps-pakistan-pivot-and-the-future-of-usindia-partnership/\">growing embrace of India’s archrival Pakistan</a> has also soured U.S.-India ties.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mediation-or-informal-diplomacy-decoding-trumps-claims-of-brokering-india-pakistan-truce/articleshow/121392105.cms\">claim to have mediated an end to the brief Pakistan-India war in May</a> and his subsequent invitation of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/#:%7E:text=WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD/NEW%20DELHI%2C,war%2C%22%20Trump%20told%20reporters.\">Pakistan’s army chief to the White House</a> were met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/thawing-of-relations-between-pakistan-and-us-raises-eyebrows-in-india\">with anger in India</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That dispute was mirrored by the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/05/india/india-russian-oil-trump-tariffs-explainer-intl-hnk\">one over Russian oil</a>, which had precipitated some of Trump’s tariffs on India. Modi’s government has walked a tightrope between the U.S. and Russia, wanting to keep open the possibility of good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, while managing tensions with the U.S. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/10/pomp-vladimir-putin-visit-delhi-weak-india-russia-relationship\">Putin’s visit to India</a> in December held such symbolic value.</p>\n\n<p>The Modi government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russias-putin-hold-summit-talks-with-indias-modi-delhi-2025-12-05\">stopped short of explicit long-term commitments</a> to new Russian oil purchases and did not chart any new <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c773v133xnxo\">defense deals</a>. In that, as with the issue over Washington’s embrace of Pakistan, India has sought to balance competing camps, creating space to maintain an open door with the U.S. without abandoning India’s strategic autonomy on what nations it does business with.</p>\n\n<h2>Optimism amid paralysis</h2>\n\n<p>So, how does all this diplomatic tangoing affect the Quad? </p>\n\n<p>The result, it appears, is paralysis at this juncture. But it is important to point out that neither country wants to pronounce the Quad dead. The latest National Security Strategy of the United States explicitly mentions <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-national-security-strategy-report-us-stronger-ties-indo-pacific-vladimir-putin-in-india-9755484\">the Quad</a> as part of efforts to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf\">win the economic future</a>” in Asia. </p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/07/joint-statement-from-the-quad-foreign-ministers-meeting-in-washington/\">both nations continue to reaffirm their commitment</a> to the partnership – betting that political conditions will stabilize and that global trends may turn in their favor.</p>\n\n<p>So there are still reasons for guarded optimism. Recent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/11/19/is-trump-letting-india-slip-away-00661046\">progress in trade negotiations</a> and <a href=\"https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/india-to-curb-russian-oil-imports-as-new-us-sanctions-kick-in-nov-21/125120706\">gradual reductions in Russian oil imports</a> could ease Washington’s skepticism over India.</p>\n\n<p>And for their part, Japan and Australia are trying to keep the momentum going – Japan with its <a href=\"https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/advancing-japanese-diplomacy-through-the-quad-why-it-matters-for-tokyo/\">naval and coast guard capabilities</a> and Australia with <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/regional-architecture/quad\">infrastructure and health initiatives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If a mutually acceptable trade deal with the U.S. can emerge, and New Delhi can craft an agenda for the Quad framework that is acceptable to the current U.S. administration, a leaders summit could still materialize in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>But the louder the tariff wars between India and the U.S. become, the slimmer the chance for a stronger Quad in the near term.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270606/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Hyeran Jo receives funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York (G-PS-24-62004, Small State Statecraft and Realignment).

Not on Collins, a <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/articles/trump-attacks-cnn-nasty-kaitlan-170503023.html\">frequent target of White House ire</a>, but on Leavitt’s predecessor in the Biden White House, Democrat Jen Psaki.</p>\n\n<p>Psaki, claimed Leavitt, stood at the same lectern a year before and told “<a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/leavitt-vs-cnn-s-collins-my-predecessor-used-this-podium-to-lie-and-people-like-you-just-took-her-at-her-word/vi-AA1SbGxQ?ocid=00000000#details\">utter lies</a>.” In contrast, Leavitt insisted, “Everything I’m telling you is the truth backed by real, factual data, and you just don’t want to report on it ’cause you want to push untrue narratives about the president.” </p>\n\n<p>The “real, factual data” that underpinned Leavitt’s statement was specious at best. The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/economy/us-cpi-consumer-prices-inflation-september\">actual inflation rate for September was 3%</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/11/politics/inflation-trump-karoline-leavitt-prices\">not the 2.5% figure cherry-picked from economic data</a>. The rise in real wages? CNN business editor David Goldman writes that <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/realer_11212025.htm\">in the past year</a>, U.S. workers have experienced “the lowest annual paycheck growth <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/16/economy/affordability-wage-growth-inflation\">that Americans have had since May 2021</a>.” </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UuqTZnCjDA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=1419\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks to the media on Dec. 11, 2025.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I’m a historian who has written about <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324075080\">the enduring legacy of George Orwell’s ideas</a> about truth and freedom. Listening to Leavitt assert a “truth” so obviously discordant with people’s lives, I was reminded of the repeated pronouncements from the Ministry of Plenty in <a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/books-by-orwell/nineteen-eighty-four/\">Orwell’s “1984</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>“The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen,” Orwell wrote. “As compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more babies — more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards.” </p>\n\n<p>The novel’s doomed hero, Winston Smith, works in the Records Department that produces these fraudulent statistics – figures that are so far divorced from reality that they “had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie.”  </p>\n\n<p>In the world of “1984,” not only are statistics invented, they are continually reinvented to serve the needs of Big Brother’s regime at any given moment: “All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary.”\n</p>\n\n<h2>Transparency as doublespeak</h2>\n\n<p>The lack of transparency depicted in “1984” has an uncanny echo in our current political moment, despite Leavitt’s repeated assertions that President Donald Trump is the “<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2025-11-20/the-latest-belated-jobs-report-likely-shows-sluggish-hiring\">most transparent president in history</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Leavitt has made that claim countless times, including in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/white-house-defends-trump-piggy-insult\">public defense of Trump’s “Quiet, Piggy!” dismissal</a> of Bloomberg News journalist Catherine Lucey last month.  </p>\n\n<p>In Leavitt’s usage, “transparency” has become a form of Orwellian “doublespeak,” a word or phrase which through the process of “doublethink” had come to encompass its exact opposite meaning. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/bo/podcast/truth-in-an-age-of-doublethink/id1081584611?i=1000736074396\">Doublethink,” in Orwell’s writing</a>, was the mechanism of thought manipulation that allowed someone “to know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them.” </p>\n\n<p>Doublethink was the mechanism that enabled the citizens of Oceania, the Anglo-American superstate governed by Big Brother’s authoritarian regime, to accept that “WAR IS PEACE; FREEDOM IS SLAVERY; IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” </p>\n\n<p>And it is the mechanism that allowed Leavitt to proclaim, in defending Trump’s unwillingness to release the Epstein files, “This administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/trump-karoline-leavitt-jeffrey-epstein\">done more with respect to transparency</a> when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein than any administration ever.” That claim was pronounced “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/trump-karoline-leavitt-jeffrey-epstein\">fabulously audacious</a>” by The Guardian’s Washington bureau chief, David Smith, in a story headlined “Nothing to see here: Trump press chief in full denial mode over Epstein.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmtnrEIR2T4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=218\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">President Ronald Reagan records a radio address on foreign policy on Sept. 24, 1988, in which he discussed “our philosophy of peace through strength.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Making ‘lies sound truthful and murder respectable’</h2>\n\n<p>In his famous essay “<a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/\">Politics and the English Language</a>,” Orwell wrote that “political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.”</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 10 months, Leavitt has, among other things, claimed that the now dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development – USAID – provided a grant of $32,000 for a “<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2025-02-07/claims-about-usaid-funding-are-spreading-online-many-are-not-based-on-facts\">transgender comic book</a>” in Peru. <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/sorting-out-the-facts-on-waste-and-abuse-at-usaid/\">Not true</a>. She has misrepresented the “One Big Beautiful Bill” as <a href=\"https://x.com/PressSec/status/1940607370578805147\">fully eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security</a>. In reality, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-policy-bill.html\">deductions for these are capped</a>. She claimed that Trump <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/karoline-leavitt-gets-instant-fact-check-after-outrageous-new-claim-about-trump/ar-AA1HjfJ9\">coined the motto “peace through strength</a>.” He didn’t. The phrase has been in circulation for decades, used most prominently by <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/permanent-exhibits/peace-through-strength\">Ronald Reagan during his presidency</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And she recently sought to delegitimize U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly and colleagues’ plea to servicemen and women not to obey illegal orders by suggesting tautologically that “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G_w6ZS3kdE\">all lawful orders are presumed to be legal by our servicemembers</a>,” and hence Kelly’s plea could only serve to provoke “disorder and chaos.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-vietnam-to-afghanistan-all-us-governments-lie-128695\">All governments lie</a>. But Leavitt has become a master of the art of political language, wielded to aggrandize her boss, belittle his opponents and deflect attention from administration scandals.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270675/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Laura Beers does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Below is a condensed and edited version of the interview.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Miller: Mark Zuckerberg was the lowest-paid employee at Meta in 2024, and <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680124000022/meta-20240329.htm\">he made US$1</a>. But he is not the only very rich person who has collected $1 for a year’s work. Why would incredibly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2014/04/05/tax-smart-billionaires-who-work-for-1/\">rich CEOs make only $1 a year</a> when they could pay themselves millions?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Madoff:</strong> The reason is taxes. Income from work is the most heavily taxed type of income, as it is subject to both income and payroll taxes. A self-employed person who makes a modest income of $60,000 will <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/payroll-tax/\">pay over $13,000 of it in payroll</a> and <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-federal-income-tax-rates-work\">income taxes</a>. Meanwhile, high-income earners who earn a $400,000 salary can pay about <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/payroll-tax/\">30% of their income in payroll</a> and <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-federal-income-tax-rates-work\">income taxes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So the first step in avoiding taxes is avoiding salary, and that is what our richest Americans often do.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IAHFGFPPfE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Ray Madoff on the ‘It Turns Out’ podcast.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Elon <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a.htm\">Musk received a salary of $0</a> from Tesla in 2024. Jeff <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000110465924045910/tm2329302d4_def14a.htm\">Bezos earns $81,840</a> a year of income, low enough to get the child tax credit, which <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\">he took in 2021</a>. One of our higher-paid billionaires is Warren Buffett, and he only gets <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000119312525054877/d812428ddef14a.htm\">$100,000 a year</a> in salary and bonus combined.</p>\n\n<p>All of these people are keeping their taxes down by keeping their salaries down. They are not avoiding compensation altogether, however, as they are well paid through the growing value of their stock. In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hyunsoorim/2024/04/02/the-10-biggest-billionaire-gainers-2024/\">Bezos’ wealth increased by $80 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hyunsoorim/2024/04/02/the-10-biggest-billionaire-gainers-2024/\">Zuckerberg’s by $113 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/31/billionaires-combined-net-worth-hits-10-trillion-elon-musk-trump-2024/\">Musk’s by $213 billion</a>. Even better, they can enjoy this growing wealth entirely free of income tax and reporting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You make the case that part of the reason that these individuals have been able to accumulate wealth so quickly is because of the tax system. How has the tax system enabled their wealth to continue to grow so quickly?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Historically, the tax system has operated as a bulwark against concentrations of wealth. And in this way, it has served to legitimate our capitalist system by showing how it can work to extract large amounts of money from our wealthiest citizens for the common good.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The cover of a book is shown with the title 'The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=933&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=933&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=933&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1173&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1173&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707935/original/file-20251210-56-pzdbzz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1173&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\"></span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html\">University of Chicago Press</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>However, over the past 40 years or so there have been a number of changes that have allowed the wealthy to avoid taxes altogether on their investments and inheritances. One area where this has particularly been the case is when it comes to investment in stocks. Prior to 1982, companies could only directly share profits with shareholders by issuing dividends. These dividends were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0927-0507(05)80069-6\">taxed at the highest rate</a>. In 1982, however, a subtle change to the SEC rules allowed companies to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/367751\">purchase their own stock</a> on the open market. This may sound innocuous, but it led to a massive transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Now, instead of issuing dividends, companies can purchase shares, which <a href=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/documents/39745/LAZONICK_William_Profits-without-Prosperity-20140406.pdf\">boosts the value</a> of the stock. So any shareholders who do not need to sell can make a profit from their stock going up in value and do not need to pay taxes on this profit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At some point, one might expect that the ultrawealthy would have to sell their shares to finance their lifestyle. Do they? In selling those shares, wouldn’t they have to pay a capital gains tax?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For most of us, when we own property or stock that has increased in value, it doesn’t mean anything to us unless we sell it. But those with great wealth can access that wealth without paying taxes by simply borrowing against their assets. And that is what <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105518\">our richest Americans do</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Billionaires like Larry Ellison and Elon Musk borrow <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2021/11/11/how-americas-richest-people-larry-ellison-elon-musk-can-access-billions-without-selling-their-stock/\">huge sums of money</a> to support their lifestyle, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-ellison-has-a-10b-credit-line-2014-9\">pledging their stock as collateral</a>. This <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105518\">borrowing is entirely tax-free</a> and comes at good rates. In addition, in recent years the growth in stock <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000119312514350236/d778087ddef14a.htm\">value more than compensates</a> for any interest that might accrue. To pay the interest and pay back the loans, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272725002178?vi\">they simply borrow again</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does this mean the people with the most money are not contributing to the common expenses of the government? What about through the estate tax?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One would think that the estate tax would do a good job here. After all, it is a 40% tax on all transfers by gift or at death in excess of approximately $15 million. However, this tax no longer accomplishes what it once did.</p>\n\n<p>During the George W. Bush presidency, <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/public-citizen-and-united-for-a-fair-economy-expose-stealth-campaign-of-super-wealthy-to-repeal-federal-estate-tax/\">18 wealthy families launched a campaign</a> to repeal the federal estate tax. It labeled the estate tax the “<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cx8r20r\">death tax</a>,” calling it an unfair double-taxation that <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cx8r20r#main\">harms family farms and businesses</a>. <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/803\">Chester Thigpen</a>, who owned a Christmas tree farm, was the face of this movement. He argued that the estate tax took away his right to pass his Christmas tree farm to his children.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Ripped $100 bill against a blue background\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707945/original/file-20251210-62-qr5ei7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The mighty $100 bill.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/cryptocurrency-or-money-transfer-concepts-royalty-free-image/1357452566?phrase=tech%20ceos%20tax&amp;adppopup=true\">dem10/Getty</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This narrative was completely false. The estate tax <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cx8r20r#main\">has many provisions</a> to protect family farms and businesses. And Thigpen was misled; he was <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2016/06/08/half-prince-s-300-million-estate-taxed-good-thing/\">never subject to the estate tax</a>, as his estate was much smaller than the exclusion amount.</p>\n\n<p>But much of the public began to believe that the estate tax – or the “death tax” – was unfair. Though there is nominally an estate tax today, Congress has not enacted a single provision to close loopholes in 35 years. As a result, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5395134\">loopholes abound</a> that allow the wealthy to shelter their money from taxation. These mechanisms are so effective that even though the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5395134\">wealthiest 1% of Americans own $50 trillion</a>, the entire amount collected by the estate tax <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5395134\">in 2024 was about $30 billion</a>, an amount that Musk has <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/10/24/elon-musk-richest-man-30-billion-single-day-net-worth-tesla-most-powerful-company/\">gained and lost in a day</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the estate tax serves as a cover for the richest Americans, who are served better by preserving a tax that makes it look like they pay taxes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If the richest Americans do not pay taxes, who does the brunt of the burden fall to?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In terms of our yearly income tax, the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/latest-federal-income-tax-data-2025/\">brunt of the burden falls on high-income earners</a>, people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. These people can be paying up to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/payroll-tax/\">50% of what they make in payroll</a> and <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-federal-income-tax-rates-work\">income taxes</a>. Confused, they think their interests align with the ultrawealthy more than regular workers. In fact, people who earn a lot through their job – from doctors to executives – are carrying the largest burden, alongside lower-wage workers.</p>\n\n<p>Popular statistics make it seem as though the richest Americans are paying the majority of taxes. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/fact-check-richest-1-dont-pay-40-of-the-taxes.html\">One such statistic</a> is that the top 1% pay 40% of the income taxes, while 40% of Americans pay no income tax at all. The top 1% here refers to income earners. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, the very richest Americans do not acquire their wealth through taxable income and are just as likely to be a part of the 40% of the lowest earners who pay no income tax.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, <a href=\"https://ceoworld.biz/2025/12/03/americas-top-1-now-hold-52-trillion-more-wealth-than-ever-before/\">30% of U.S. wealth is now controlled by the richest 1%</a> of Americans, and our current rules provide no assurances that they will ever pay taxes on their growing wealth.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271714/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ray Madoff does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The timing couldn’t be worse.</p>\n\n<h2>A perfect storm: Rising demand, looming shortages</h2>\n\n<p>America’s health care system is entering an unprecedented period of strain. An <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/09/us-centenarian-population-is-projected-to-quadruple-over-the-next-30-years/\">aging population</a>, coupled with rising rates of <a href=\"https://nam.edu/product/health-basics-chronic-disease/\">chronic conditions</a>, is driving demand for care to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-024-00148-2\">new heights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The workforce isn’t growing fast enough to meet those needs. The U.S. faces a projected <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage\">shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians</a> by 2036. Hospitals, clinics and elder-care services are expected to add <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecopro_09062023.pdf?\">about 2.1 million jobs between 2022 and 2032</a>. Many of those will be <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm\">front-line caregiving roles</a>: home health, personal care and nursing assistants.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, immigrant health care workers have filled gaps where U.S.-born workers are limited. They serve as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/08/h1b-visa-fees-rural-health/\">doctors in rural clinics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/the-growing-role-of-foreign-educated-nurses-in-u-s-hospitals-and-implications-of-visa-restrictions/\">nurses in understaffed hospitals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/what-role-do-immigrants-play-in-the-direct-long-term-care-workforce/\">aides in nursing homes and home care settings</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nationally, immigrants make up <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/health-care-employment-growth-immigration-crackdown-medicaid-cuts/\">about 18% of the health care workforce</a>, and they’re even more concentrated in critical roles. Roughly 1 in 4 physicians, 1 in 5 registered nurses and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/what-role-do-immigrants-play-in-the-direct-long-term-care-workforce/\">1 in 3 home health aides</a> are foreign-born.</p>\n\n<p>State-level data reveals just how deeply immigrants are embedded in the health care system. <a href=\"https://www.ppic.org/blog/immigrants-are-key-to-californias-health-workforce\">Consider California</a>, where immigrants account for 1 in 3 physicians, 36% of registered nurses and 42% of health aides. On the other side of the country, immigrants make up 35% of hospital staff in New York state. In New York City, they are the majority of health care workers, representing <a href=\"https://www.steptwopolicy.org/post/the-importance-of-immigrants-in-new-york-s-healthcare-workforce\">57% of the health care workforce</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even in states with smaller immigrant populations, their impact is outsized.</p>\n\n<p>In Minnesota, immigrants are nearly <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/greater-minnesota/2025/01/staff-strapped-nursing-homes-look-to-new-americans-for-help/\">1 in 3 nursing assistants in nursing homes and home care agencies</a>, despite being just 12% of the overall workforce. Iowa, where immigrants are <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/profile/Iowa?g=040XX00US19\">just 6.3% of the population</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903327904576526294052507136\">relies on them</a> for a disproportionate share of rural physicians. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"FPgje\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FPgje/9/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These patterns transcend geography and partisan divides. From urban hospitals to rural clinics, immigrants keep facilities operational. Policies that reduce their numbers – through higher visa fees, stricter eligibility requirements or increased deportations – have <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/what-role-do-immigrants-play-in-the-hospital-workforce/\" title=\"): [vacant shifts](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/18/trump-immigration-nursing-homes \">ripple effects</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trumps-h-1b-visa-fee-increase-raises-us-doctor-shortage-concerns-2025-09-24/\" title=\") and [longer waits for routine care](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2504949 \">closed hospital beds</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While health care demand soars, the pipeline for new health care workers could struggle to keep pace under current rules. Medical schools and nursing programs <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/graduate-loan-caps-put-advanced-nursing-education-and-access-care-risk\">face capacity limits</a>, and the time required to train new professionals – often <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/media/75231/download?attachment\">a decade for doctors</a> – means that <a href=\"https://www.amga.org/getmedia/e195c030-f2a4-4919-8912-92329b007cc1/2025-strengthening-gme-issue-brief.pdf\">there aren’t any quick fixes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Immigrants have long bridged this gap – not just in clinical roles but in research and innovation. International students, who often pursue STEM and health-related fields at U.S. universities, are a key part of this pipeline. Yet recent surveys from the <a href=\"https://cgsnet.org/data-infographics/status-of-2025-international-student-admissions\">Council of Graduate Schools show a sharp decline</a> in new international student enrollment for the 2025-26 academic year, driven partly by <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/new-international-enrollment-decline-fall-nafsa/806482/\">visa uncertainties</a> and global talent competition.</p>\n\n<p>If this trend holds, the smaller cohorts arriving today will mean fewer physicians, nurses, biostatisticians and medical researchers in the coming decade – precisely when demand peaks. Although no major research organization has yet modeled the full impact that <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/immigration-as-a-solution-to-healthcare-workforce-shortages\">stricter immigration policies</a> could have on the health care workforce, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2504949\">experts warn</a> that tighter visa rules, higher application fees and stepped-up enforcement are likely to intensify shortages, not ease them.</p>\n\n<p>These policies <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trumps-h-1b-visa-fee-increase-raises-us-doctor-shortage-concerns-2025-09-24/\">make it harder to hire foreign-born workers</a> and create uncertainty for those already here. In turn, that complicates efforts to staff hospitals, clinics and long-term care facilities at a moment when the system can least afford additional strain.</p>\n\n<h2>The hidden toll: Delayed care, rising risks</h2>\n\n<p>Patients don’t feel staffing gaps as statistics – they feel them physically.</p>\n\n<p>A specialist appointment delayed by months can mean worsening pain. Older adults without home care aides face higher risks of falls, malnutrition and medication errors. An understaffed nursing home turning away patients leaves families scrambling. These aren’t hypotheticals – they’re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/07/us-nursing-home-workers-face-catastrophic-crisis-understaffing\">already happening</a> in <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/05/02/doctor-appointment-wait-times-solutions/\">pockets of the country</a> where <a href=\"https://www.ahcancal.org/News-and-Communications/Press-Releases/Pages/State-Of-The-Sector-Nursing-Home-Staffing-Shortages-Persist-Despite-Unprecedented-Efforts-To-Attract-More-Staff-.aspx\">shortages are acute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The costs of restrictive immigration policies won’t appear in federal budgets but in human tolls: months spent with untreated depression, discomfort awaiting procedures, or preventable hospitalizations. Rural communities, often served by immigrant physicians, and urban nursing homes, reliant on immigrant aides, <a href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/foreign-born-doctors-help-serve-rural-and-low-income-communities\">will feel this most acutely</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most Americans won’t read a visa bulletin or a labor market forecast over holiday dinners. But they will notice when it becomes harder to get care for a child, a partner or an aging parent.</p>\n\n<p>Aligning immigration policy with the realities of the health care system will not, by itself, fix every problem in U.S. health care. But tightening the rules in the face of rising demand and known shortages almost guarantees more disruption. If policymakers connect immigration policy to workforce realities, and adjust it accordingly, they can help ensure that when Americans reach out for care, someone is there to answer.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271586/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bedassa Tadesse does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Caregiving remains <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/economic-fact/seven-economic-facts-about-prime-age-labor-force-participation/\">the top reason</a> women ages 25-54 leave the workforce.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s not just parents who struggle. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.caregivingintheus.org/\">60 million Americans</a> provide care for <a href=\"https://www.johnahartford.org/newsroom/view/warning-from-older-adults-care-for-aging-in-america-needs-urgent-rethinking\">an adult family member</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/working-while-caregiving\">two-thirds say they have trouble balancing their jobs with their caregiving responsibilities</a>. Nearly 1 in 4 working caregivers reported either <a href=\"https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(22)02069-1/fulltext\">missing work or being less productive</a> because of their care duties.</p>\n\n<p>When the demands become too much to juggle, some people quit their jobs, cut back on their hours or turn down promotions in order to provide unpaid care. For many households, that’s a financial strain; others save money that way. But even so, the decision can feel heavy – like leaving behind a sense of purpose that extends beyond the family.</p>\n\n<p>These choices force deeper questions: What counts as meaningful work? What do we owe to others, and what’s reasonable to expect of any one person?</p>\n\n<p>For many people, work and family are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/\">central to identity</a> and how they hope to make a difference in the world. Men and women struggling with whether to step back from a career may wonder whether doing so is the best use of skills or training. Do we owe the world something “bigger”? As much as we care about loved ones, caregiving can feel too small and personal to matter.</p>\n\n<p>As someone who <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2009.00164.x\">writes and teaches about ethics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/11/14/why-we-cant-agree-gun-control/\">social policy</a>, I believe philosophy can help people see these decisions more clearly. Ethics doesn’t give tidy answers or eliminate the tension between work and care, but it can help us understand their moral value.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Too small’?</h2>\n\n<p>Today, American culture often measures moral worth in terms of results and impact – where doing good means doing more. In this context, stepping back from a professional career to care for a loved one can <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\">feel like a failure of ambition or responsibility</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If ambition is measured by observable progress, caregiving is especially vulnerable to being misread as “leaning out.” Many of the daily tasks of caregiving – feeding, bathing, dressing and driving to appointments – can seem inconsequential. The end result of much of this work is invisible: You wind up in the same place you were before. For all the work that goes into sustaining life, there aren’t many “impressive outcomes” to point to. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A brunette man with glasses holds an infant in one arm as he reaches into a sink in a cluttered kitchen.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707494/original/file-20251209-56-uc7p5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Doing the dishes brings you back to where you started, but it also keeps life going.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/father-holding-his-baby-while-looking-at-dirty-royalty-free-image/2216724774?phrase=parent%20doing%20dishes%20overwhelmed&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">AJ_Watt/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In fact, one of care’s most important benefits lies in preventing outcomes: avoiding injuries, medication errors, hospital admissions, developmental delays, cognitive decline, loneliness, depression and so on. These “nonevents” are easy to overlook. In public health, this is sometimes referred to as <a href=\"https://www.sir.advancedleadership.harvard.edu/articles/preparing-for-crisis-and-learning-to-fail-safer-in-complicated-world\">the “preparedness paradox</a>”: The better prevention works, the less visible its effects.</p>\n\n<p>Appreciating the full value of care means considering what would happen without it. If the answer is that there would be more risk, more crises or more downstream costs, then care is making a difference. <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/principles-of-biomedical-ethics-9780190640873\">Health care ethicists</a>, for example, use this kind of counterfactual reasoning to evaluate harm and benefit, asking how a patient would have fared without an intervention. Caregiving that reduces vulnerability and prevents suffering is a genuine moral achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Still, helping a handful of people can look minor compared to careers measured by reach or scale. Good care requires a level of presence and attentiveness that just can’t be scaled.</p>\n\n<p>But that isn’t a failure. “Smallness” is actually part of the point: Care is personal – and “personal” doesn’t mean morally trivial.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there’s a rich philosophical tradition that puts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1q26k08\">meeting the needs of the people we’re responsible for</a> <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/starting-at-home/paper\">at the very heart of moral life</a>. Relationships are core to who we are. In care ethicists’ view, attachments to other people are not distractions from morality but expressions of what it means to live a good human life. </p>\n\n<p>Close relationships make special claims on us. Ties with particular people <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/0195180992.001.0001\">carry moral weight</a>, not just emotions – they give genuine reasons to act. As philosopher <a href=\"https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/samuel-scheffler.html\">Samuel Scheffler</a> <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/boundaries-and-allegiances-9780199257676?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">notes</a>, it makes little sense to say we value a relationship if we don’t think it places any demands on us. Caring about another person’s needs is part of what it means to care about them.</p>\n\n<p>Attending to a loved one’s needs and interests honors those special claims and imbues care tasks with extra meaning – showing someone that we believe they’re worth our time and attention. Caring for loved ones might be modest in reach, but making another person feel truly seen and valued can make a deep impact.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Too personal’?</h2>\n\n<p>Even if care isn’t “too small” to matter, it might still seem too personal to matter much to the wider world. But while care is certainly personal, it’s also socially significant. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young Asian woman reaches around to hug an older Asian woman from behind, as they sit in a sun-lit room.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707496/original/file-20251209-56-8gx2p7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Seen in the right light, caregiving work shouldn’t feel ‘small.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/asian-family-old-woman-hugging-her-daughter-and-royalty-free-image/2213199157?phrase=caring%20for%20an%20elder%20parent&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">travelism/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As care ethicists like <a href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/jctronto\">Joan Tronto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/_faculty/kittay.php\">Eva Kittay</a> argue, caring for particular people reveals something universal about the human condition: Everyone is dependent and sustained by care at different points in our lives. Former first lady <a href=\"https://rosalynncarter.org/programs/\">Rosalynn Carter</a> captured it simply: “There are only four kinds of people in the world – those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.” </p>\n\n<p>Understanding dependency as a shared human condition helps explain why care is foundational to collective well-being. Unpaid caregiving in the U.S. is worth an estimated <a href=\"https://nationalpartnership.org/if-americans-were-paid-for-their-caregiving-they-would-make-more-than-1-1-trillion/\">US$1.1 trillion annually</a>, making it one of the largest sources of social support.</p>\n\n<p>However, care has value beyond its economic impact. Care makes family, community and civic life possible, with benefits that reach well beyond the household. As economist <a href=\"https://peri.umass.edu/person/nancy-folbre/\">Nancy Folbre</a> writes in “<a href=\"https://thenewpress.org/books/9781565847477/?v=eb65bcceaa5f\">The Invisible Heart</a>”: “Parents who raise happy, healthy, and successful children create an especially important public good” – one that will benefit employers, neighbors and fellow citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Treating care as a private matter rather than a shared social good has consequences. It places the moral and practical weight of caregiving on individual families – <a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-free-time-gender-gap/\">most often on women</a>. I believe this narrow view unfairly shifts responsibility and also distorts value, limiting society’s sense of what matters.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/state-caregiving-policy-wins/\">Policy changes</a> could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/11/childcare-family-movement\">ease the strain on caregivers</a> but wouldn’t remove the personal choices families face every day. Even in a more supportive system, I believe Americans would need ways of thinking about work and care that give a fuller account of their value. Caregiving’s broader public benefits are diffuse and hard to measure. But recognizing that care sustains not only families but communities too is a reminder that paid work and unpaid care are not opposites. They are both ways to contribute to the common good. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, loved ones’ needs can often be met without career changes. But when families need to make tough choices, it helps to have a fuller picture. Care ethics is not a demand for perfect caregiving or self-sacrifice; it’s an argument that care matters and that people deserve support as they respond to real limits. Stepping back from work to care doesn’t have to mean stepping back from contributing to the world – it changes where contribution happens.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265025/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jen Zamzow has received funding from UC Berkeley&#39;s Greater Good Science Center, as part of its “Spreading Love Through the Media” initiative, supported by the John Templeton Foundation.</span></em></p>",

National Guard troops patrol American cities, and protesters decry their presence as a “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/nx-s1-5505271/three-republican-led-states-to-send-hundreds-of-national-guard-troops-to-washington\">fascist takeover</a>.” White supremacists openly proclaim <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">racist and antisemitic views</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is the United States sliding into fascism? It’s a question that <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324074397\">divides a good portion of the country today</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Embracing a belief in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-exceptionalism\">American exceptionalism</a> – the idea that America is a unique and morally superior country – some historians suggest that “<a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/it-cant-happen-here-probably/\">it can’t happen here</a>,” echoing the satirical title of <a href=\"https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/ten-minute-book-club/lewis-it-cant-happen-here\">Sinclair Lewis’ 1935 book</a> about creeping fascism in America. The social conditions required for fascism to take root do not exist in the U.S., these historians say. </p>\n\n<p>Still, while fascist ideas never found a foothold among the majority of Americans, they exerted considerable influence during the period between the first and second world wars. Extremist groups like the <a href=\"https://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2020/11/22/fascism-in-1930s-america-the-silver-shirts\">Silver Shirts</a>, the <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/iacs/2021/09/28/nazis-of-copley-square-the-forgotten-story-of-the-christian-front/\">Christian Front</a>, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0010417500010550\">Black Legion</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.americanacademy.de/event/populism-fascism-and-the-klu-klux-klan-of-the-1920s/\">Ku Klux Klan</a> claimed hundreds of thousands of members. Together they glorified a white Christian nation purified of Jews, Black Americans, immigrants and communists. </p>\n\n<p>During the 1930s and early ’40s, fascist ideas were promoted and cheered on American soil by groups such as the pro-Nazi <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/german-american-bund\">German American Bund</a>, which staged a mass rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden in February 1939, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/02/20/695941323/when-nazis-took-manhattan\">displaying George Washington’s portrait alongside swastikas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Bund also operated lodges, storefronts, summer camps, beer halls and newspapers across the country and denounced the “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/08/archives/when-the-bund-strutted-in-yaphank-40-years-ago-in-yaphank.html\">melting pot</a>.” It encouraged boycotts and street brawls against Jews and leftists and forged links to Germany’s Nazi party. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the Bund and other far-right groups have largely vanished from public memory, even in communities where they once enjoyed popularity. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c0slKvwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">As a sociologist</a> of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199733583.001.0001\">collective memory and identity</a>, I wanted to know why that is the case. </p>\n\n<h2>The Bund in New Jersey</h2>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17506980251350248\">analysis of hundreds of oral histories</a> of people who grew up in New Jersey in the 1930s and ’40s, where <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/nazi-town-usa-scenes-summer-camp-nazi-town-us/\">the German American Bund enjoyed a particularly strong presence</a>, suggests that witnesses saw them as insignificant, “un-American” and unworthy of remembrance. </p>\n\n<p>But the people who rallied with the Bund for a white, Christian nation were <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9780807857069/hoods-and-shirts/\">ordinary citizens</a>. They were mechanics and shopkeepers, churchgoers and small businessmen, and sometimes elected officials. They frequented diners, led PTA meetings and went to church.

Even Jewish interviewees who recalled fearful encounters with Bundists during that period tended to minimize the threat in retrospect. Like their German American counterparts, they framed the Bund as deviant and ephemeral. Few believed the group, and the ideas for which it stood, were significant. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the German Americans’ laughter decades after the war was over, and after the revelations of the mass murder of European Jews, may have been a way for them to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACIIW52867.2021.9666424\">distance themselves from feelings of shame or discomfort</a>. As cognitive psychologists show, people tend to erase or minimize inconvenient or painful facts that may threaten their sense of self. </p>\n\n<p>Collective memories are also highly selective. They are influenced by the groups – nation, community, family – in which they are members. In other words, the past is always shaped by the needs of the present.</p>\n\n<p>After World War II, for example, some Americans reframed the <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/products/1568-the-cultural-front\">major threat facing the U.S. as communism</a>. They cast fascism as a defeated foreign evil, while elevating “reds” as the existential threat. Collectively, Americans preferred a simpler national tale: Fascism was “over there.” America was the bulwark of democracy “over here.” This is one way forgetting works.</p>\n\n<p>Communities will remember what they have forgotten or minimized when history is taught, markers are erected, archives are preserved and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203135969\">commemorations are staged</a>. The U.S. has done that <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/remember/international-holocaust-remembrance-day\">for the Holocaust</a> and for the <a href=\"https://legacysites.eji.org/about/memorial/\">Civil Rights Movement</a>. But when it comes to the history of homegrown fascism, and local resistance to it, few communities have made efforts to preserve this history.  </p>\n\n<h2>Remembering difficult pasts</h2>\n\n<p>At least one community has tried. In Southbury, Connecticut, community members erected a small plaque in 2022 to honor townspeople who in 1937 organized to keep the Bund from building a training camp there. The inscription is simple: “<a href=\"https://connecticuthistory.org/southbury-takes-on-the-nazis/\">Southbury Stops Nazi Training Camp</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Mounted police form a line in front of hundreds of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=593&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=593&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707874/original/file-20251210-56-8l3jjw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=593&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">New York City mounted police form a line outside Madison Square Garden, where the German American Bund was holding a rally on Feb. 20, 1939.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/AmericanNazis/f5e70fcbe2724d15b08a7e68c8e054e1/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Murray Becker</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The story it tells provides more than an example of local pride – it’s a template for how communities can commemorate the moments when ordinary citizens said “no.” </p>\n\n<p>When Americans insist that “it can’t happen here,” they exempt themselves from vigilance.

When the court heard <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2025/24-781\">oral arguments on Dec. 2, 2025</a>, the word “abortion” came up only three times. The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-781_f2bh.pdf\">first instance</a> was more than an hour into the 82-minute hearing.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2025/24-781\">First Choice Women’s Resource Centers Inc. v. Platkin</a> hinges on whether First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association give a chain of five crisis pregnancy centers in New Jersey the right to protect its donor records from disclosure to state authorities. The centers are Christian nonprofits that try to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/journalofethics.2018.20.3.pfor1-1803\">stop pregnant women from obtaining abortions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-support-for-crisis-pregnancy-centers-is-surging-after-the-end-of-roe-v-wade\">more than 2,500 of them</a> across the United States.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve done <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KW1w1uMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">extensive research regarding crisis pregnancy centers</a>, and I’ve written about that work in more than a dozen articles in academic journals, books and the media.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Resembling doctors’ offices in appearance only</h2>\n\n<p>Many critics of the centers call them “<a href=\"https://www.exposefakeclinics.com/\">fake clinics</a>” because the centers appear to be medical facilities when they are not. </p>\n\n<p>Often, their waiting rooms look like those at doctors’ offices, and their volunteers wear white lab coats or medical scrubs. And they offer free services that people think of as medical, such as <a href=\"https://tif.ssrc.org/2020/08/07/crisis-pregnancy-centers-and-sonograms/\">pregnancy tests and ultrasounds</a>. But these pregnancy tests are typically the same kind that drugstores sell over the counter. </p>\n\n<p>They’re able to function without medical professionals because it’s generally <a href=\"https://ultrasoundtrainers.com/blogs/do-elective-ultrasound-studios-require-a-medical-license/\">legal in the U.S. to operate ultrasound machines</a> without any specialized training. They ask clients to read their own pregnancy tests so they can avoid laws regarding medical licensing.</p>\n\n<p>Under current law, crisis pregnancy centers don’t need to tell their clients that they are not medical clinics. Nor must they disclose that they don’t provide abortions or birth control.</p>\n\n<p>After California enacted a law that would force the centers to provide their clients with accurate information, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-hands-victory-to-pro-life-crisis-pregnancy-centers-99008\">Supreme Court ruled</a> in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1140\">2018 that it was unconstitutional</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C571%2C5472%2C3078&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person holds an umbrella that reads '#EndTheLies' during a rally outside the Supreme Court.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C571%2C5472%2C3078&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706806/original/file-20251206-56-6o36db.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Supporters of abortion rights rally outside the Supreme Court in 2018, as the court hears a case regarding California’s regulation of crisis pregnancy centers.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=pregnancy%20crisis%20center&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Andrew Harnik</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The centers also don’t have to tell their clients that they are not bound by the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-hipaa-privacy-rule-a-health-law-scholar-explains-164925\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a>, or HIPAA, or other patient privacy laws.

Many major medical organizations have issued statements to this effect, including the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/patient-resources/faqs/special-procedures/induced-abortion\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/amp-64-9-863.pdf\">American Psychological Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/abortion/faq-20058551\">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In response to these concerns, crisis pregnancy centers often reference the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-business-health-nashville-personal-taxes-fffa6f6f86e6eaa448b8ea89087a1c46\">goods and services they offer to women in need</a>.

It makes claims about the prevalence of what it calls “post-abortion stress disorder,” a <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/post-abortion-syndrome\">nonmedical term</a> used by anti-abortion activists who have sought to falsely frame abortion as if it is something most women regret.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, long-term studies show that 95% of women who have had abortions <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Turnaway-Study/Diana-Greene-Foster/9781982141578\">believe they made the right decision</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>State consumer fraud investigation</h2>\n\n<p>In November 2023, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-941/301449/20240226143550977_USSC%20Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Mandamus.pdf\">New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin began investigating</a> First Choice Women’s Resource Center to see whether the nonprofit had violated state consumer fraud laws by misrepresenting its services to clients, donors and the public.</p>\n\n<p>Part of that probe, which was interrupted by the litigation that culminated in this Supreme Court case, included <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-781/339705/20250121112546465_USSC%20Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Certiorari.pdf\">requesting documents about the center’s donors</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The next month, <a href=\"https://adflegal.org/press-release/nj-attorney-general-unlawfully-targets-pro-life-pregnancy-center/\">First Choice sued Platkin</a> in federal court. \nThe lawsuit asserted that the First Amendment protects the privacy of First Choice’s donors.</p>\n\n<p>A district court and appeals and court determined that this case should be heard in state court.</p>\n\n<p>But instead of pursuing the case at the state level, <a href=\"https://adflegal.org/case/first-choice-womens-resource-centers-v-platkin/\">First Choice appealed directly</a> to the Supreme Court, which <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061625zor_4g25.pdf\">decided in June 2025 to take the case</a>. </p>\n\n<p>New Jersey’s fraud investigation and the “sweeping subpoena” it issued “may chill First Amendment freedoms,” said attorney Erin Hawley, when she <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-781_f2bh.pdf\">argued the case before the Supreme Court</a> on behalf of First Choice.</p>\n\n<p>Following oral arguments, <a href=\"https://www.njoag.gov/statement-from-attorney-general-matthew-j-platkin-on-supreme-court-arguments-in-first-choice-v-platkin/\">Platkin released a statement</a> that said “First Choice – a crisis pregnancy center operating in New Jersey – has for years refused to answer questions about its operations in our state and the potential misrepresentations it has been making.”</p>\n\n<h2>Analyzing training manuals</h2>\n\n<p>Many crisis pregnancy centers like First Choice are affiliated with large networks that provide training materials.</p>\n\n<p>For example, First Choice is affiliated with <a href=\"https://www.heartbeatservices.org/services-home\">Heartbeat International</a>, a Christian anti-abortion global network, which says that it has 45,000 active volunteers. Because those volunteers undergo training, I’ve been learning more about the centers by examining the network’s volunteer and staff manuals. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve analyzed nearly 1,600 pages of these materials put together by large anti-abortion networks, including Heartbeat International. Along the way, I’ve tracked medical misinformation and references to confidentiality, privacy and data retention.</p>\n\n<p>These training guides instruct volunteers to highlight the “medical services” their center provides and to omit “Christian language” from their branding and materials.</p>\n\n<p>But the manuals I examined indicate that advancing their religious beliefs, rather than providing health care, is the centers’ primary goal. One manual says, “Heartbeat International is convinced that the loving outreach of a pregnancy center in the name of Jesus Christ is the most valuable ‘service’ provided, no matter what else is on the list of services.”</p>\n\n<p>Heartbeat International’s Talking About Abortion manual includes medical misinformation about the supposed risks of having an abortion, such as cancer and mortality risks. It encourages volunteers to share these claims with clients. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.acog.org/advocacy/abortion-is-essential/trending-issues/issue-brief-crisis-pregnancy-centers\">None of that information</a>, which includes official-sounding statistics, is backed by peer-reviewed scientific research.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A sign advertises free pregnancy tests and abortion information outside a building identified as the Woman's Choice Pregnancy Resource Center.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706752/original/file-20251205-56-eqvdqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Crisis pregnancy centers, like this one in Charleston, West Va., sometimes have names that suggest they offer abortions, evoking the pro-choice branding of the abortion rights movement.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=pregnancy%20crisis%20centers&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Leah M.

At the same time, the manuals inform volunteers that crisis pregnancy centers are “not governed by HIPAA” precisely because they are not medical clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the manuals make clear that the centers can offer clients the opportunity to request confidentiality. But as stated in Heartbeat International’s Medical Essentials training manual, they “are under no obligation to accept or abide” by that request. </p>\n\n<p>To New Jersey Attorney General Platkin, these kinds of approaches <a href=\"https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Documents/crisis-pregnancy-centers.pdf\">seemed worthy of investigation</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Fewer obstacles ahead?</h2>\n\n<p>Should the Supreme Court majority rule in favor of First Choice, I believe states may have more trouble trying to investigate crisis pregnancy centers’ practices, while anti-abortion networks may face even fewer obstacles to their efforts to publicize medical misinformation.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, Aimee Huber, First Choice’s executive director, has said she hopes other states would “back off” any other efforts to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-opponents-appeal-investigation-445af6cd705c6c59097efdf9377dd0ce\">probe crisis pregnancy centers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But based on my 20 years of experience researching crisis pregnancy centers, I also believe that this case can be helpful for abortion rights supporters because it shows that the crisis pregnancy center industry understands that greater public awareness of its practices may restrict its power.</p>\n\n<p><em>Heartbeat International did not respond to a request for comment by The Conversation.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271254/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carly Thomsen consults for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch.

Scott Applewhite/AP</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>The Oct. 27, 2025, interview between former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and political streamer Nick Fuentes created a rare public divide inside the MAGA movement. </p>\n\n<p>Critics <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-heritage-foundation-kevin-roberts\">say Carlson gave Fuentes a national platform</a> to advance his antisemitic and white nationalist views. Some conservatives, including <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/17/trump-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview\">President Donald Trump</a> and Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/kevin-roberts-heritage-foundation-nick-fuentes.html\">defended the conversation</a> as necessary to understand a growing segment of the movement. </p>\n\n<p>These reactions may seem incompatible, but both contain slices of the truth. Public debates about extreme views often pull us toward simple binaries – platform or censor, engage or avoid – when the real issue is how the engagement is structured and the purpose it serves.</p>\n\n<p>The current tension raises a broader question that extends beyond any single interview: When does a conversation with someone who holds extreme views illuminate their beliefs, which could serve the public interest, and when might it risk being interpreted as validation? </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IEl1misAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a communication scholar</a> who studies how people engage across deep divides, I see this as a question not about whether to interact with individuals who espouse extremist views, but how to structure that engagement and to what end.</p>\n\n<h2>Engaging ideas does not mean endorsing</h2>\n\n<p>When public figures say they are “just asking questions” or having a “respectful debate,” it’s easy to assume they believe that all conversation is valuable. Indeed, Carlson opened his interview by claiming he is simply “trying to understand” what Fuentes “affirmatively believes.” </p>\n\n<p>In practice, however, the format and tone of an interview do much of the ethical work. Some conversations interrogate ideas. Others normalize them, meaning <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/discounting-extreme-positions-party-normalization-and-support-for-the-far-right/778405D465952022DD2E23FF02087D6A\">they make extreme claims sound ordinary or socially acceptable</a> – in other words, treating them as just another position in public debate rather than as views outside widely shared  norms. A conversation that presents all viewpoints as morally equivalent risks signaling that even extreme positions belong within normal political discourse. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, defended the interview with Nick Fuentes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707278/original/file-20251209-56-khqh7s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, has defended Carlson’s decision to interview Fuentes, leading to some resignations from Heritage staff and board members.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Election2024DeSantis/72d30cda5758408db148c076eeffb7bd/photo?vs=false\">Jess Rapfogel/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This is the concern raised by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nick-fuentes-is-a-master-of-exploiting-the-current-social-media-opportunities-for-extremism-269776\">Carlson’s interview</a>. Fuentes has made a series of claims about Jewish people that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/leaders-on-the-right-must-unequivocally-condemn-antisemitism/#:%7E:text=Fuentes%20has%20made%20numerous%20antisemitic,to%20cancel%20him%20will%20fail.\">mainstream conservatives have rejected</a> for decades. Although Carlson pushed back at one point, saying Fuentes’s views are “against my Christian faith,” the overall tone of polite exchange allowed some listeners to interpret the discussion as a meeting of two legitimate positions rather than as a critical examination of ideas widely understood as bigoted.</p>\n\n<h2>Listening is not neutrality</h2>\n\n<p>One explanation for these differing interpretations comes from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976241239935\">a recent series of experiments</a> showing speakers often confuse “active listening” with agreement. Even when they had maintained eye contact and signaled attention using short phrases like “I see,” listeners who disagreed were consistently judged as worse listeners. Because people tend to assume their own views are correct, they often infer that anyone who disagrees must not have listened well.</p>\n\n<p>This psychological tendency complicates how the public interprets interviews like Carlson’s. Conversations can sound civil while failing to challenge harmful claims, leaving listeners with the mistaken belief that those claims are widely held.</p>\n\n<p>Listeners operating from a humanizing mode attempt to understand the person behind the belief, asking questions such as “When did you first encounter this idea?” or “What was happening in your life at the time?” or “What concerns does this belief address for you?” A decade ago, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/DEV-230345\">Dutch study</a>  found that extremist views often grow from fear, misinformation, isolation and a desire for belonging, along with other demographic, personality and social factors. Understanding those roots helps explain how individuals arrive at certain worldviews. </p>\n\n<p>But understanding is not the same as acceptance. Good listening does not have to signal agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of this kind of engagement exist outside politics. Former extremists such as <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/12/06/free-radicals-project-picciolini\">Christian Picciolini</a>, who founded the Free Radicals Project, and musician <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes\">Daryl Davis</a>, known for building relationships with members of the Ku Klux Klan, have shown that humanizing conversations can help people leave hate groups without normalizing the ideas those groups promote. Their work illustrates that it is possible to confront harmful beliefs while still recognizing the humanity of the people who hold them.</p>\n\n<h2>Moving beyond just calling out</h2>\n\n<p>The ongoing debate about Carlson and Fuentes also reflects a broader tension in terms of how society responds to harmful speech. </p>\n\n<p>Calling someone out, usually in public, focuses on blame. “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/12/03/1061209084/loretta-j-ross-what-if-we-called-people-in-rather-than-calling-them-out\">Calling someone in</a>,” a term developed by scholar and activist Loretta Ross, emphasizes private accountability and the possibility of correction. In a media setting, this might look like an interviewer saying, “I want to understand what you mean by that claim, because some viewers may hear it as targeting an entire group. Can you clarify how you see the people affected by this?” This approach challenges the idea while signaling curiosity about the speaker’s reasoning.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist commentator, appeared at a Donald Trump campaign event in 2020.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707280/original/file-20251209-56-msvxnd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Right-wing podcaster Nick Fuentes has had occasional differences with Donald Trump, but the president defended the decision by commentator Tucker Carlson to interview him.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Election2024TrumpYe/dab53cb00c014acba5edf8a0d7c32ee3/photo?vs=false\">Jacquelyn Martin/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>A similar approach, <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/calling-people-forward-instead-of-out-ten-essential-steps/\">described by authors Justin Michael Williams and Shelly Tygielski</a>, is known as “calling forward.” This framework focuses less on correcting a single remark, less on past mistakes and more on future growth by inviting reflection about how a belief fits within a person’s broader values. In practical terms, calling forward means setting clear boundaries around unacceptable beliefs while still recognizing an individual’s potential to change.</p>\n\n<p>Using a “calling forward” approach, Carlson might have followed his mild pushback that Fuentes’s ideas are against his “Christian faith” by exploring how Fuentes understands the tension between his political claims and widely held moral or religious principles. </p>\n\n<p>By stating directly when a claim is false or discriminatory but still allowing the conversation to explore how someone came to that belief, the interview places the idea in a fuller social and psychological context. The emphasis shifts to curiosity paired with accountability, and it can encourage someone to examine the roots and consequences of their beliefs without framing the exchange as a clash between equal positions.</p>\n\n<p>Most people will never interview a national figure or decide whether to put an extremist on camera. Ideally, most of us won’t be faced with the burden of listening to views that question our or others’ humanity. </p>\n\n<p>Even so, each of us likely has a relationship with someone who holds a belief we find troubling. More broadly, families, classrooms and community groups all face moments when someone introduces an idea that others find threatening.</p>\n\n<p>The Carlson–Fuentes interview has become a flash point partly because it forces a public reckoning with a private question: What is the cost of engagement, and what is the cost of refusing it? Understanding that distinction requires paying attention not only to who is invited to speak, but also to how the ways in which we listen fundamentally shape the conversation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269883/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Graham Bodie does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Government analysts expect <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/electricity-prices-demand-to-continue-rising-in-2026-eia/805395/\">prices will continue to rise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65284\">outpace inflation in 2026</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/income-inflation-economy-ae72499ff0de2e0251061ff3a502228b\">household earnings basically flat when adjusted for inflation</a>, these increases hit consumers hard. They take up <a href=\"https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/electricity-affordability-101/\">higher percentages of household expenses</a> – <a href=\"https://www.aceee.org/topic-brief/2024/05/combined-energy-burdens-estimating-total-home-and-transportation-energy-burdens\">especially for lower-income households</a>. Electricity prices have <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\">effects throughout the economy</a>, both directly on consumers’ budgets and indirectly by raising operating costs for business and industry, which pass them along to customers by raising prices for goods and services.</p>\n\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n\n<p>By 2030, energy analysts expect U.S. electricity demand to <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow\">rise about 25%</a>, and McKinsey estimates that data centers’ energy use could nearly triple from current levels by that year, using <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power/\">as much as 11.7%</a> of all electricity in the U.S. – more than double their current share.</p>\n\n<p>The nation’s current electricity grid is not ready to <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow\">supply all that energy</a>. And even if the electricity could be generated, transmission lines are aging and not up to carrying all that power. Their capacity would need to be <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/policy/queued-need-transmission\">expanded by about 60%</a> by 2050. </p>\n\n<p>Orders of key generating equipment often <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/supply-chain-delays-rising-equipment-prices-threaten-electricity-grid-269448\">face multiyear delays</a>. And <a href=\"https://cleanenergygrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ACEG_Grid-Strategies_Fewer-New-Miles-2025_Rev-1.pdf\">construction of new and expanded transmission lines</a> has been very slow.</p>\n\n<p>A Brattle Group analysis estimates all that new and upgraded equipment could cost <a href=\"https://www.brattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Transmission-Landscape-and-Outlook-Proactive-Planning-for-a-More-Cost-effective-and-Affordable-Energy-Transition.pdf\">between US$760 billion and $1.4 trillion</a> in the next 25 years.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"noQrq\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/noQrq/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The reasons</h2>\n\n<p>The enormous scale of the work needed is a result of a lack of investment over time and delays in the investments that have been made.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2019-07-19/in-unanimous-vote-n-h-supreme-court-upholds-northern-pass-denial\">since at least 2011</a> there has been an effort to bring <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/11/21/massachusetts-healey-hydro-quebec-clean-energy\">Canadian hydropower to the New England electricity grid</a>. Political opposition to cutting a path for a transmission line through forestland meant the project was subjected to a <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Question_1,_Electric_Transmission_Line_Restrictions_and_Legislative_Approval_Initiative_(2021)\">statewide referendum in Maine</a> – and then a court case that <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/30/maine-high-court-cmp-power-corridor-unconstitutional\">overturned the referendum results</a>. During those delays, inflation raised the estimated price of the project by half, <a href=\"https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/tech/science/environment/massachusetts-ratepayers-to-pay-extra-512-million-for-transmission-line-for-canadian-hydropower/97-9cec56b3-d0e5-4281-b8d4-533b69c3555c\">from $1 billion to $1.5 billion</a> – an added cost that will be paid by Massachusetts electricity customers.</p>\n\n<p>That multiyear effort is just one example of how the vast web of companies that generate power, transmit it from power plants to communities, and distribute it to homes and businesses complicates attempts to make changes to the power grid.</p>\n\n<p>State and federal government agencies have roles in these processes. <a href=\"https://www.naruc.org/about-naruc/our-mission/regulatory-commissions/\">States’ public utilities commissions</a> oversee the utility companies that distribute power to customers. The <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/what-ferc-does\">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> oversees connections of power generators to the grid and the transmission lines that move electricity across state lines.</p>\n\n<p>Often, those efforts aren’t aligned with each other, leading to delays over jurisdiction and decision-making. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, as new generators prepare to operate, whether they are solar farms or gas-fired power plants, they need permission from FERC to connect to the transmission grid. The commission typically requests <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/explainer-interconnection-final-rule-2023-A\">technical engineering studies</a> to determine how the project would affect the existing system. Delays in this process increase the timeline and cost of development and postpone adding new capacity to the grid. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"QyVDb\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QyVDb/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The costs</h2>\n\n<p>A key question for regulators and consumers alike is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/data-centers-need-electricity-fast-but-utilities-need-years-to-build-power-plants-who-should-pay-271048\">who should pay for adding more electricity</a> to the grid and making the system more reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Utilities traditionally <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-your-electric-bill-may-be-paying-for-big-data-centers-energy-use-257794\">charge customers for the costs</a> of generating and delivering power. And it’s not clear <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/data-centers-need-electricity-fast-but-utilities-need-years-to-build-power-plants-who-should-pay-271048\">how much power the data centers</a> will ultimately require.</p>\n\n<p>Some large data centers have taken to paying to <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/data-center-frontiers/navigating-us-data-center-energy-demand\">build their own on-site power plants</a>, though often they can <a href=\"https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2025/07/Data-Centers-Overview-Deck.pdf\">supply energy to the grid</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>In some states, efforts have begun to address public concern about electricity bills. In November 2025, two utility commissioners in Georgia, who had consistently approved electricity rate hikes over the previous two years, were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/georgia-election-utility-board-results.html\">voted out of office in a landslide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>New Jersey’s Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has pledged to <a href=\"https://newjerseyglobe.com/campaigns/sherrill-says-shell-freeze-utility-bills-in-first-year-as-governor/\">declare a utility-price emergency</a> and freeze costs for a year.</p>\n\n<p>In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul has paused implementation of state law, driven by environmental concerns, requiring that all new buildings over seven stories tall <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S4006/amendment/C\">only use electricity</a> and not natural gas or other energy sources. Hochul has said that requirement would <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ny-all-electric-building-law-delayed\">increase electricity demand too much</a>, raising prices and making the grid less stable.</p>\n\n<p>In Massachusetts, Gov.

New ideas like this need careful scrutiny and possible revisions to ensure they are effective at lowering costs and increasing reliability.</p>\n\n<p>As the country grapples with the effort to upgrade the grid, perform long-deferred maintenance and build new power plants, consumers’ costs are likely to continue to rise, further increasing pressure on Americans. Existing regulations and government oversight may no longer lower electricity costs immediately or help people plan for the rising costs over the long term.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271465/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Barbara Kates-Garnick receives funding from \n\nI received funding from the Mass Clean Energy Center through Tufts University for a grant on Offshore wind..\nI serve on the board of Resources for the Future</span></em></p>",

After more than two decades in this field, I wasn’t surprised to hear someone minimize the abuse of adolescents. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517742149\">My research</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2019.101750\">the work of other researchers</a> across the country have shown that victims who disclose their abuse are often met with disbelief and blame.</p>\n\n<p>What did surprise me was how the viral <a href=\"https://people.com/melissa-gilbert-addresses-megyn-kelly-comments-on-epstein-girls-shares-little-house-experience-i-was-15-11850450\">#iwasfifteen hashtag</a> shed light on the dynamics of abuse, pointing to the vulnerabilities that traffickers exploit and the harms they cause.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Abusive tactics in sex trafficking of minors</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike stereotypes of teens being kidnapped out of parking lots, people who traffic minors <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2019.1575315\">use a range of tactics</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-023-01419-7\">build relationships</a> with the teens and tweens they’re targeting. Getting young people to trust and depend on the traffickers is part of entrapping them.</p>\n\n<p>One in-depth 2014 analysis <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1079063214544334\">revealed these strategies in action</a>. Researchers looked at more than 40 social service case files of minors who were trafficked and interviewed social service workers.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers found it was common for traffickers to use flattery or romance to entrap adolescents. Some built trust with the teens by helping them out of difficult situations. Meanwhile, the traffickers normalized sex and prostitution as they isolated their victims from their friends and family – all of which echoes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-grooming.html\">the grooming described by victims of Epstein</a> and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>\n\n<p>The research also showed that traffickers kept tight control over the teens, using economic and emotional manipulation. They took their money, blackmailed and shamed them, and threatened harm if they were to leave. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67879225\">As in the Epstein case</a>, many traffickers compelled victims to take part in the trafficking itself, such as by recruiting their friends.</p>\n\n<p>The same kinds of manipulation show up in other studies nationally. A 2019 study found that across more than 1,400 cases, a third of traffickers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2019.1575315\">used threats and psychological coercion</a> to control victims. </p>\n\n<p>Another research team looked across <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15248380211025241\">23 studies of minors</a> who were sex trafficked in the United States and Canada. They found that the youth, who were mostly girls, were entrapped by traffickers who pretended to love or care for them, only to manipulate and abuse them.</p>\n\n<p>The tactics identified by researchers and the reports of how <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/jeffrey-epstein-island-where-virginia-giuffre-visitors-b2740242.html\">Epstein trapped victims on his island</a> reveal that all the strategies used by traffickers have one thing in common: They create ever more dependence of the victim on the trafficker.</p>\n\n<h2>Dependence and betrayal</h2>\n\n<p>Adolescence is a time of rapid change – change that traffickers exploit. From the tween through the teen years, young people are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15248380211025241\">forming their identities</a> and learning about romantic relationships, all while their brains are still developing. </p>\n\n<p>During this period of rapid change, they are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12678\">starting to differentiate</a> and seek autonomy. Yet they remain dependent on the adults in their lives for everything from their psychological needs, such as love, to basic physical needs, such as food and housing.</p>\n\n<p>When victims of trafficking depend – financially, psychologically or physically – on the very person abusing them, it’s a <a href=\"https://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/defineBT.html\">betrayal trauma</a>. In these scenarios, victims depend on the abuser, so they cannot simply leave the situation. Instead, they have to adapt psychologically.</p>\n\n<p>One way to adapt is to minimize awareness of the abuse – or what psychologists call <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674068063\">betrayal blindness</a>. In the short term, minimizing awareness of the abuse helps the victim endure the abuse. This could be the difference between life and death for a victim whose abuser might harm them if they try to leave or report the abuse – or for a teen who doesn’t have anywhere else to turn for basic survival.</p>\n\n<p>In the long term, though, betrayal traumas are linked with a host of harms that may affect how victims see themselves and the world around them. Compared with other kinds of traumas, betrayal traumas are linked to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1883925\">more severe</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260511421672\">psychological</a> and <a href=\"https://doi-org.du.idm.oclc.org/10.1177/0886260511421672\">physical health problems</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Betrayal trauma often leads to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0021576\">shame, self-blame and fear</a> and can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22530\">leave survivors alienated from</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032452\">distrusting of</a> others. Survivors may also be less likely to disclose abuse perpetrated by <a href=\"https://doi-org.du.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.11.001\">someone they trusted</a>. They may even have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09658210701256514\">difficulty remembering what happened to them</a>, which can worsen <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2017.1295421\">self-doubt and self-blame</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Making sense of the far-reaching impacts of betrayal trauma can be difficult for survivors – and others who hear their stories later.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709252/original/file-20251216-92-x5hj3u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"projected image of a woman holding a photo of her younger self.

Most people are regularly exposed to misinformation about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2019.1603531\">sexual violence and trafficking through popular media</a>, and that misinformation plays in the perpetrators’ favor.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers started <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.38.2.217\">documenting myths about intimate violence</a> decades ago. Since then, research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0023207\">erroneous views of rape</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10538712.2010.522493\">child abuse</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260514555369\">sex trafficking</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2019.1603531\">persist in media</a> – with consequences for victims.</p>\n\n<p>These myths and misconceptions often seep into the conversation unnoticed, such as when even well-intentioned reporting refers to the girls trafficked by Epstein as “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-myth-of-the-underage-woman/596140/\">underaged women</a>.” But calling tweens and teens “women” minimizes the age difference with the perpetrators. It also masks the vulnerability of children and adolescents who were victimized by adults.</p>\n\n<p>Myths can include beliefs that intimate violence is rare and always physically violent, and that victims all respond the same way. Myths also tend to minimize the perpetrator’s role while shifting blame to victims for what was done to them, particularly if victims had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2017.1406977\">mental health problems</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2012.06.002\">used substances</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Changing the conversation</h2>\n\n<p>With so many myths out there, #iwasfifteen showed one way to change the usual conversation from blaming victims to exposing the ways that abusers exploit tweens and teens. Meeting myths about sex trafficking with research is crucial to putting responsibility where it belongs, on those who traffic youth and perpetrate abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Research shows that the more people buy into myths, the more likely they are to blame victims or not believe them in the first place, including in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260514555369\">sex trafficking</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And it’s not only the unsuspecting public that falls for this misinformation. When victims don’t conform to common myths, even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000072\">law enforcement officers</a>, who are trained to investigate intimate violence, are less likely to believe them.</p>\n\n<p>In this way, the psychological consequences of betrayal trauma – from minimizing the abuse to psychological distress – can feed into myths that people have about intimate violence. Suddenly, it’s easier for friends, family, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211023485\">juries</a> and others to blame victims or not believe them at all.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, that’s what perpetrators have often told victims all along: No one will believe you. It’s not surprising, then, that victims may take years to come forward, if ever.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270349/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Anne P.

She notices it listing Wi-Fi networks she does not recognize, and the photos on her contact cards seem to mysteriously change at random times. One day she tries to make a call and just hears static on the line. She begins to think that someone – or an entire organization – has hacked her phone or placed spyware in it, and she wonders what crime she is being framed for.</p>\n\n<p>Built-in laptop webcams, unfamiliar Wi-Fi networks, targeted ads on search engines and personalized algorithms on social media sites: Most people have come to accept and ignore the quirks and drawbacks of daily contact with the internet and devices such as cellphones and computers. But for people with severe mental illness, new technologies are fertile ground for the start of false ideas that can lead eventually to a break with reality. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fsbDUsIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Psychiatrists like me</a> help people who are bothered by their thoughts, behaviors or emotional states. For the past 10 years I’ve been working closely with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443\">people who have schizophrenia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia, sometimes referred to as a type of thought disorder, is a chronic condition in which alterations in brain function change the way one perceives the world. People with schizophrenia can become <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.13\">hyperaware of their surroundings</a>, often interpreting things they see or hear as being hostile and directed toward them even when there’s no real danger.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, people with schizophrenia can develop <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/delusions-types\">delusions</a>: beliefs that are fully held even though they are not based in reality and even when there is evidence to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>With technology and the internet now such an integral part of daily life, it’s no wonder that people with schizophrenia have incorporated new technologies into their delusional beliefs. In my recent research, my colleagues and I set out to explore the ways modern tech influences the content of delusions for people today.</p>\n\n<h2>Old delusional themes expressed in new ways</h2>\n\n<p>Most delusions are persecutory, meaning a person believes they are being watched, followed or monitored. Other delusional forms involve the belief that a person has special powers, is being controlled by outside forces, or that a spouse is unfaithful even when they are not.</p>\n\n<p>Prior research has shown that these themes are consistent among people with schizophrenia, but the sociopolitical context in which a person lives shapes the form in which they are expressed.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Americans living during World War II developed persecutory delusions involving Germans, while those living <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764010396413\">during the Cold War focused on communists</a>. People with thought disorders have incorporated important events such as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1054/mehy.2000.1102\">fall of the Berlin Wall and the O.J. Simpson trial</a> into delusional frameworks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Surveillance camera with red lens glowing in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709086/original/file-20251216-62-1ga4xv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">New technologies offer new raw material for persecutory delusions to work with.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/surveillance-camera-glowing-in-the-dark-ominous-royalty-free-image/1459795167\">hernan4429/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The past three decades have seen incredible strides in technological advances and easy access to the internet. How have these old themes become repackaged and expressed in the digital age? </p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2025.10452\">this research</a>, my colleagues and I reviewed medical records of 228 people with thought disorders who participated in a specialized day treatment program between 2016 and 2024.</p>\n\n<p>We identified any mention of delusional thought content and examined the ways in which these beliefs incorporated new technology. We also analyzed the data to see whether certain people were more likely to express delusions tied to technology, or if there was a change in the frequency of these delusions over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Delusions of persecution via common tech</h2>\n\n<p>Over half of our study’s participants mentioned new technology or the internet when describing delusional beliefs. Most commonly, people felt they were being persecuted via their electronics – that their Wi-Fi networks, computers or cellphones had been hacked or implanted with tracking devices. One person reported believing that neighbors had access to their Wi-Fi network and were monitoring their activities, while another worried that family members had put tracking devices on their phone.</p>\n\n<p>About a quarter of participants reported delusional beliefs surrounding social media. For example, people believed that celebrities were communicating with them directly through social media posts, that they were receiving encoded messages through suggested playlists, or that social media algorithms were linked directly to their thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Some participants felt they were being monitored through hidden cameras or microphones implanted in their homes or even in their bodies. Several reported what’s known as the “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2012.666113\">Truman Show delusion</a>” – the belief that their lives are staged and recorded, their daily activities broadcast as a reality TV show.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"hand holds phone with emojis, hearts, likes etc rising in a cloud around it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/709180/original/file-20251216-72-kzo0rj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The universe of social media figured in a number of delusions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/cropped-hand-of-a-female-using-smartphone-on-social-royalty-free-image/1522417612\">d3sign/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>With each passing year of the 21st century, we found participants were significantly more likely to express delusions connected to technology.</p>\n\n<h2>Stretching the bounds of past realities</h2>\n\n<p>Our study confirms that common delusional themes, such as persecution, have become repackaged for the digital age. Interestingly, people often described fears that were based on misunderstanding how technology works – or fails to work. A Wi-Fi router that needed to be reset, a familiar app with a new logo, and text messages that disappeared over time were all cause for suspicion. </p>\n\n<p>The issue that has become hardest for me to grapple with as a psychiatrist is how any of us can distinguish delusional beliefs from reality, given things we never could have imagined would be possible just 10 years ago are now commonplace. Although social media algorithms are not currently linked to our thoughts, is it such a stretch to imagine that in a few short years they may be?</p>\n\n<p>Given recent advances in AI, our collective perception of reality is likely to be further distorted in the years to come. We will all need to find ways to anchor ourselves in a common truth and determine what’s real – and what isn’t.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271620/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alaina Vandervoort Burns does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This compares with 336 school shootings in 2024, 352 in 2023, 308 in 2022, and 257 in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>How this relates to an increase in schools trying to institute security measures to prevent shootings is an open question. But it’s true that many schools are experimenting with certain <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5317647/school-shooting-industry\">solutions</a>, like cameras, drones, AI threat detection, weapons scanners, panic apps and facial recognition, even if there is only <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/\">weak</a> or emerging evidence about how well they work.</p>\n\n<p>Schools are treated as the front line, because the larger, structural solutions are too difficult to confront. It is much easier to blame schools after a tragedy than to actually address firearm access, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/03/nation/what-drives-mass-shooters-grievance-despair-anger-are-more-likely-triggers-than-mental-illness-experts-say/\">grievance pathways</a> – meaning how a person becomes a school shooter – and the other societal problems that are creating these tragedies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How have schools responded to the rise of school shootings in recent years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Schools are being asked to solve a societal gun violence problem that they didn’t create and they cannot control. Even the best-run school cannot eliminate all risks when causes accumulate outside of their purview. These attacks are rare but catastrophic, and they create an impossible mandate for schools because when they occur, schools are told it reflects a failure in their preparation. Educators are expected to be teachers, social workers, threat assessors and first responders. It normalizes fear and shifts the responsibility downward.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/hbo-original-documentary-thoughts-prayers-debuts-november-18\">growing school safety industry</a> that markets fear as a solvable, technical problem. It promises faster ways to detect weapons, for example, but the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/10/opinions/school-shootings-ai-artificial-intelligence-security-riedman/\">evidence base</a> for those products is thin, proprietary or nonexistent. One example is an AI detection software that <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/doritos-or-gun\">mistook a bag of Doritos for a gun</a>, resulting in a large police response.</p>\n\n<p>Schools are pressured to buy something from these companies to show they are doing something. But some of these systems create false positives, and, more importantly, they shift attention away from human relationships. Technology alone cannot resolve grievances, replace trust and create belonging, but most schools are focused on technology as a means of prevention. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How effective are other prevention systems schools have put in place?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>If a school shooter is an outsider trying to attack the building, having a single point of entry, access control or multiple locks on doors creates time and space, which are essential for delaying an attacker until law enforcement can arrive, thus mitigating casualties.</p>\n\n<p>But the evidence shows that nearly all school shooters are either <a href=\"https://www.theviolenceproject.org/k12-schoolhomicides/\">current or former students</a> at the school. They are very familiar with entry and exit points, and they are potentially already inside the building before the school can act on a potential threat of violence.</p>\n\n<p>So, what happens if a school locks down, but you are actually locking the shooter in a room with their potential victims? What if students are forced to hide when it would be safer to run? What if you have a door that locks only from the inside and a student or staff member uses that room to bully or sexually assault another student? We’re building schools to protect against the rare events, but we are not mitigating the more common problems they face.</p>\n\n<p>Students are being asked to practice preventing their own deaths in active shooter drills and learn in environments designed around worst-case scenarios. In general, interpersonal violence and spillover of community violence, like gang-related shootings, are <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2812306?guestAccessKey=8eea46f0-4c80-408d-9e19-4def3e4a7ec0&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=112723\">the most common form of school shooting</a>. Most shootings at schools occur in parking lots or at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/34685039/rise-gun-violence-school-sports\">sports events</a>, but we do very little to prepare for those types of scenarios.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any benefits, then, to schools having certain non-tech safety measures in place, like making sure every person has an ID?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, you don’t want strangers walking around in a school building. The fact that someone coming to the school has to get their ID scanned and wear a badge makes perfect sense, not just to prevent shootings but to also prevent theft and assaults and other risks.</p>\n\n<p>The paradox is that school shooters tend to be children already affiliated with the school, and when someone walks in already firing, checkpoints and metal detectors are useless. Historically, several <a href=\"https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/\">mass shootings in K-12 schools</a> have started outside of the building then moved inside. The issue is not slipping past barriers but overwhelming them in seconds with irresistible force.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of people stand in a circle together and hold candles.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708919/original/file-20251215-56-6x1iwq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People hold candles and sing together on Dec. 14, 2025, at a vigil in Lippitt Memorial Park in Providence, R.I., for the recent mass shooting at Brown University.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/providence-ri-vigil-goers-hold-candles-and-sing-together-in-news-photo/2251461307?adppopup=true\">Ben Pennington/The Boston Globe via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Absent policy change, what is the clearest way to prevent school shootings, according to current evidence?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evidence shows that we often see <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785799\">signs of a crisis or withdrawal</a> beforehand from school attackers. And that is why school-based <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/ntac\">behavioral threat assessment and management</a> is so important. It is really about noticing changes in behavior and having the authority to intervene early. This is not about profiling people or relying on law enforcement alone. It is about having a structured, team-based process for identifying concerning behavior, assessing risk and coordinating appropriate supports – such as counseling – to prevent harm before it occurs. So often in these cases, people had a gut feeling that something was off with a particular student, but they didn’t know what to share or who to share it with.</p>\n\n<p>For decades we’ve invested far more in responding to school shootings once they occur rather than in preventing them. You can lock doors and run drills, but no school can become a fortress.</p>\n\n<p>Attackers leak warning signs in advance. Real prevention is about creating human systems that get upstream of this.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272140/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James Densley has received funding from the National Institute of Justice, the Joyce Foundation, and the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation.</span></em></p>",

Tit-for-tat tariffs and the scramble over rare earth elements has dampened <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-will-trumps-deal-with-xi-mean-for-the-us-economy-and-relations-with-china-expert-qanda-268688\">economic relations</a> between the world’s two leading economies. Meanwhile, territorial disputes between China and American allies in the Indo-Pacific region have further deepened the intensifying military rivalry. </p>\n\n<p>This rift has often been portrayed as a clash of opposing <a href=\"https://michaelmcfaul.substack.com/p/the-united-states-is-an-ideological\">ideological systems</a>: democracy versus autocracy; economic liberalism versus state-led growth; and individualism versus collectivism. </p>\n\n<p>But such framing relies on a top-down look at the two countries premised on statements and claims of powerful leaders. What it obscures is that both superpowers are administered by the same kind of professionals: career bureaucrats.</p>\n\n<p>We are an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pISbi-0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">international team</a> <a href=\"https://www.idos-research.de/en/heiner-janus/\">of researchers</a> <a href=\"https://www.idos-research.de/en/about-us/mark-theisen/\">investigating bureaucratic</a> <a href=\"https://www.idos-research.de/en/tim-roethel/\">preferences and behavior</a>. Earlier this year, we hosted a two-day <a href=\"https://www.idos-research.de/en/events/details/bureaucratic-aversion-to-criticism/\">workshop</a> with participants from China, the United States and other countries to compare bureaucratic agencies’ responses to global challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57938-8_10\">research</a> and that of <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-102543\">others</a> shows that, despite the ideological standoff at the leadership level, officials in China and the U.S. are shaped by comparable incentives and dynamics that lead them to act in surprisingly similar ways. In other words, when it comes to the women and men who carry out the actual work of government – from drafting regulation to enforcing compliance – China and the U.S. aren’t really that different.</p>\n\n<h2>Separated by politics, not practice</h2>\n\n<p>That’s not to suggest there aren’t differences in aspects of China’s and the U.S.’s bureaucratic base.</p>\n\n<p>China’s system is more centralized, with a larger civil service of around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-youth-flock-civil-service-slow-economy-puts-iron-rice-bowl-jobs-risk-2024-12-30/\">8 million employees as of 2024</a>. The U.S. bureaucracy is more decentralized across federal, state and local levels and employs fewer bureaucrats, with around <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CES9091000001\">3 million federal employees in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, comparative research on bureaucracies around the world shows that civil servants act similarly when confronted with complex problems, regardless of political system or policy field.</p>\n\n<p>Whether they are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GHJ8JL\">municipal bureaucrats in Brazil</a>, foreign aid officials in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107017\">Germany, Norway and South Korea</a>, or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqaf008\">international civil servants at the United Nations</a>, they all operate within the constraints of politically embedded organizations while pursuing their individual careers. In other words, they want to get ahead in their jobs while navigating constantly changing political winds.</p>\n\n<p>Bureaucrats in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055424000844\">U.S.</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0920203X241290653\">China</a> also navigate changing demands from their political leaders while seeking to gain expertise and progress in their careers.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing public expectations</h2>\n\n<p>Foreign aid, environmental management and pandemic governance in the U.S. and China provide telling examples of these parallels.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, the approaches of China and the U.S. to the use of foreign aid may appear as complete opposites. The former established the China International Development Cooperation Agency in 2018. Since then it has <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/chinas-pivot-to-small-and-beautiful-foreign-aid/\">expanded and evolved</a> its engagement abroad.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5451372/usaid-officially-shuts-down-and-merges-remaining-operations-with-state-department\">abolished USAID</a> earlier in 2025, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-donald-trumps-decision-to-slash-usaid-is-hurting-american-soft-power-and-making-the-world-less-safe-251062\">slashed</a> its foreign aid budget, and moved remaining staff members into the State Department.</p>\n\n<p>It would therefore seem that the U.S. and China are on opposing trajectories. Yet, the current moment obscures similarities between foreign aid bureaucrats in the two countries. Their tasks entail satisfying political objectives, overseeing taxpayer-funded projects abroad, and managing domestic public expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The expertise required of these bureaucrats is to increase their country’s “<a href=\"https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/what-soft-power\">soft power</a>” while avoiding the appearance of wasting scarce funds abroad amid looming domestic needs. </p>\n\n<p>With foreign aid admonished by the Trump administration as wasteful politics, officials in Washington are under unprecedented pressure to pursue financial diplomacy that recognizably serves <a href=\"https://godad.uni-goettingen.de/uploads/papers/Roethel_2025.pdf\">U.S. interests</a> while supporting foreign leaders whom the president considers allies. This agenda shift moves the U.S. closer to the Chinese foreign aid principle of seeking mutual benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Chinese aid officials are pivoting away from prioritizing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/china-laos-open-6-billion-high-speed-rail-link-2021-12-03/\">large-scale infrastructure projects</a> and toward a purported “<a href=\"http://en.cidca.gov.cn/pdf/InternationalDevelopmentCooperationChinasPracticeSmallandBeautifulProjects.pdf\">small but beautiful projects</a>” approach that centers on the well-being of beneficiaries. This pivot aligns their thinking with “softer” topics emblematic of U.S. foreign aid until 2024.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A sign saying USAID is seen behind glass.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708494/original/file-20251212-56-kbb7eg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Foreign aid practices in Washington and Beijing are converging.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/logo-is-seen-inside-the-headquarters-for-the-united-states-news-photo/2197166530?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Pete Kiehart for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The logic of blame avoidance</h2>\n\n<p>The case of bureaucratic responses to environmental pollution scandals is equally instructive. Again, one might expect bureaucrats in the U.S. and China, operating within different governance systems, to approach the problem differently. </p>\n\n<p>In practice, however, bureaucrats in both countries are often motivated by an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0143814X00004219\">urge to avoid blame</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than building on policy success stories, they tend to seek to deflect criticism for policy failures onto others. The underlying reason is so-called <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691129952/the-blame-game?srsltid=AfmBOopUHYZyVe5763tluGMFMyfbhpGgCzwxqXAxNEUVoKpoPaLyEKwg\">asymmetric payoffs</a>: Success stories may lead to short-term public acclaim; policy failures jeopardize entire careers.</p>\n\n<p>In China, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2024.2334711\">anti-air pollution measures introduced in Hebei province</a>, which borders the capital Beijing, provide a prime example of the logic of blame avoidance. When the central government in 2017 urged provincial officials to reduce air pollution by banning coal heating, the officials’ overzealous implementation was motivated by a desire to shield themselves from potential blame from national leadership. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the needs of Hebei residents were ignored, with schoolchildren shivering in unheated classrooms. Rather than assuming the blame, both national and local officials shifted the focus onto middle-class Beijing residents, who were pilloried in the media for prioritizing clean air over the well-being of others.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile in the U.S., the city of Flint, Michigan, had been reeling from decades of industrial decay and financial distress. The state government appointed an emergency manager who implemented cost-cutting measures, including switching the city’s water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River. This change resulted in lead contamination and widespread health impacts, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5942/jawwa.2016.108.0195\">escalating into a national scandal</a>. As in Hebei, all parties – from state regulators to local officials and environmental agencies – blamed each other in an attempt to avoid responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Careerism as constraint</h2>\n\n<p>Parallel bureaucratic behaviors also became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. In China and the U.S. alike, public officials worked at the forefront of implementing public health guidelines. The Chinese response was said to benefit from an “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11366-012-9204-4\">authoritarian advantage</a>,” allowing its authorities to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-021-08900-2\">impose drastic measures rapidly and comprehensively</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, evidence-based policymaking was <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8761023/\">constrained</a> by political preferences and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-022-00268-w\">bureaucratic careerism</a> – the drive of officials to prioritize actions that help them get promoted.</p>\n\n<p>It produced <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/spq.2024.11\">similar dynamics</a> to those observed in the more decentralized U.S. setting. In both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/722812\">China</a> and the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3961732\">U.S.</a>, bureaucrats were risk averse and anxious not to fall out with supervisors and political leaders.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A line of men in suits with masks on.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708493/original/file-20251212-66-8num0q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chinese bureaucrats faced the same constraints as their U.S. counterparts during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/chinese-security-officers-wear-protective-masks-as-they-news-photo/1215825556?adppopup=true\">Frayer/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Chinese approach resulted in a decrease in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115629\">public trust</a>, a phenomenon that has also been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7758/RSF.2022.8.8.08\">unfolding in the U.S</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And much <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2023.0125\">like their American counterparts</a>, Chinese bureaucrats initially scrambled together information from a cacophony of political and expert voices. This <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/mor.2020.29\">indecision blunted</a> their response to the viral outbreak in the decisive early days of the pandemic, even though it was eventually replaced by an official narrative emphasizing efficiency and success. In both systems, bureaucratic delays had detrimental consequences for public health.</p>\n\n<h2>An anchor of stability</h2>\n\n<p>Amid the heightened geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, it is important to remember that all powers rely on capable administrations to implement political directives. Politics set the tone, but bureaucrats shape reality. </p>\n\n<p>And the modus operandi of Chinese and American bureaucrats has remained strikingly stable over the years – driven primarily by incentives rather than ideology.

Binance has declined to comment on the case <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/hamas-attack-victims-sue-binance-allegedly-allowing-payments-militant-group-2025-11-24/\">but issued a statement</a> saying it complies “fully with internationally recognized sanctions laws.”</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution\">problem the Binance lawsuit touches upon</a> goes beyond U.S.-designated terrorist groups.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.albany.edu/rockefeller/faculty/nolan-fahrenkopf\">expert in countering the proliferation of weapons technology</a>, I believe the Binance-Hamas allegations could represent the tip of the iceberg in how cryptocurrency is being leveraged to undermine global security and, in some instances, U.S. national security. </p>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency is <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/coin-laundry/cryptocurrency-exchanges-binance-okx-money-laundering-crime/\">aiding countries</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100922718.pdf\">North Korea</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-sanctions-bessent-trump-treasury-cryptocurrency-ae2c2a274f19eccf0cc28dbf373ae25a\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/russias-use-of-crypto-schemes.html\">Russia</a>, and various <a href=\"https://www.trmlabs.com/resources/blog/category-deep-dive-use-of-crypto-in-terrorist-financing-expanded-in-2024\">terror-</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trmlabs.com/resources/blog/understanding-the-use-of-cryptocurrencies-by-cartels\">drug-</a>related groups in funding and purchasing billions of dollars worth of technology for illicit weapons programs.</p>\n\n<p>Though some <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-nationwide-actions-combat-illicit-north-korean-government\">enforcement actions</a> continue, I believe the Trump administration’s embrace of cryptocurrency might compromise the U.S.’s ability to counter the illicit financing of military technology.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, experts such as professor <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/justice-dept-says-it-will-pull-back-on-litigating-cryptocurrency-fraud/ar-AA1CwzB1?ocid=BingNewsBrowse\">Yesha Yadav</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/110820/how-congress-can-stop-crypto-crash/\">professor Hilary J.

For example, in 2024 it was <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/n-korea-at-crossroads/north-korea-gets-half-its-foreign-currency-from-cyber-theft-u.s.-official\">thought that around 50%</a> of North Korea’s foreign currency came from crypto raised in cyberattacks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men in hoods sit in front of computer screens.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708934/original/file-20251215-56-ry92w6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Modern-day bank robbers?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/team-of-computer-hackers-coding-on-keyboard-hidden-royalty-free-image/1450584224?phrase=crypto%20terrorist&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A digital bank heist</h2>\n\n<p>In February 2025, North Korea <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/psa/2025/psa250226\">stole over $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency</a> from Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the United Arab Emirates. Such attacks can be thought of as a form of digital bank heist. Bybit was executing regular transfers of cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/learn/wallet/hot-vs-cold-crypto-wallet-what-is-the-difference\">from cold</a> offline wallets – like a safe in your home – to “<a href=\"https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/hot-vs-warm-vs-cold-which-crypto-wallet-is-right-for-me\">warm wallets</a>” that are online but require human verification for transactions.</p>\n\n<p>North Korean <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/how-social-engineering-sparked-a-billion-dollar-supply-chain-cryptocurrency-heist/\">agents duped</a> a developer working at a service used by Bybit to install malware that granted them access to bypass the multifactor authentication. This allowed North Korea to reroute the crypto transfers to <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/1-5-billion-bybit-heist-linked-to-north-korean-hackers/\">itself</a>. The funds were moved to North Korean-controlled wallets but then <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/psa/2025/psa250226\">washed repeatedly</a> through mixers and multiple other crypto currencies and wallets that serve to <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2025-06/Public-Alert-Cryptocurrency-Mixing.pdf\">hide</a> the origin and end location of the funds.</p>\n\n<p>While some <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/326900/spoils-1-5-billion-bybit-hack-traced-greek-crypto-exchange-report\">funds have been recovered</a>, many have disappeared. </p>\n\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/psa/2025/psa250226\">eventually linked</a> the attack to the North Korean cyber group <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2022/220418.pdf\">TraderTraitor</a>, one of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/north-korea-cyber-structure-alignment-2023/\">many</a> intelligence and cyber units engaging in <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/CTIIC/documents/products/North-Korean-TTPs-for-Revenue-Generation.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">cyberattacks</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Lagging behind on security</h2>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency is attractive <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/psa/2024/psa240903\">because of the ease</a> with which it can be acquired and transferred between accounts and various digital and government-issued currencies, with little to no requirements to identify oneself. </p>\n\n<p>And as countries such as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-fuelsrussian-shadow-trade-for-weapons-parts-1bfdc1a1\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0248\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"https://www.albany.edu/rockefeller/news/2023-countering-challenges-proliferation-financing\">North Korea</a> have become constricted by international sanctions, they have turned to cryptocurrency to both raise funds and purchase materials for weapons programs.</p>\n\n<p>Even stablecoins, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/\">promoted</a> by the Trump administration as safer and backed by hard currency such as the U.S. dollar, suffer from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/most-popular-cryptocurrency-keeps-showing-up-in-illicit-finance-71d32e5e\">extensive misuse</a> linked to funding illicit weapons programs and other activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional financial networks, <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Financingofproliferation/complex-proliferation-financing-sanction-evasion-schemes.html\">while not immune</a> from money laundering, have <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/proliferation-financing.html\">well-established safeguards</a> to help prevent money being used to fund illicit weapons programs.</p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/coin-laundry/cryptocurrency-exchanges-binance-okx-money-laundering-crime/\">recent analysis</a> shows that despite enforcement efforts, the cryptocurrency industry continues to lag behind when it comes to enforcing anti-money-laundering safeguards. In at least some cases <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/global-cryptocurrency-exchange-bitmex-fined-100-million-violating-bank-secrecy-act\">this is willful</a>, as some crypto firms may attempt to circumvent controls <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal/case/united-states-v-binance-holdings-limited-dba-binancecom\">for profit</a> motives, <a href=\"https://centerforneweconomics.org/publications/a-libertarian-vision-for-cryptocurrencies/\">ideological</a> reasons or <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1395781/dl?inline\">policy disputes</a> over whether platforms can be held accountable for the actions of individual users.</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t only the raising of these funds by rogue nations and terrorist groups that poses a threat, though that is often what makes headlines. A more pressing concern is the ability to quietly launder funds between front companies. This helps actors avoid the scrutiny of traditional financial networks as they seek to move funds from other <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-korean-cargo-vessel-connected-sanctions-violations-seized-us-government\">fundraising efforts</a> or firms they use to <a href=\"https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/silicon-lifeline-western-electronics-heart-russias-war-machine/interactive-summary\">purchase equipment and technology</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bitbonkers.netlify.app/\">incredible number</a> of crypto transactions, the large number of centralized and <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi#:%7E:text=A%20beginner%27s%20guide%20to%20decentralized,peer%2Dto%2Dpeer%20manner.\">decentralized</a> exchanges and brokers, and <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/2025-Targeted-Upate-VA-VASPs.pdf.coredownload.pdf\">limited regulatory efforts</a> have made crypto incredibly useful for laundering funds for weapons programs.</p>\n\n<p>This process benefits from a lack of safeguards and “<a href=\"https://www.dowjones.com/business-intelligence/lp/kyc-aml\">know your customer” controls</a> that banks are required to follow to prevent financial crimes. These should, I believe, and <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/2025-Targeted-Upate-VA-VASPs.pdf.coredownload.pdf\">often do</a> apply to entities large and small that help move, store or transfer cryptocurrency known as <a href=\"https://www.trmlabs.com/glossary/virtual-asset-service-provider-vasp#what-are-the-key-functions-of-vasps-1\">virtual asset service providers</a>, or VASPs. However, enforcement has proven difficult as there are an incredibly large number of VASPs across numerous jurisdictions. And jurisdictions have <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/2025-Targeted-Upate-VA-VASPs.pdf.coredownload.pdf\">fluctuating</a> capacity or willingness to implement controls.</p>\n\n<p>The cryptocurrency industry, though <a href=\"https://bpi.com/despite-genius-act-crypto-pathways-remain-for-criminals-and-terrorists-to-exploit-u-s-financial-system/\">supposedly subject</a> to many of these safeguards, often <a href=\"https://amlwatcher.com/news/uk-fca-rejects-90-of-crypto-firms-for-aml-compliance-failures/\">fails to implement the rules</a>, or it evades detection due to its decentralized nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Digital funds, real risk</h2>\n\n<p>The rewards for rogue nations and organizations such as North Korea can be great.</p>\n\n<p>Ever the <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3413-1.html\">savvy sanctions evader</a>, North Korea has benefited the most from its <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/north-koreas-cryptocurrency-craze-and-its-impact-us-policy\">early vision</a> on the promise of crypto. The reclusive country has established an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/north-korea\">extensive cyber</a> program to evade sanctions that relies heavily on cryptocurrency. It is not known how much money North Korea has raised or laundered in total for its weapons program using crypto, but in the past 21 months it has stolen at least <a href=\"https://www.worldecr.com/news/north-korea-stole-2-84b-in-crypto-over-21-months-allied-monitoring-team-reports/\">$2.8 billion in crypto</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0248\">Iran</a> has also begun relying on cryptocurrency to aid in the sale of oil linked to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/united-states-seeks-civil-forfeiture-cryptocurrency-associated-iranian-national-mohammad\">weapons programs</a> – both for itself and proxy forces such as the Houthis and Hezbollah. These efforts are fueled in part by <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/blog/inside-nobitex-how-irans-largest-crypto-exchange-fuels-sanctions-evasion-and-illicit-finance\">Iran’s own crypto exchange, Nobitex</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/21/cryptocurrency-farage-donor-used-for-russian-war-effort\">Russia</a> has been documented going beyond the use of crypto as a fundraising and laundering tool and has begun <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-fuelsrussian-shadow-trade-for-weapons-parts-1bfdc1a1\">using its own crypto to purchase</a> weapons material and technology that fuel its war against Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2>A threat to national security</h2>\n\n<p>Despite these serious and escalating risks, the U.S. government is pulling back enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5587071-trump-pardon-binance-founder-crypto/\">controversial pardon</a> of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao raised eyebrows for the signal it sends regarding U.S. commitment to enforcing sanctions related to the cryptocurrency industry. Other actions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fdic-says-banks-can-engage-crypto-activities-without-prior-approval-2025-03-28/\">such as deregulating</a> the banking industry’s use of crypto and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/08/cryptocurrency-fraud-unit-shut-down/82991750007/\">shuttering the Department of Justice’s crypto fraud unit</a> have done serious damage to the U.S.’s ability to interdict and prevent efforts to utilize cryptocurrencies to fund weapons programs.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has also committed to ending “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1395781/dl?inline\">regulation by prosecution</a>” and has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/g-s1-51799/trump-corporate-bribery-investigations\">withdrawn numerous investigations</a> related to failing to enforce regulations meant to prevent tactics used by entities such as North Korea. This includes <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0057\">abandoning an admittedly complicated legal case</a> regarding sanctions against a “<a href=\"https://info.arkm.com/research/understanding-tornado-cash\">mixer</a>” allegedly used by North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>These actions, I believe, send the wrong message. At this very moment, cryptocurrency is being illicitly used to fund weapons programs that threaten American security. It’s a real problem that deserves to be taken seriously.</p>\n\n<p>And while some enforcement actions do continue, failing to implement and enforce safeguards up front means that crypto will continue to be used to fund weapons programs. Cryptocurrency has <a href=\"https://humanprogress.org/the-promise-of-cryptocurrencyh-podcast-highlights/\">legitimate uses</a>, but ignoring the laundering and sanctions-evasion risks will damage American national interests and global security.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269060/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nolan Fahrenkopf is a research fellow at the Center for Policy Research at the University at Albany, which receives grants related to nonproliferation from the U.S. Department of State and Department of Energy.</span></em></p>",

Traditional grading is not always an accurate – or the best – way to demonstrate mastery and learning. </p>\n\n<p>Many college faculty across the U.S., as well as some K-12 teachers and districts, are currently experimenting <a href=\"https://www.centerforgradingreform.org/past-conferences/\">with different approaches</a> and models of grading – typically doing this work on their own but sometimes also in coordination with their schools. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of young people are seen from behind walking in front of lockers and carrying backpacks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708522/original/file-20251212-66-rmundn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">High school students walk down the halls of Bonny Eagle High School in Standish, Maine, in 2020.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/students-make-their-way-down-the-now-one-way-hallway-on-the-news-photo/1228459379?adppopup=true\">Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this idea now gaining steam?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scholars have been researching grades for many decades – there are <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/435971\">foundational papers</a> from the early 20th century that scholars today still discuss.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, alternative grading picked up steam in the past 15 to 20 years. Researchers like me have been focused on how grades affect learning. </p>\n\n<p>Grades have been found to decrease students’ <a href=\"https://courses.cs.duke.edu/spring23/compsci390/readings/Butler_Nisan_1986.pdf\">intrinsic motivation</a>, and an overemphasis on grades has been shown to alter learning environments at all levels, leading to academic misconduct – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00405841.2017.1308172\">meaning cheating</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Grades have also been <a href=\"https://wvupressonline.com/node/758\">shown to cultivate a fear of failure</a> among students, at all ages, and inhibit them from taking intellectual risks and expressing creativity. We want students to be bold, creative thinkers and to try out new ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there other challenges that alternative grading is trying to correct?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Grades <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Grading-for-Growth-A-Guide-to-Alternative-Grading-Practices-that-Promote-Authentic-Learning-and-Student-Engagement-in-Higher-Education/Clark-Talbert/p/book/9781642673814\">mirror and magnify</a> inequities that have always been a part of American educational systems.  </p>\n\n<p>Students who come from K-12 <a href=\"https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/tci_research/unequal-opportunities-fewer-resources-worse-outcomes-for-students-in-schools-with-concentrated-poverty/\">schools with fewer resources</a>, for example, often do not have many textbooks. They often have few, if any, <a href=\"https://prichardcommittee.org/access-to-advanced-coursework-data-outcomes/\">AP courses</a>. These students can develop what researchers call “<a href=\"https://mostpolicyinitiative.org/science-note/education-opportunity-gaps/\">opportunity gaps</a>.” They do not have the same educational opportunities that students at schools with more resources have.  </p>\n\n<p>When students from low-resourced high schools go to college, they can receive worse grades than kids who come from better-resourced schools receive – typically because of these opportunity gaps. </p>\n\n<p>Some people would say that this means these students with low grades are not ready  for college. In reality, the grades reflect these students’ past educational experiences – not their potential in college. Once those less-than-stellar grades appear on these students’ transcripts in their first and second years of college, it becomes really hard for students to hit milestones that they need to reach for particular majors. </p>\n\n<p>If we thought about learning a bit differently, those students might have a better shot at reaching their goals. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What do alternative grading models look like in practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of different grading approaches people are trying, but I would say in the past 10 to 15 years, the movement has really exploded and there is a lot of discussion about it throughout higher education. </p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/what-is-standards-based-grading-and-how-does-it-work/2024/09\">standards-based grading</a>, a biology teacher, for example, would set out a certain number of content- and skill-based standards that they want students to achieve – like understanding photosynthesis. The student’s grade is based on how many of those standards they show competency in by the end of the semester. </p>\n\n<p>A student could show competency in a variety of ways, like a set of exam questions, homework problems or a group project. It is not limited to one type of assessment to demonstrate learning. This grading approach acknowledges that learning is a deeply complicated process that unfolds at different rates for different students. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0j28w67h\">Other models</a> could look like offering <a href=\"https://www.graduateprogram.org/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-student-retakes/\">unlimited retakes on tests</a>. Students may have to qualify for the retake by correcting all of the questions they got wrong on a previous exam. Or, teachers set up new assignments that draw on older standards students have previously met, so students have a second shot.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stetson.edu/other/writing-program/resources/writing-intensive-courses/using-portfolios.php\">Portfolio-based grading</a> is common in the arts and in writing programs. A student has a lot of time to turn in an assignment and then get feedback on it from their teacher – but no grade. The student eventually puts together a portfolio with the best of their assignments, and the portfolio as an entirety receives a grade. </p>\n\n<p>Another method is <a href=\"https://emilypittsdonahoe.substack.com/p/what-is-ungrading-what-is-collaborative\">called collaborative grading</a>, or ungrading, where students don’t get grades throughout the semester. Instead, they get feedback from their teachers and complete self-assessments. At the end of the semester, the student and teacher collaboratively determine a grade. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is stopping alternative grading from becoming more widespread?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have been bursts of activity with grading reform over the past 100 years. The 1960s are a great example of such a period of activity. This is when gradeless colleges like <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.edu/our-learning-approach/narrative-evaluations\">The Evergreen State College</a> were founded. </p>\n\n<p>Social media has helped this <a href=\"https://www.centerforgradingreform.org/\">particular recent iteration</a> gain traction, as educators can more easily communicate with other people who are grading in different ways. </p>\n\n<p>We are seeing the beginnings of a movement where individuals are trying to do something on this issue. But the issue has not yet drawn together coalitions of people who agree they want change on grading. </p>\n\n<p>Alternative forms of grading have caught on in some private schools, and they have not gained traction in other private schools. The same is true with public schools. Some challenges include logistical support from administrations in K-12 and colleges, teacher buy-in and parental support – especially in K-12 settings. </p>\n\n<p>There is nothing more baked into the fabric of education than the idea of grades. Talking about reforming grading shakes this foundation a little, and that is why it is important to discuss what the alternatives are.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269066/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Rowe Eyler does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Studying how mice see has helped researchers discover unprecedented details about how individual brain cells communicate and work together to create a mental picture of the visual world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P5IKL5UAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I am a neuroscientist</a> who studies how brain cells drive visual perception and how these processes can fail in conditions <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab025\">such as autism</a>. <a href=\"https://haider.gatech.edu/\">My lab</a> “listens” to the electrical activity of neurons in the outermost part of the brain called the cerebral cortex, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-18-07079.1997\">large portion of which</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/7131.003.0038\">processes visual information</a>. Injuries to the visual cortex can lead to blindness and other visual deficits, even when the eyes themselves are unhurt.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the activity of individual neurons – and how they work together while the brain is actively using and processing information – is a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mapping-how-the-100-billion-cells-in-the-brain-all-fit-together-is-the-brave-new-world-of-neuroscience-170182\">long-standing goal of neuroscience</a>. Researchers have moved much closer to achieving this goal thanks to new technologies aimed at the mouse visual system. And these findings will help scientists better see how the visual systems of people work.</p>\n\n<h2>The mind in the blink of an eye</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers long thought that vision in mice appeared <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0042-6989(00)00081-x\">sluggish with low clarity</a>. But it turns out visual cortex neurons in mice – just like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2024.102656\">those in humans, monkeys, cats and ferrets</a> – require <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0623-08.2008\">specific visual features to trigger activity</a> and are particularly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11665\">selective in alert and awake conditions</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I and others have found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24311-5\">mice are especially sensitive to</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24311-5\">visual stimuli directly in front of them</a>. This is surprising, because mouse eyes face outward rather than forward.

For mice, a visual focus on what’s straight ahead may help them be more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.06.094\">responsive to shadows or edges</a> in front of them, helping them avoid looming predators or better <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.03.010\">hunt and capture insects for food</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the center of view is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155266\">most affected in aging and many visual diseases</a> in people. Since mice also rely heavily on this part of the visual field, they may be particularly useful models to study and treat visual impairment. </p>\n\n<h2>A thousand voices drive complicated choices</h2>\n\n<p>Advances in technology have greatly accelerated scientific understanding of vision and the brain. Researchers can now routinely record the activity of thousands of neurons at the same time and pair this data with real-time video of a mouse’s face, pupil and body movements. This method can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav7893\">show how behavior interacts with brain activity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s like spending years listening to a grainy recording of a symphony with one featured soloist, but now you have a pristine recording where you can hear every single musician with a note-by-note readout of every single finger movement.</p>\n\n<p>Using these improved methods, researchers like me are studying how specific types of neurons work together during complex visual behaviors. This involves analyzing how factors such as movement, alertness and the environment influence visual activity in the brain. </p>\n\n<p>For example, my lab and I found that the speed of visual signaling is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.02.009\">highly sensitive to what actions are possible</a> in the physical environment. If a mouse rests on a disc that permits running, visual signals travel to the cortex faster than if the mouse views the same images while resting in a stationary tube – even when the mouse is totally still in both conditions.</p>\n\n<p>In order to connect electrical activity to visual perception, researchers also have to ask a mouse what it thinks it sees. How have we done this?  </p>\n\n<p>The last decade has seen researchers debunking long-standing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00173\">myths about mouse learning and behavior</a>. Like other rodents, mice are also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/im-a-neuroscientist-who-taught-rats-to-drive-their-joy-suggests-how-anticipating-fun-can-enrich-human-life-239029\">surprisingly clever</a> and can learn how to “tell” researchers about the visual events they perceive through their behavior. </p>\n\n<p>For example, mice can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3560-13.2013\">learn to release a lever</a> to indicate they have detected that a pattern has brightened or tilted. They can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.08.047\">rotate a Lego wheel left or right</a> to move a visual stimulus to the center of a screen like a video game, and they can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50340\">stop running on a wheel</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2020.00104\">and lick a water spout</a> when they detect the visual scene has suddenly changed.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Mouse drinking from a metal water spout\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708526/original/file-20251212-56-ccqnav.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Mice can be trained to drink water as a way to ‘tell’ researchers they see something.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mouse-drinking-from-a-spout-royalty-free-image/178825439\">felixmizioznikov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Mice can also use visual cues to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.038\">focus their visual processing</a> to specific parts of the visual field. As a result, they can more quickly and accurately respond to visual stimuli that appear in those regions. For example, my team and I found that a faint visual image in the peripheral visual field is difficult for mice to detect. But once they do notice it – and tell us by licking a water spout – their subsequent responses are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14355-4\">faster and more accurate</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These improvements come at a cost: If the image unexpectedly appears in a different location, the mice are slower and less likely to respond to it. These findings resemble those found in studies on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00335558008248231\">spatial attention in people</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My lab has also found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01888-4\">particular types of inhibitory neurons</a> – brain cells that prevent activity from spreading – strongly control the strength of visual signals. When we activated certain inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of mice, we could effectively “erase” their perception of an image. </p>\n\n<p>These kinds of experiments are also revealing that the boundaries between perception and action in the brain are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02114-x\">much less separate than once thought</a>. This means that visual neurons will respond differently to the same image in ways that depend on behavioral circumstances – for example, visual responses differ if the image will be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1787-x\">successfully detected</a>, if it appears <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.06.001\">while the mouse is moving</a>, or if it appears <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav3932\">when the mouse is thirsty or hydrated</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how different factors shape how cortical neurons rapidly respond to visual images will require advances in computational tools that can separate the contribution of these behavioral signals from the visual ones. Researchers also need technologies that can isolate how specific types of brain cells carry and communicate these signals.</p>\n\n<h2>Data clouds encircling the globe</h2>\n\n<p>This surge of research on the mouse visual system has led to a significant increase in the amount of data that scientists can not only gather in a single experiment but also publicly share among each other.</p>\n\n<p>Major national and international research centers focused on <a href=\"https://brain-map.org/\">unraveling the circuitry of the mouse visual system</a> have been leading the charge in ushering in new optical, electrical and biological <a href=\"https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/\">tools to measure large numbers of visual neurons</a> in action. Moreover, they make <a href=\"https://brain-map.org/atlases#mouse\">all the data publicly available</a>, inspiring <a href=\"https://mouse.digital-brain.cn/projectome/pfc\">similar efforts around the globe</a>. This collaboration accelerates the ability of researchers to analyze data, replicate findings and make new discoveries.</p>\n\n<p>Technological advances in data collection and sharing can make the culture of scientific discovery more efficient and transparent – a major <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2023.1276407\">data informatics goal</a> of neuroscience in the years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>If the past 10 years are anything to go by, I believe such discoveries are just the tip of the iceberg, and the mighty and not-so-blind mouse will play a leading role in the continuing quest to understand the mysteries of the human brain.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268334/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bilal Haider receives funding from NIH and the Simons Foundation.\n</span></em></p>",

Most of them, like the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station</a> and the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\">Hubble Telescope</a>, reside in low Earth orbit, or LEO, which tops out at about 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. </p>\n\n<p>But as more and more satellites are launched into LEO – SpaceX’s <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/us/technology?srsltid=AfmBOopP2hblyCkWtysw_pLf8vJRubmFxkCnRiGSF-rLGgWBKGCzCdlr\">Starlink internet constellation</a> alone will eventually <a href=\"https://keeptrack.space/deep-dive/starlink-vs-the-world/\">send many thousands more there</a> – the region’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbm9XBCK4\">getting a bit crowded</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why it’s fortunate there’s another orbit, even closer to Earth, that promises to help alleviate the crowding. It’s called <a href=\"https://redwirespace.com/capabilities/vleo/\">VLEO, or very low Earth orbit</a>, and is only 60 to 250 miles (100 to 400 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. </p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ckQTyHoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">engineer and professor</a> who is developing technologies to extend the human presence beyond Earth, I can tell you that satellites in very low Earth orbit, or VLEO, offer advantages over higher altitude satellites. Among other benefits, VLEO satellites can provide <a href=\"https://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via/december-2025/a-closer-look-at-vleo-the-new-frontier-in-orbit\">higher-resolution images, faster communications and better atmospheric science</a>. Full disclosure: I’m also a co-founder and co-owner of Victoria Defense, which seeks to commercialize VLEO and other space directed-energy technologies.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of VLEO</h2>\n\n<p>The images from very low Earth orbit satellites are sharper because they simply <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paerosci.2020.100619\">see Earth more clearly</a> than satellites that are higher up, sort of like how getting closer to a painting helps you see it better. This translates to higher resolution pictures for agriculture, climate science, disaster response and military surveillance purposes.  </p>\n\n<p>End-to-end communication is faster, which is ideal for real-time communications, like phone and internet service. Although the signals still travel the same speed, they don’t have as far to go, so latency decreases and conversations happen more smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>Much weather forecasting relies on images of clouds above the Earth, so taking those pictures closer means higher resolution and more data to forecast with.</p>\n\n<p>Because of these benefits, <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/45500_08-2025_workshop-session-on-transformative-science-technology-for-the-department-of-defense-operationalizing-very-low-earth-orbit#sectionEventMaterials\">government agencies</a> and <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/viridian-wins-1-25-million-afwerx-award-for-vleo-propulsion-technology/\">industry</a> are working to develop very low Earth orbit satellites. </p>\n\n<h2>The holdup: Atmospheric drag</h2>\n\n<p>You may be wondering why this region of space, so far, has been avoided for sustained satellite operations. It’s for one major reason: <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/impacts/satellite-drag\">atmospheric drag</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Space is often thought of as a vacuum. So where exactly does space actually start? Although about 62 miles up (100 kilometers) – known as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BBVCVHuKxhw?si=aw2OLolNMzpgyKG_\">the von Kármán line</a> – is widely considered the starting point, there’s no hard transition where space suddenly begins. Instead, as you move away from Earth, the <a href=\"https://eaglepubs.erau.edu/introductiontoaerospaceflightvehicles/chapter/international-standard-atmosphere-isa/\">atmosphere thins out</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2Te1gF-kxQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Where space begins is relatively arbitrary, but most consider it to be about 62 miles (100 kilometers) high.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In and below very low Earth orbit, the Earth’s atmosphere is still thick enough to slow down satellites, causing those at the lowest altitudes to <a href=\"https://alicja.space/blog/how-satellites-deorbit-kraksat-study\">deorbit in weeks or even days</a>, essentially burning up as they fall back to Earth. To counteract this atmospheric drag and to stay in orbit, the satellite must constantly propel itself forward – like how riding a bike into the wind requires continuous pedaling. </p>\n\n<p>For in-space propulsion, satellites use <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thruster\">various types of thrusters</a>, which provide the push needed to keep from slowing down. But in VLEO, thrusters need to be on all, or nearly all, of the time. As such, conventional thrusters would quickly run out of fuel. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, the Earth’s atmosphere in VLEO is still thick enough that atmosphere itself can be used as a fuel.</p>\n\n<h2>Innovative thruster technologies</h2>\n\n<p>That’s where my research comes in. At Penn State, in collaboration with Georgia Tech and funded by the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about\">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, our team is developing a new propulsion system <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/charge-harmony\">designed to work at 43 to 55 miles up</a> (70 to 90 kilometers). Technically, these altitudes are even below very low Earth orbit – making the challenge to overcome drag even more difficult. </p>\n\n<p>Our approach collects the atmosphere using a scoop, like opening your mouth wide as you pedal a bike, then uses high-power microwaves to heat the collected atmosphere. The heated gas is then expelled through a nozzle, which pushes the satellite forward. Our team calls this concept the <a href=\"https://news.engr.psu.edu/2025/bilen-sven-darpa-vleo-grant.aspx\">air-breathing microwave plasma thruster</a>. We’ve been able to demonstrate a prototype thruster in the lab inside a vacuum chamber that simulates the atmospheric pressure found at 50 miles (80 km) high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is relatively simple, but it holds potential, especially at lower altitudes where the atmosphere is thicker. Higher up, where the atmosphere is thinner, spacecraft could use different types of VLEO thrusters that others are developing to cover large altitude ranges. </p>\n\n<p>Our team isn’t the only one working on thruster technology. Just one example: The U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with defense contractor <a href=\"https://idstch.com/space/darpa-otter-program-unlocking-the-future-of-space-operations-with-air-breathing-electric-propulsion-technologies/\">Red Wire</a> to develop <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/otter\">Otter</a>, a VLEO satellite with its version of atmosphere-breathing thruster technology.</p>\n\n<p>Another option to keep a satellite in VLEO, which leverages a technology I’ve worked on throughout my career, is to tie a lower-orbiting satellite to a higher-orbiting satellite with a long tether. Although NASA has never flown such a system, the proposed follow-on mission to the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tss/\">tether satellite system</a> missions flown in the 1990s was to drop a satellite into much lower orbit from the space shuttle, connected with a very long tether. We are currently revisiting that system to see whether it could work for VLEO in a modified form.</p>\n\n<h2>Other complications</h2>\n\n<p>Overcoming drag, though the most difficult, is not the only challenge. Very low Earth orbit satellites are exposed to very high levels of <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190027587\">atomic oxygen</a>, which is a highly reactive form of oxygen that quickly corrodes most substances, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjyv7bK9X74\">even plastics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The satellite’s materials also must withstand extremely high temperatures, above 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius), because friction heats it up as it moves through the atmosphere, a phenomenon that occurs when all spacecraft <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jfhIKkRNKIY\">reenter the atmosphere from orbit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The potential of these satellites is driving research and investment, and proposed missions have become reality. <a href=\"https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/juniper-research-s-new-future-leaders-index-reveals-vleo-satellite-vendors-to-watch-as-market-develops/\">Juniper research</a> estimates that $220 billion will be invested in just the next three years. Soon, your internet, weather forecasts and security could be even better, fed by VLEO satellites.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258252/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sven Bilén founder and co-owner of Victoria Defense, which seeks to commercialize VLEO and other space technologies.

The <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/hegseths-war-department-escalates-review-of-mark-kelly-over-seditious-six-video\">threat of investigation</a> came after Kelly and five other Democrats, all with military backgrounds, <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1990774492356902948\">released a video</a> reminding U.S. service members they can disobey illegal orders issued by the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/democratic-lawmakers-urge-troops-to-disobey-illegal-orders\">the lawmakers said</a>, without specifying the orders the U.S. service members may have received. “Know that we have your back … don’t give up the ship.”</p>\n\n<p>In response to the video, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-democrats-death-penalty-sedition-military-orders-rcna245003\">President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers</a> of “seditious behavior” that could be “punishable by death.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2384\">Sedition is a federal crime</a>, but as <a href=\"https://lawschool.unm.edu/faculty/kastenberg/index.html\">a military law scholar</a> who served as a judge in the U.S. Air Force, I believe the Democratic lawmakers articulated a correct view of military law. That is, service members subject to the <a href=\"https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/UCMJ%20-%2020December2019.pdf\">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> have a duty to not obey unlawful orders. </p>\n\n<p>There are several unique features to military law that have no analog to civilian criminal law, and if Kelly were court-martialed he would be deprived of several fundamental constitutional rights. </p>\n\n<h2>Military justice</h2>\n\n<p>In a civilian criminal trial the government normally has the burden of proof on all matters. But in a court-martial, a service member who argues that an order is unlawful has the burden of proving its unlawfulness. And the Supreme Court, in its 1827 opinion in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/25/19/\">Martin v. Mott</a>, gave this view some credence, arguing that the president, as commander in chief, should <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6871&amp;context=lalrev\">not be questioned during a national emergency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, ordinary citizens are protected by <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt6-4-1/ALDE_00013124/\">a constitutional requirement</a> that the prosecution must convince all jurors of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <a href=\"https://www.militaryjusticeattorneys.com/blog/2017/may/what-exactly-is-a-court-martial-/\">A court-martial has only a two-thirds threshold</a> to establish guilt. And the jurors – called members – are not the accused service member’s peers.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the court-martial members are military personnel who outrank the accused service member and are picked to serve by senior commanding officers. Military judges are also uniformed officers and, like the rest of the military, are subject to the chain of command.</p>\n\n<p>At times, senior officers have inserted themselves into the military justice system and tried to direct a court-martial to convict an accused service member. This has created the problem of <a href=\"https://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/digest/VA1.htm\">unlawful command influence</a>, the improper use of superior authority to interfere with the court-martial process. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man speaks to another man wearing a white cap.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708883/original/file-20251215-56-nkaxyd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked the Navy secretary to review Kelly’s comments to troops for ‘potentially unlawful conduct.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ArmyNavyFootball/e45631e0c0574ffdbe612a6a3f796889/photo?vs=false&amp;currentItemNo=20&amp;startingItemNo=0\">AP Photo/Daniel Kucin Jr.</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Kelly is still theoretically subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and could be court-martialed because he is a military retiree. This concept of a lifetime military jurisdiction did not exist when the Constitution was instituted in 1789. It came into existence during an <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Dramatic_Session.htm\">emergency session of Congress in 1861</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court has never held that lifetime jurisdiction is constitutional. But in 2022 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did, <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/former-marine-challenges-power-of-courts-martial-to-try-military-retirees/\">in a 2-1 decision</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It reasoned that if the Constitution’s creators had thought such a jurisdiction were a threat to the republic, they would have prohibited it. The dissenting judge in that case pointed out the frightening possibility of a president using the Uniform Code of Military Justice <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/21-5012/21-5012-2022-08-02.html\">to curb free speech</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Lines of defense</h2>\n\n<p>Kelly is different than an ordinary retiree, and this case is bigger than a single senator. That’s because it goes to the heart of what the Constitution’s framers intended by preserving liberty through a republican form of government.</p>\n\n<p>In 1648, <a href=\"https://www.cromwellmuseum.org/cromwell/cromwell-the-man/lord-protector\">Oliver Cromwell</a>, who had become a military dictator over England, used the army to curb <a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/magna-carta/british-library-magna-carta-1215-runnymede/\">the Magna Carta</a> – a revolutionary basic rights document dating to 1215 – and the ability of Parliament to debate matters and pass laws. The Constitution is designed to prevent anything coming close to such an occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>So, what would Kelly’s defense likely be, other than that he exercised free speech and gave a correct recitation of the law? </p>\n\n<p>Kelly’s first defense might be that under the Constitution, the president, as commander in chief, has no power to court-martial or otherwise administratively penalize him. Doing so would diminish Congress’ authority.</p>\n\n<p>In 1974, the Supreme Court determined in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/208/\">Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee</a> that although <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C2-2/ALDE_00013137/\">the Constitution prohibits a member of Congress</a> from holding a position in the executive branch, citizens had no standing to sue in the federal courts to prevent this from occurring. Taken literally, the clause means that no member of Congress could hold a military commission and be beholden to the commander in chief, since this would erode Congress’ independence and authority.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly’s second defense could be that after the Constitution and statutory law, the military law is governed by tradition, or the military’s own past practices, which used to be referred to as “<a href=\"https://legal-resources.uslegalforms.com/l/lex-non-scripta\">lex non scripta</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>American history is replete with retired officers criticizing presidents or even joining in hate groups that accused a president of being beholden to subversive interests.

The federal judge assigned the case can then ponder whether siding with the administration’s claims is a step toward establishing a Cromwellian future and away from the Constitution’s protection of a republican form of government.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Congress could put a stop to any persecution of Kelly by informing the president that he is acting contrary to the Constitution and explaining to do so is a high crime or misdemeanor.</p>\n\n<p>During the Vietnam War, <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Military-Justice-Music-Robert-Sherrill-Harper/31887526469/bd\">scholar Robert Sherrill</a> said that “military justice is to justice what military music is to music.” In the past, military justice has been able to accomplish fair trials of military members, but it is dangerously open to influence by military leaders, all the way up to the commander in chief. </p>\n\n<p>If there is to be an exercise in accountability for Kelly, it could more fairly be administered through a real constitutional analysis conducted by the independent federal judicial branch – or through a congressional intervention. Without either occurring, we may as a nation find ourselves a closer step toward a Cromwellian future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271990/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Kastenberg does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And 1 in 3 take steps to cut their prescription drug costs, such as splitting pills when it’s not medically necessary or switching to an over-the-counter drug instead of the one that their medical provider prescribed.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/sramacha\">pharmacy professors</a> who <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/anpate.php\">research prescription drug access</a>, we think it’s important for Americans to know that it is possible to get prescriptions filled more affordably, as long as you know how before you go to the pharmacy.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Cost of copays ranges widely</h2>\n\n<p>When you have health insurance and have to pay for a prescription drug at the pharmacy, you’re usually <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-payment/\">covering the cost of your copay</a>. This is the amount patients or their caregivers are expected to pay after insurance covers the rest of the tab.</p>\n\n<p>If you get your <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-medicaid-and-americas-long-struggle-to-establish-a-health-care-safety-net-251776\">health insurance through Medicaid</a>, the government program that covers low-income Americans and people with disabilities, you should not have to pay anything at all to obtain prescription drugs. If there is a copay, it should be low – probably less than US$5. </p>\n\n<p>And if you’re <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/medicare-advantage-is-covering-more-and-more-americans-some-because-they-dont-get-to-choose-251796\">insured through Medicare</a>, the government program that mainly covers people who are 65 and older, or get your coverage through a private health insurance company, it’s important to understand what to expect when you visit a pharmacy.</p>\n\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://insuredandmore.com/what-is-the-average-out-of-pocket-cost-for-prescription-drugs\">private insurance companies charge US$5 to $50</a> for prescription drug copays. The copays are tiered based on what the drug costs. Brand-name and specialty medications have higher copays; older generics have lower copays. </p>\n\n<p>Some generic drugs and vaccines may even require no copay at all. While a copay is a flat fee, it can change over the course of the year based on whether or not you have met your deductible. The deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before your insurance starts covering your prescriptions. Before your deductible is fully paid, you may be responsible for the full cost of your medications. After you’ve met your deductible for the year, you will only be required to pay the copay.</p>\n\n<p>As newer, more expensive drugs enter the market, cost-sharing at the pharmacy has increasingly <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/no-surprises-act/2024-report-to-congress-prescription-drug-spending.pdf\">shifted from a copay to coinsurance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast with a flat copay, coinsurance means your insurance company will <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-insurance/\">cover a certain percentage</a> of the drug’s cost, and you’ll pay the rest. Since the patient’s share is based on a percentage of the medication’s price, coinsurance often results in <a href=\"https://phrma.org/blog/commercial-health-plans-transition-from-copays-to-coinsurance-and-deductibles-has-increased-patient-out-of-pocket-costs-for-brand-medicines\">higher out-of-pocket costs than copays do</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>New help for patients with Medicare coverage</h2>\n\n<p>Two new <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/explaining-the-prescription-drug-provisions-in-the-inflation-reduction-act/\">government programs</a> could help make prescription drugs more affordable for millions of older Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Starting in 2026, people who are insured through Medicare <a href=\"https://www.panfoundation.org/understanding-the-medicare-part-d-cap/\">will pay no more than $2,100</a> out of pocket on prescription drugs over the year. That cap may be much lower than $2,100 due to a quirk in Medicare’s rules. Prescriptions filled after someone has paid the maximum allowable amount will cost them nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the government launched the <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/publications/12211-whats-the-medicare-prescription-payment-plan.pdf\">Medicare Prescription Payment Plan</a> in 2025. This program, which is available to people over 65, helps spread what patients spend out of pocket on prescription drugs throughout the year, making that expense more predictable and easier to budget for.</p>\n\n<p>Early data indicates that <a href=\"https://advisory.avalerehealth.com/insights/early-enrollment-data-indicates-more-beneficiaries-could-benefit-from-mppp\">very few Americans are enrolled</a> in the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. Patients insured through private companies do not have similar opportunities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4NMOD0NMUc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=21\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Consumers should find out if they qualify for state or federal programs on their medications.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Coupons and discount cards</h2>\n\n<p>What if you can’t afford a copay for your prescription drug?</p>\n\n<p>Before giving up on ever getting it, ask the pharmacist about your options.</p>\n\n<p>It may be worth trying to use a free online tool, <a href=\"https://www.rxassist.org/\">such as RxAssist</a>, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, or a <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/\">discount card from GoodRx</a>, which is a publicly traded company.</p>\n\n<p>GoodRx cards are free. They help people compare local pharmacy prices and to locate coupons that <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/corporate/business/the-goodrx-effect-how-goodrx-is-changing-the-economics-of-healthcare\">make prescriptions more affordable</a>.</p>\n\n<p>GoodRx works by searching for the lowest available price for the prescription at various pharmacies. Other copay coupons provided by the drug manufacturer may also work similarly by lowering the cost of the medication. On some occasions, the cash price at the pharmacy may actually be cheaper than the copay, and the pharmacist should be able to help you navigate these options.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what you should know before giving GoodRx a try:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>GoodRx collects individual data on patients, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/ftc-enforcement-action-bar-goodrx-sharing-consumers-sensitive-health-info-advertising\">raising significant privacy concerns</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some pharmacies <a href=\"https://www.drugchannels.net/2020/08/how-goodrx-profits-from-our-broken.html\">do not accept GoodRx</a>. You may have to visit more than one pharmacy to be able to activate its discounts.</p></li>\n<li><p>These cards may make the most sense for uninsured or underinsured patients, but do not always help those who have insurance because you might not get a better price. What’s more, if you use a discount card, the amount you pay may not count toward your insurance deductible for the year.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You should weigh the caveats closely depending on your circumstance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A male pharmacist scanning a pharmacy product for his customer.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706837/original/file-20251207-56-1yh0ef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Your pharmacist can help you navigate the various discount offerings.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/an-asian-chinese-male-pharmacist-scanning-pharmacy-royalty-free-image/1214910646?phrase=prescription%20drug%20costs&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">CG Tan/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Prescription assistance programs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.novaregion.org/844/PAPs-Prescription-Assistance-Programs\">Prescription assistance programs</a> provide another cost-saving tool for Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Drugmakers, nonprofits and government agencies sponsor those programs, which help patients who are uninsured or underinsured – even if they are on Medicare – fill prescriptions either at a discount or for free.</p>\n\n<p>These programs include manufacturer-specific programs as well as charitable pharmacies like <a href=\"https://www.dispensaryofhope.org/\">Dispensary of Hope</a>, <a href=\"https://novascriptscentral.org/medhelp\">NOVA Scripts Central</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.patientadvocate.org/connect-with-services/\">Patient Advocate Foundation</a>. Qualifying criteria vary for these programs, but typically you must have a low income and be a citizen or a legal U.S. resident.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.panfoundation.org/\">Patient Access Network Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rxassist.org/\">RxAssist</a>, two nonprofits that help Americans pay their medical bills, also offer helpful tools to identify programs that could work for you.</p>\n\n<p>Assistance from these programs could cut your copay or even provide a prescription drug at no cost.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, the Trump administration announced in November 2025 that a new White House prescription drug pricing program will soon begin to connect consumers to companies that have agreed to sell certain prescription drugs at a big discount.</p>\n\n<p>Many experts don’t expect the program, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/\">known as TrumpRx</a>, to help people who have health insurance. Instead, it could be most likely to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/trump-rx-lower-costs-glp-1s-prescription-drugs\">help those with no insurance at all</a>. The new government program is slated to begin to roll out in 2026.</p>\n\n<h2>Direct-to-consumer models</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond coupons and assistance programs, a more radical shift is in the works: <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/direct-to-consumer-drug-costs-pharma-analysis/\">direct-to-consumer platforms</a> and cash-payment models.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, several manufacturers offered to sell medications directly to patients on websites and patient portals at cash prices. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/eli-lilly-prices-zepbound-weight-loss-drug-vials.html\">drug manufacturer Eli Lilly is offering</a> its popular weight-loss medication, Zepbound, <a href=\"https://www.lilly.com/lillydirect/medicines/zepbound\">on its website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These websites have out-of-pocket costs that can run upward of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/eli-lilly-prices-zepbound-weight-loss-drug-vials.html\">$300 a month</a>, making them too high for many, if not most, Americans to afford. And insurance companies have so far refused to cover them.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, the systems underlying these programs are still being built. We believe that the Trump administration would need to make a bigger effort to make it easier for millions of Americans to be able to afford filling their prescriptions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268067/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sujith Ramachandran received funding from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and provides consulting services for the National Community Pharmacists Association for work related to this topic.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adam Pate does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

These voters – found to be largely younger, male and lower-middle class – <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cz0xpvvjp4eo\">are seen as lacking a strong ideological identity</a> and rejecting politics altogether. </p>\n\n<p>The verdict delivered by Chile’s voters puts it in line with a broader right-wing regional shift – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/1-in-5-bolivians-spoiled-their-ballots-a-sign-of-voter-dissatisfaction-as-nation-tips-to-the-right-263166\">most recently in Bolivia</a> – that has reversed the <a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/pink-tide-south-america-politics-economy/\">“pink tide” of left-leaning governments</a> in the past two decades. But as a <a href=\"https://vancouver.labs.wsu.edu/andra-chastain/\">historian of modern Latin America and Chile</a>, I believe Chile’s election also reflects the important local context of years of increasing disenchantment with the political system. </p>\n\n<p>Amid Chile’s expanded electorate, the primary issues of voter concern during this campaign were crime and immigration.

Immigration has also risen significantly, with a large number of immigrants coming to Chile having fled economic and political crises in <a href=\"https://rimap.unhcr.org/countries/chile\">Venezuela, as well as in Peru, Haiti, Colombia and Bolivia</a>. The foreign-born population in Chile rose from <a href=\"https://migracionesinternacionales.colef.mx/index.php/migracionesinternacionales/article/view/2145/1892#:%7E:text=Increasing%20numbers%20of%20people%20have%20migrated%20to,being%20an%20attractive%20beacon%20for%20international%20immigrants.\">4.4%</a> in 2017 to <a href=\"https://rimap.unhcr.org/countries/chile\">8.8%</a> in 2024. </p>\n\n<h2>The key constitutional context</h2>\n\n<p>Many commentators have highlighted the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chile-elections-kast-jara-boric-trump-immigration-57d95c1471ebbd828da4f82e57e9acf6\">stark polarization</a> of this election, with a Communist Party labor minister campaigning against the arch-conservative Kast, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/08/chile-jose-antonio-kast-father-nazi-party\">lauded the Pinochet dictatorship</a> under which his deceased older brother once served. But there is more to the story.  </p>\n\n<p>Some observers have drawn comparisons between Kast and other far-right Latin American leaders like Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, Javier Milei in Argentina and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. But Chile is not merely following the same far-right playbook of its neighbors.  </p>\n\n<p>In the weeks leading up to the runoff in Chile, both candidates moved toward the center. Jara vowed to expand the prison system to combat rising crime, while Kast – who had previously threatened expulsion of undocumented migrants – softened his tone to say they would be “invited” to leave. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Kast <a href=\"https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/la-metamorfosis-de-kast/\">learned from his previous failed attempts</a> at the presidency by speaking less about his controversial or <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-14/jose-antonio-kast-the-far-right-catholic-who-seduces-chile.html\">more socially conservative positions</a>. For example, he played down opposition to abortion under any circumstances. Chilean voters, in contrast, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1246748/public-opinion-abortion-chile/?srsltid=AfmBOopbQjFqEmAlWwRWfmSIr9c28VgWUTQROIJTJLqEWtYJ-cORU9pb\">overwhelmingly approve</a> of the limited abortion rights that were passed by Congress in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Yet beyond the campaign trail messaging, the results also reflect a structural fact of Chilean politics that mirror political realities of other parts of Latin America, and even globally. In every presidential election since 2006, Chileans have voted out the incumbency to swing to the opposing side of the political spectrum. With candidates barred from consecutive presidential terms, the pendulum has swung back and forth since the alternating presidencies of socialist Michelle Bachelet – 2006-2010 and 2014-2018 — and conservative Sebastián Piñera – 2010-2014 and 2018-2022.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Supporters at a political rally wave flags.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708926/original/file-20251215-56-xd3zmn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">At a José Antonio Kast rally in Santiago on Dec. 14, 2025, supporters wave various flags, including one depicting late dictator Augusto Pinochet.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/supporters-of-chiles-presidential-candidate-jose-antonio-news-photo/2251372783?adppopup=true\">Eithan Ambramovich / AFP vis Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/20/who-is-gabriel-boric-the-radical-student-leader-who-will-be-chiles-next-president\">Boric</a>, a former left-wing student leader, took office in 2022 following a wave of upheaval and popular protests over inequality in 2019-2020. In what was a historic moment, the country voted to begin a process of rewriting its Pinochet-era constitution, <a href=\"https://dev.nacla.org/news/2020/10/28/burying-pinochet\">which entrenched neoliberal economic policies</a> and limited the government’s capacity to confront inequality. The constitutional convention was made up of directly elected citizens, many of them from grassroots movements. </p>\n\n<p>Yet in a stunning reversal, the progressive constitution – which would have protected rights to nature, Indigenous rights and social rights – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/world/americas/chile-constitution-no.html\">was roundly defeated in a plebiscite in 2022</a>. Just over a year later, voters <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67745456\">similarly rejected a second attempt</a> to rewrite the constitution, albeit under a process that conservative parties helped shape. </p>\n\n<p>Boric’s approval ratings, already low, suffered from this failed constitutional process. More than the right-wing elections elsewhere in the region, this national context helps to explain Chile’s own conservative turn. </p>\n\n<h2>The ever-present discontent of voters</h2>\n\n<p>Even as the pendulum has swung back and forth in recent Chilean presidential elections, there are deeper continuities across the different Chilean governments in the 21st century. Important among them is generalized voter discontent with the political system. </p>\n\n<p>This has traditionally been expressed in popular protests, such as the student movements of 2006 and 2011 and the <a href=\"https://nacla.org/2019-10-28-santiago-metro-chile-protests/\">Estallido Social</a> – or Social Uprising – of 2019-2020 that were the largest protests since the return to democracy in 1990 and helped propel Boric to power. Public discontent was also expressed in the overwhelming vote to rewrite the constitution, which passed with 78% of the vote in 2020. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A massive crowd is shown from above during a protest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708870/original/file-20251215-56-ptl5ry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In this Oct. 25, 2019, photo, anti-government protesters fill Plaza de la Dignidad – Dignity Square – in Santiago, Chile, during a nationwide call for socioeconomic equality and better social services.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ChileStudentRevolt/b319f94730dd465787117c31d6135c4e/photo\">AP Photo / Rodrigo Abd, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even though the constitutional process was ultimately rejected by voters, this underlying discontent has not gone away. </p>\n\n<p>One of the recent signs of discontent with the political choices on offer was in the first round of voting on Nov. 16: The third-place candidate was not one of the veteran politicians on the right, but Franco Parisi, a populist economist who has not set foot in Chile in years and who called on his supporters to intentionally vote null – <a href=\"https://press.umich.edu/Books/N/None-of-the-Above3\">or “spoil” their votes</a>. Discontent has taken many forms – outrage about inequality and neoliberalism in 2019-2020, or unease about economic precarity and crime in the current election. But it has persisted, even as Chile’s political system remains stable.</p>\n\n<p>Some observers have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-11-17/chile-s-right-turn-in-election-matters-less-than-its-democracy-s-stability\">pointed out</a> that, unlike in many places around the world, Chile’s democratic norms are holding strong. The fact that power continues to pass peacefully despite major ideological differences is significant, particularly in light of the <a href=\"https://uwpress.wisc.edu/Books/B/Bread-Justice-and-Liberty2\">long struggle for democracy</a> during the Pinochet regime. Kast’s style, for what it’s worth, is not as bombastic as that of U.S. President Donald Trump or Argentina’s Milei. </p>\n\n<p>Still, his apparent politeness belies what many fear is a coming erosion of rights: the <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251212-women-s-rights-seen-as-under-threat-as-chile-heads-to-polls\">rights of women</a> to bodily autonomy; the <a href=\"https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/jsForm/?File=/en/iachr/media_center/preleases/2024/093.asp\">rights of individuals</a>] to due process; the <a href=\"https://cut.cl/web/la-cut-se-manifiesta-frente-al-futuro-escenario-politico-haciendo-un-llamado-a-la-accion/\">rights of workers</a> to dignified conditions. These may well be up for negotiation under the new administration. </p>\n\n<p>Kast, a staunch Catholic and father of nine, is opposed to abortion under any circumstances and <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-14/jose-antonio-kast-the-far-right-catholic-who-seduces-chile.html#\">has even attempted to ban</a> the morning-after pill. He was a supporter of Pinochet up until the regime’s end, campaigning for the “yes” vote in 1988 that would have seen eight more years for the authoritarian leader after 15 years already in power. Kast has likewise vowed to slash public spending and deregulate the economy, <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/victims-of-the-chilean-miracle\">a clear echo of the Pinochet years</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the momentous shift heralded by Kast’s election, though, it is unlikely to change one of the principal challenges of Chile’s democracy in the 21st century: voter discontent and disenchantment. There has been a consistent trend for the government in power to lose popular support and face strong headwinds in Congress from the opposition. For all the celebration happening right now for Kast and his supporters, it is hard to see that changing once the new government takes office in March 2026.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272042/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andra B.

Most news articles ask a specific question – <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/22/who-is-in-epstein-emails/87355649007/\">which powerful men might be on “the list</a>”?</p>\n\n<p>Headlines focus on unidentified elites and who may be exposed or embarrassed, rather than on the people whose suffering made the case newsworthy in the first place: the girls and young women Epstein abused and trafficked.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the story is entering a new phase. A federal judge has authorized the Justice Department to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-grants-justice-department-request-to-release-ghislaine-maxwell-records-in-sex-trafficking-case\">unseal grand jury transcripts and other evidence from</a> Epstein companion Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking case. A court in Florida has cleared the release of grand jury records from a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/3rd-judge-grants-doj-motion-unseal-grand-jury/story?id=128280059\">federal investigation into Epstein</a> himself, all under the new <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/7-things-to-know-about-the-justice-departments-epstein-files?\">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>. Passed in November 2025, that law gives the Justice Department 30 days to release nearly all Epstein-related files. The deadline is Dec. 19. </p>\n\n<p>Journalists and the public are watching to see what those documents will reveal beyond names we already know, and whether <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/7-things-to-know-about-the-justice-departments-epstein-files\">a long-rumored client list</a> will finally materialize. </p>\n\n<p>Alongside that, there has been a stream of survivor-centered reporting. Some outlets, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/02/us/jeffrey-epstein-survivors-interview\">including CNN</a>, have regularly featured Epstein survivors and their attorneys reacting to new developments. Those segments are a reminder that another story is available, one that treats the women at the center of the case as sources of understanding, not just as evidence of someone else’s fall from grace.</p>\n\n<p>These coexisting storylines reveal a deeper problem. After the #MeToo movement peaked, the public conversation about sexual violence and the news <a href=\"https://opportunityagenda.org/messaging_reports/shifting-the-narrative/case-4/\">has clearly shifted</a>. More survivors now speak publicly under their own names, and some outlets have adapted. </p>\n\n<p>Yet long-standing conventions about <a href=\"https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/components_of_newsworthiness.html\">what counts as news</a> – conflict, scandal, elite people and dramatic turns in a case – still shape which aspects of sexual violence make it into headlines and which stay on the margins.</p>\n\n<p>That tension raises a question: In a case where the law largely permits naming victims of sexual violence, and where some survivors are explicitly asking to be seen, why do journalistic practices so often withhold names or treat victims as secondary to the story?</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-qiZT9dOFs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=11\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A “CBS Evening News” story from Dec. 12, 2025, teases the photos revealed by House Democrats of famous men with Jeffrey Epstein.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What the law allows – and why newsrooms rarely do it</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that government generally may not punish news organizations <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/469/\">for publishing truthful information</a> drawn from public records, even when that information is a rape victim’s name. </p>\n\n<p>When states tried in the 1970s and 1980s to penalize outlets that identified victims using names that had already appeared in court documents or police reports, the court said <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/florida-star-v-b-j-f/\">those punishments violated the First Amendment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Newsrooms responded by tightening restraint, not loosening it. Under pressure from feminist activists, victim advocates and their own staff, many organizations <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-006-9069-9\">adopted policies against identifying victims of sexual assault</a>, especially without consent. </p>\n\n<p>Journalism <a href=\"https://www.spj.org/spj-code-of-ethics/\">ethics codes now urge reporters to “minimize harm</a>,” be cautious about naming victims of sex crimes, and consider the risk of retraumatization and stigma. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, U.S. law permits what newsroom ethics codes discourage.</p>\n\n<h2>How anonymity became the norm and #MeToo complicated it</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Anti-rape culture protesters gathered in a crowd.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708844/original/file-20251215-56-jd2krw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The anti-rape movement in the U.S. forced newsrooms to revisit assumptions about whose voices should lead a story.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/hundreds-of-anti-rape-culture-protesters-gathered-in-thomas-news-photo/1043362588?adppopup=true\">Cory Clark/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For much of the 20th century, rape victims were routinely named in U.S. news coverage – a reflection of unequal gender norms. Victims’ reputations were treated as public property, while men accused of sexual violence were portrayed sympathetically and in detail.</p>\n\n<p>By the 1970s and 1980s, feminist movements drew attention to <a href=\"https://www.endsexualassault.org/history-of-the-sexual-assault-movement/\">underreporting and intense stigma</a>. Activists built rape crisis centers and hotlines, documented how rarely sexual assault cases led to prosecution, and argued that if a woman feared seeing her name in the paper, she might never report at all. </p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers passed “<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/rape-shield-law\">rape shield laws</a>” that limited the use of a victim’s sexual history in court. Some states went further by barring publication of victims’ names. </p>\n\n<p>In response to these laws, as well as feminist pressure, most newsrooms by the 1980s moved toward a <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2018/to-tell-the-stories-of-sexual-assault-victims-its-time-for-a-new-look-at-anonymity-policies/\">default rule of not naming victims</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, the #MeToo movement added a turn. Survivors in workplaces, politics and entertainment chose to speak publicly, often under their own names, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html\">about serial abuse and institutional cover-ups</a>. Their accounts forced newsrooms to revisit assumptions about whose voices should lead a story. </p>\n\n<p>Yet #MeToo also unfolded within existing journalistic conventions. Investigations tended to focus on <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2020/01/27/metoo-makes-difference-sex-crime-reporting-study-shows\">high-profile men</a>, spectacular falls from power and moments of reckoning, leaving less space for the quieter, ongoing realities of recovery, legal limbo and community response.</p>\n\n<h2>The unintended effects of keeping survivors faceless</h2>\n\n<p>There are good reasons for policies against naming victims. </p>\n\n<p>Survivors may face harassment, employment discrimination or danger from abusers if they are identified. <a href=\"https://media.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/files/media/documents/itu-unicef-guidelines-child-online-protection.pdf\">For minors</a>, there are additional concerns about long-term digital evidence. In communities where sexual violence carries intense social stigma, anonymity can be a lifeline.</p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=ucin1592171139720739&amp;disposition=inline\">research on media framing</a> suggests that naming patterns matter. When coverage focuses on the alleged perpetrator as a complex individual – someone with a name, a career and a backstory – while referring to “a victim” or “accusers” in the singular, audiences are more likely to empathize with the suspect and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0075\">scrutinize the victim’s behavior</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In high-profile cases like Epstein’s, that dynamic intensifies. The powerful men connected to him are named, dissected and speculated about. The survivors, unless they work hard to step forward, remain a blurred mass in the background. Anonymity meant to protect actually flattens their experience. Different stories of grooming, coercion and survival get reduced to a single faceless category.</p>\n\n<h2>A window into what we think is ‘news’</h2>\n\n<p>That flattening is part of what makes the current moment in the Epstein story so revealing. The suspense is less about whether more victims will be heard and more about what being named will do to influential men. It becomes a story about whose names count as news.</p>\n\n<p>Carefully anonymizing survivors while breathlessly chasing a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-pam-bondi-03fbcd024f631440f7ed62b3c6927db3\">client list</a> of powerful men unintentionally sends a message about who matters most. </p>\n\n<p>The Epstein scandal, in that framing, is not primarily about what was done to girls and young women over many years, but about who among the elite might be embarrassed, implicated or exposed.</p>\n\n<p>A more survivor-centered journalistic approach would start from a different set of questions, including wondering which survivors have chosen to speak on the record and why, and how news outlets can protect anonymity, when it is asked for, but still convey a victim’s individuality.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are not only about ethics. They are about news judgment. They ask editors and reporters to <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-powerful-and-privileged-how-misrepresentation-and-underrepresentation-disadvantaged\">consider whether the most important part of a story</a> like Epstein’s is the next famous name to drop or the ongoing lives of the people whose abuse made that name newsworthy at all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270244/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephanie A.

Young children stand alone in pods surrounded by 360-degree digital screens. Adults wander among the pods but do not talk to the students. Instead, each child interacts only with a sophisticated artificial intelligence, which peppers them with questions about everything from mathematics to philosophy. </p>\n\n<p>This is not the reality in today’s classrooms on Earth. For many technology leaders building modern AI, however, a vision of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo\">AI-driven personalized learning</a> holds considerable appeal. Outspoken venture capitalist <a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/\">Marc Andreessen, for example, imagines</a> that “the AI tutor will be by each child’s side every step of their development.”</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, I studied computer science and interned in Silicon Valley. Later, as a public school teacher, I was often the first to bring technology into my classroom. I was dazzled by the promise of a digital future in education.</p>\n\n<p>Now as a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mC5DDrIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">social scientist who studies how people learn</a>, I believe K-12 schools need to question predominant visions of AI for education.</p>\n\n<p>Individualized learning has its place. But decades of educational research is also clear that learning is a social endeavor at its core. Classrooms that privilege personalized AI chatbots overlook that fact.</p>\n\n<h2>School districts under pressure</h2>\n\n<p>Generative AI is coming to K-12 classrooms. Some of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/08/ai-takeover-education-chatgpt/683840/\">largest school districts</a> in the country, such as Houston and Miami, have signed expensive contracts to bring AI to thousands of students. Amid <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/05/arizona-public-school-closures-voucher-program/\">declining enrollment</a>, perhaps AI offers a way for districts to both cut costs and seem cutting edge. </p>\n\n<p>Pressure is also coming from both industry and the federal government. Tech companies have spent billions of dollars building generative AI and see a <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft-to-bring-ai-to-wa-classrooms-amid-urban-rural-tech-divide/\">potential market in public schools</a>. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/advancing-artificial-intelligence-education-for-american-youth/\">Republican</a> and <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/\">Democratic</a> administrations have been enthusiastic about AI’s potential for education.</p>\n\n<p>Decades ago, educators promoted the benefits of “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24385184?casa_token=BXhzwux1WvQAAAAA%3AyYw2yRSkjBpvYI6RLtLqhZ-v_Cf1nxV9RkDTrW6LzQKLRSHafyQnC5pY-wNcIoeDtJIsNQyR8i8tfAlX6c64pq-7uIj9pEtx19uQLPNjvmRb4eBB-SM&amp;seq=1\">One Laptop per Child</a>.” Today it seems we may be on the cusp of “one chatbot per child.” What does educational research tell us about what this model could mean for children’s learning and well-being?</p>\n\n<h2>Learning is a social process</h2>\n\n<p>During much of the 20th century, learning was understood mainly as a matter of individual cognition. In contrast, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X211047251\">latest science on learning</a> paints a more multidimensional picture.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists now understand that seemingly individual processes – such as building new knowledge – are actually deeply rooted in social interactions with the world around us. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2019.1633924\">Neuroscience research</a> has shown that even from a young age, people’s social relationships influence which of our genes turn on and off. This matters because gene expression affects how our brains develop and our capacity to learn. </p>\n\n<p>In classrooms, this suggests that opportunities for social interaction – for instance, children listening to their classmates’ ideas and haggling over what is true and why – can support brain health and academic learning. </p>\n\n<p>Research in the social sciences has long since proved the value of high-quality classroom discourse. For example, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40171413?seq=1+\">in a well-cited 1991 study</a> involving over 1,000 middle school students across more than 50 English classrooms, researchers Martin Nystrand and Adam Gamoran found that children performed significantly better in classes “exhibiting more uptake, more authenticity of questions, more contiguity of reading, and more discussion time.” </p>\n\n<p>In short, research tells us that rich learning happens when students have opportunities to interact with other people in meaningful ways.</p>\n\n<h2>AI in classrooms lacks research evidence</h2>\n\n<p>What does all of this mean for AI in education?</p>\n\n<p>Introducing any new technology into a classroom, especially one as alien as generative AI, is a major change. It seems reasonable that high-stakes decisions should be based on solid research evidence. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s one problem: The studies that school leaders need just aren’t there yet. No one really knows how generative AI in K-12 classrooms will affect children’s learning and social development.</p>\n\n<p>Current research on generative AI’s impact on student learning is limited, inconclusive and tends to focus on older students – not K-12 children. Studies of AI use thus far have tended to focus on either <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07356331251329185\">learning outcomes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/\">individual cognitive activity</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Although standardized test scores and critical thinking skills matter, they represent a small piece of the educational experience. It is also important to understand generative AI’s real-life impact on students.</p>\n\n<p>For example: How does it feel to learn from a chatbot, day after day? What is the longer-term impact on children’s mental health? How does AI use affect children’s relationships with each other and with their teachers? What kinds of relationships might children form with the chatbots themselves? What will AI mean for educational inequities related to social forces such as race and disability?</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, I think now is the time to ask: What is the purpose of K-12 education? What do we, as a society, actually want children to learn?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, every child should learn how to write essays and do basic arithmetic. But beyond academic outcomes, I believe schools can also teach students how to become thoughtful citizens in their communities. </p>\n\n<p>To prepare young people to grapple with complex societal issues, the <a href=\"https://naeducation.org/publication/educating-for-civic-reasoning-and-discourse/\">National Academy of Education</a> has called for classrooms where students learn to engage in civic discourse across subject areas. That kind of learning happens best through messy discussions with people who don’t think alike. </p>\n\n<p>To be clear, not everything in a classroom needs to involve discussions among classmates. And research does indicate that individualized instruction can also <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-nature-of-learning_9789264086487-en.html\">enhance social forms of learning</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So I don’t want to rule out the possibility that classroom-based generative AI might augment learning or the quality of students’ social interactions. However, the tech industry’s deep investments in individualized forms of AI – as well as the <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/what-past-education-technology-failures-can-teach-us-about-the-future-of-ai-in-schools-265172\">disappointing history of technology in classrooms</a> – should give schools pause.</p>\n\n<p>Good teaching <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2023.100536\">blends social and individual processes</a>. My concern about personalized AI tutors is how they might crowd out already infrequent opportunities for social interaction, further isolating children in classrooms. </p>\n\n<h2>Center children’s learning and development</h2>\n\n<p>Education is a relational enterprise. Technology may play a role, but as students spend <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/upshot/teachers-survey-chromebooks-class.html\">more and more class time on laptops and tablets</a>, I don’t think screens should displace the human-to-human interactions at the heart of education.</p>\n\n<p>I see the beneficial application of any new technology in the classroom – AI or otherwise – as a way to build upon the social fabric of human learning. At its best it facilitates, rather than impedes, children’s development as people. As schools consider how and whether to use generative AI, the years of research on how children learn offer a way to move forward.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269885/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Niral Shah does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This year, Trump has issued roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/trump-pardons-arrests\">1,800 pardons</a>, or nearly <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/11/24/the-meaning-of-trumps-presidential-pardons\">six times</a> the number he issued during the four years of his first term. Granted, about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-36809/trump-pardons-january-6-riot\">1,500 of them</a> involved individuals charged for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on Congress. Still, the pace of Trump’s pardons this year have been nearly unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>That is, until you remember his predecessor. Joe Biden, at the end of his term, issued a full and sweeping pardon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl3venz39o\">to his son Hunter</a> for gun and drug charges. This was an unprecedented action by a president to pardon his own child, which had never been done before. Biden also granted pardons to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-issues-pardons-to-his-family-members-in-final-act-in-office-citing-unrelenting-attacks-from-trump-and-allies\">several other family members</a> on his final day in office.</p>\n\n<p>Despite serving a single term, Biden <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/07/biden-granted-more-acts-of-clemency-than-any-prior-president/\">holds the record</a> for the most acts of clemency, or pardons combined with commuted sentences, of any president. It’s a record that’s not hard to imagine Trump could break.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JE3ThC0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">political scientist</a> who has studied pardons and other aspects of presidential power, I believe that the founders of our nation would be horrified by the contemporary use of the pardon power, which represents a far cry from the unifying act of mercy it was intended to be. While Biden issued pardons to family members, Trump has handed them out to political allies.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen whether this is a slight deviation from course or becomes a permanent pattern for all presidents in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>A clear break</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no question that Trump and Biden have acted within their authority in issuing pardons for federal offenses. Presidents can extend a pardon, or complete legal forgiveness of a crime, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/life/what-is-the-difference-between-a-pardon-clemency-and-commutation/BH2RGX6M6RC25BAD7YQZ7Z5H6Q/\">or a commutation</a>, which is the reduction of a sentence. However, individuals pardoned for federal crimes may still face peril in state courts.</p>\n\n<p>This extraordinary power may seem kinglike at first glance, but it was given to the president with a different vision in mind. The founders of the country viewed the pardon power not as a personal token for the president to hand out but as an act of mercy meant to <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2018-06-13/why-did-the-framers-give-the-president-a-pardon-power\">check the other two branches</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Hunter Biden leaves a federal courthouse in Los Angeles after pleading guilty on tax charges.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707504/original/file-20251209-76-ns9vs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">At the end of his presidency, Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter, who faced sentencing on gun and tax charges.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Trump-Pardons/5ced1fd9f61946c19f526556bd357633/photo?vs=false\">Eric Thayer/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>If Congress passed a law that the president believed was poorly written, or if the courts unfairly punished someone for breaking it, the president could step in and right the wrong. This was seen by the founders as a merciful act, stemming from the <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-history-of-the-pardon-power\">tradition of old English law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout American history, we have seen presidents mostly adhere to this pattern. Both Abraham Lincoln and his successor Andrew Johnson issued pardons and amnesty to <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/research/naturalization/411-confederate-amnesty-records.pdf\">former Confederate citizens</a>, with the aim of helping the nation come back together after secession and the Civil War. Harry Truman granted amnesty to certain <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/proclamations/3001/granting-amnesty-and-pardon-certain-persons-convicted-court-martial\">World War II deserters</a>, while Jimmy Carter granted pardons to hundreds of thousands of individuals who <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-21/president-carter-pardons-draft-dodgers\">dodged the draft</a> during the Vietnam War.</p>\n\n<p>But toward the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, presidents have used the pardon pen increasingly for personal and political reasons. The inflection point is undoubtedly the pardon of former President <a href=\"https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/digital-research-room/library-collections/topic-guides/nixon-pardon\">Richard M. Nixon</a> in 1974 by his former vice president and successor, Gerald Ford. This was issued a month after Nixon’s resignation in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.nixonfoundation.org/watergate-explained/\">Watergate scandal</a>, which involved Nixon’s 1972 reelection campaign spying on his political enemies. </p>\n\n<p>Ford <a href=\"https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/digital-research-room/library-collections/topic-guides/nixon-pardon\">justified his action</a> by citing the need for national unity, saying the pardon would spare the country from a messy and dramatic public trial of a former president. Never before had a high-profile public politician received such a presidential grant, which caused Ford’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/13/archives/fords-gallup-rating-off-21-points-after-pardon-unexpected-wounds.html\">public standing</a> to take a hit.

In 1992, George H.W. Bush pardoned officials he had served with in the Reagan administration who were tangled up in the arms-for-hostages, <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1224.html\">Iran-Contra scandal</a>; Bill Clinton pardoned Democratic <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121812&amp;page=1\">donor Marc Rich</a> in 2001; and George W.

During his first term, Trump also <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardons-paul-manafort-roger-stone-charles-kushner-more-allies/\">pardoned Charles Kushner</a>, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of his first term, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardons-paul-manafort-roger-stone-charles-kushner-more-allies/\">Trump pardoned</a> “”) his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his friend Roger Stone among other political allies.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s second term has seen clemency for his former lawyer and friend <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-pardons-2020-election-73348c1c5d2779741bf8af5b5ffb1472\">Rudy Giuliani</a>, as well as crypto executive <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/binance-pardon-trump-changpeng-zhao-crypto-rcna239371\">Changpeng Zhao</a>, whose ties to Trump family businesses have raised questions about the pardon.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s use of the pardon power does not seem to follow a consistent doctrine or philosophy. Some of his clemency actions seem to contradict his administration’s policy, such as dozens of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/07/trump-drugs-pardons-hernandez-venezuela/\">pardons of drug traffickers</a>, despite the effort to stop drug trafficking in the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>The pace of Trump’s pardons and commutations, however, suggests little hesitation. The question looking forward, beyond his presidency, is how much of a precedent his actions, along with Biden’s, may set for their successors.</p>\n\n<p>We know this from earlier expansions of the pardon’s reach, as well as other areas of presidential authority: Few presidents willingly relinquish powers accrued by their predecessors. Once chief executives have exercised a certain type of authority, their predecessors seldom give it back, ultimately <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/mah.2023.16\">increasing the power of the presidency</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271373/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stewart Ulrich does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This year, Black Friday alone saw consumers shell out <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-friday-shopping-spending-7f8b8e9244171333bfa6a7e8a91bffd0\">a record US$11.8 billion</a>. It’s the time of year when many Americans make purchases to decorate for the holidays — lights, ornaments and Christmas trees. </p>\n\n<p>If you bought a Christmas tree in Denver this year, you may have noticed a pretty steep price tag. It turns out that all <a href=\"https://observer.com/2025/11/trump-tariff-impact-chrismas-holiday-cost/\">festive products are getting more expensive</a>, and that includes Christmas trees, both freshly cut and artificial.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htD9S3gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I study the psychology of consumption</a> at the University of Denver. I’ve always been curious about how people make financial decisions under certain circumstances, including around the holidays. Christmas trees are an interesting case study.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s driving the increase</h2>\n\n<p>The cost of real Christmas trees is directly impacted by a long production cycle and transportation costs, particularly for landlocked markets like Denver. </p>\n\n<p>Christmas trees take <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/market-intel/real-christmas-trees-a-market-worth-supporting\">7 to 10 years to grow</a>. Currently, supply is tight, pushing tree prices up, which is a direct and delayed consequence of reduced planting <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/why-are-fewer-christmas-trees-growing-in-the-us-blame-the-great-recession/\">rates that followed the Great Recession – which began in late 2007</a>. This planting deficit effectively drove up wholesale prices and <a href=\"https://realchristmastrees.org/2020/04/06/the-real-story-about-the-price-of-christmas-trees-in-2019/\">doubled the average price of pre-cut trees over the past decade</a> after adjusting for inflation.  </p>\n\n<p>Raising tiny tree seedlings to a marketable size is a fraught business. Growers are exposed to a decade of weather, labor and pest risks, which increases the financial uncertainty of any planting season. This long lead time has made the supply unpredictable, putting constant pressure on Christmas tree wholesale prices.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Aerial view of rows of trees on a farm.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707917/original/file-20251210-56-s5sm88.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Colorado gets some of its Christmas trees from North Carolina, which grows more than 26% of the Christmas trees in the U.S.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/christmas-trees-are-farmed-in-the-small-town-of-newland-in-news-photo/2249827131?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Allison Joyce/GettyImages</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For Denver retailers, transportation adds disproportionately to the final cost, since most Christmas trees in Denver are <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-families-size-down-christmas-tree-prices-rise/\">brought in from the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina</a> using long-haul freight.</p>\n\n<p>A retailer in Denver must also cover local operational overhead, such as labor costs, storage and the rental of temporary sales lots, which <a href=\"https://www.christmastreesdenver.com/product-category/fresh-cut-christmas-trees/\">increases prices by about 10%</a> on average based on wholesale Christmas tree prices. This is especially true for large trees, those taller than 9 feet (2.74 meters), as they do not grow in Colorado. Having said that, there are Christmas tree growers in Colorado, and the <a href=\"https://realchristmastrees.org/education/tree-varieties/douglas-fir/\">Douglas Fir is native to Colorado</a> and grows <a href=\"https://csfs.colostate.edu/forests-trees/colorados-major-tree-species/\">naturally throughout its mountains</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Psychology of Christmas tree purchase decisions</h2>\n\n<p>The choice between a pre-cut Christmas tree and an artificial one is classic behavioral economics, which is the <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-behavioral-economics\">combination of economics and psychology to understand how and why people behave the way they do in the real world</a>. It involves a trade-off between two readily available choices.</p>\n\n<p>One option offers an emotional appeal, while the second choice may have to do more with cost savings and perceived environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>Buyers of real trees are driven by pleasure, satisfaction and emotional fulfillment. Often, buyers of fresh-cut trees are driven by nostalgia and a desire to inhale the powerful scent. Depending on the qualities of the tree, like how long it keeps its needles, how stiff the branches are and how rare it is, Denver customers often spend between <a href=\"https://www.christmastreesdenver.com/product-category/fresh-cut-christmas-trees/\">$50 and $870 annually</a> on fresh-cut Christmas trees. </p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, artificial tree buyers prioritize the ease of buying a tree at the store and then bringing it out of storage each year. These customers seek convenience, low maintenance and the ability to control how the tree looks from a product that can <a href=\"https://www.balsamhill.com/c/7-to-7-and-half-ft-artificial-christmas-trees\">cost between $250 to $700 initially</a>. Being a durable good, <a href=\"https://people.com/trump-tariffs-could-affect-christmas-tree-prices-11855599\">artificial trees are typically replaced only once every five years</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2025, however, the decision to buy an artificial tree may feel less rational.

Failed attempts to end the conflict date back to the beginning, soon after <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-against-ukraine-timeline/\">Russia’s 2014 occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas</a>. After Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, peace discussions started up again <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2022/03/russia-and-ukraine-talking-while-fighting/\">within days</a>, and they have <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-alaska-ukraine-trump-interactive/33503122.html\">continued in fits and starts since</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prospects for a lasting peace remain dubious. One reason, I believe, is that the proposals pay little attention to the relationship between peace and justice – a flaw shared by <a href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/lessons-of-the-minsk-deal-breaking-the-cycle-of-russias-war-against-ukraine/\">previous plans</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Is peace worth having if it’s unjust? Is justice worth pursuing if it prolongs war? Those are questions as troubling as they are old. “<a href=\"https://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa/summa.SS_Q29_A3.html\">Peace is the effect of justice</a>,” as St. Thomas Aquinas argued in the 13th century. Ceasefires built on coercion or exhaustion inevitably fail because they do not resolve the conflict’s causes. </p>\n\n<p>Aquinas is a major figure in the just war tradition, the focus of <a href=\"https://www.colgate.edu/about/directory/vmorkevicius\">my research</a>. This area of ethics helps weigh when war is justified – and also how it should end.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the  insight that peace and justice are inseparable grounds what international law terms “<a href=\"https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/TJ_Guidance_Note_March_2010FINAL.pdf\">transitional justice</a>.” By <a href=\"https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/43966/On-the-Peace-Negotiations-Between-Russia-and-Ukraine-Prioritising-the-Human-Dimension-DIGITAL.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y\">focusing on victims</a> and assuring <a href=\"https://www.ictj.org/what-transitional-justice\">accountability for past wrongs</a>, this approach seeks to disrupt recurring cycles of violence.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/05/minsk-conundrum-western-policy-and-russias-war-eastern-ukraine-0/minsk-1-agreement\">Past agreements and proposals</a> aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine failed because in the rush to stop the fighting, they ignored questions of justice. The literature on transitional justice, by contrast, encourages negotiators to <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/simon-skjodt-center/work/ferencz-international-justice-initiative/transitional-justice\">attend to four</a> <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24220123.pdf\">interdependent principles</a>: truth, justice, reparations and safeguards against future recurrence.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Truth</h2>\n\n<p>Truth is essential for peace. As St. Augustine, one of the earliest Christian just-war thinkers, put it in the fourth century, “<a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/aorlando/www/HT610Augustine/On%20Lying.pdf\">false justice</a>” arises when the pursuit of truth is abandoned.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in black clothes and a black hat leans over a coffin draped in sky blue fabric.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708242/original/file-20251211-70-jlppz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A mother cries at the coffin of her son, Oleh Borovyk, a Ukrainian serviceman, during his funeral in Boiarka, Ukraine, on Dec. 3, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/APTOPIXRussiaUkraineWar/3153c68a3e654916831f134882a79d41/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Durable peace agreements require all sides to cooperate with international efforts to document war crimes and human rights violations, such as the United Nations’ <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/iicihr-ukraine/index\">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine</a>. This is no small task. So far, Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2025/04/examen-de-lukraine-au-cat-les-experts-saluent-la-designation\">has granted access</a> to outside investigators, but Russia <a href=\"https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-moscow-mechanism-expert-report-on-the-treatment-of-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-by-the-russian-federation/\">has refused</a>, even when it has <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/A/80/497\">accused Ukraine</a> of war crimes.</p>\n\n<p>But reconciliation requires a complete accounting of the harms done. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who headed South Africa’s <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Truth-and-Reconciliation-Commission-South-Africa\">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> after the end of apartheid, explained that “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media/pr/1995/p951130a.htm\">forgiveness depends on repentance</a>, which has to be based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on disclosure of the truth.”</p>\n\n<p>Truth-telling also prevents false narratives from creating “justifications” for renewed fighting. Thus, peace in Ukraine will require a global effort to <a href=\"https://www.ictj.org/latest-news/truth-telling-ukraine-amid-widespread-disinformation-and-weakened-international-system\">combat disinformation</a> legitimizing Russia’s aggression and <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\">obscuring its war crimes</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Justice</h2>\n\n<p>Justice demands holding perpetrators to account. If, as Aquinas argued, a just war is “<a href=\"https://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa/summa.SS_Q40_A1.html?highlight=war&amp;queryID=58053827&amp;resultID=54071#highlight\">one that avenges wrongs</a>” or seeks “to restore what [has been] seized unjustly,” ignoring these concerns when ending a war would itself be unjust.</p>\n\n<p>Treating collaborators with fairness <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/271-fraught-path-forward-ukraines-liberated-territories\">requires nuance</a>. In some cases, pardoning individuals who acted under duress – and even willing but nonviolent collaborators who fully disclose their actions – can support <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17450144.2010.534496\">postwar reconciliation</a>. Especially in areas once occupied by enemy forces, frank confessions can help <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/commentary/blog/2024/difficult-journey-trust-conflict-affected-societies\">rebuild social trust</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, amnesty for war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href=\"https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/PCS%20S%202004%20616.pdf\">is impermissible</a> because pardons deny victims justice and may embolden future perpetrators. The <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/the-court\">International Criminal Court</a> has issued <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/situations/ukraine\">arrest warrants</a> for six Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, the Council of Europe has established a <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/special-tribunal-for-the-crime-of-aggression-against-ukraine-frequently-asked-questions\">Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression Against Ukraine</a>, which would prosecute senior Russian officials who ordered the <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2022/ga12407.doc.htm\">illegal invasion</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Realistically, neither forum can try those responsible without either Russia’s defeat or Putin’s removal from power.

Reparations</h2>\n\n<p>Reparations aim to make survivors whole again. This principle, too, has roots in classical just war thinking. The 16th-century theologian Francisco de Vitoria, for example, argued that reparations within the bounds of “<a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/vitoria-political-writings/on-the-law-of-war/0DE60772EAD74313205D69B888C2D2D6\">equity and humanity</a>” could help redress losses and restore justice.</p>\n\n<p>The World Bank estimates that direct damage in Ukraine is over US$176 billion; in total, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/02/25/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released#:%7E:text=The%20RDNA4%2C%20which%20covers%20damages,more%20than%202.5%20million%20households.\">rebuilding will cost three times that</a>. The Council of Europe has recommended using <a href=\"https://pace.coe.int/en/news/9369/frozen-russian-state-assets-should-be-transferred-to-a-new-fund-to-reconstruct-ukraine-says-pace-committee\">frozen Russian assets</a> to fund reconstruction efforts, as have some <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/use-russias-frozen-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine\">American scholars </a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/05/minsk-conundrum-western-policy-and-russias-war-eastern-ukraine-0/minsk-1-agreement\">hastily drafted</a> Minsk agreements, signed in <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/ua140905minskceasfireen.pdf\">2014</a> and <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/ua150212minskagreementen.pdf\">2015</a>, established <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine-closed\">a ceasefire monitoring mission</a> and required the removal of foreign military units. They also demanded Ukrainian constitutional reforms – ostensibly to secure more autonomy for the country’s largely Russian-speaking east. </p>\n\n<p>The Minsk agreements temporarily froze the conflict, but relative quiet didn’t mean peace. Ceasefire violations were perpetual. Russian-supported militias <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/dont-let-russia-fool-you-about-the-minsk-agreements/\">were not disbanded</a>, and Russia continued <a href=\"https://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/RAD290.pdf\">to send mercenaries</a> and <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/201503_bp_russian_forces_in_ukraine.pdf\">military forces</a> to the Donbas. Human rights violations <a href=\"https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/ReportUkraine-1Feb-31Jul2022-en.pdf\">proliferated in Russian-occupied areas</a>. And in February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Given this history, a durable peace would require that Russia accept constraints on its power. The <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/a456d6dd8e27e830/e279a252-full.pdf\">various peace proposals</a> put forth since 2022, however, have demanded security concessions only from Kyiv, requiring Ukraine to abandon hopes for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\">NATO membership</a> and restricting the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/unfinished-plan-peace-ukraine-provision-provision\">size of its military</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is unlikely to agree to caps on its military. Deterrence, then, could take the form of <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/iner/30/1/article-p1_2.xml?language=en&amp;srsltid=AfmBOooEVpLQoWPWhzIvQKRYdgIGLqQ8VCVAf2AMtqmg9W-jqS_Rif-i#CIT0009\">credible commitments</a> from other countries to enforce whatever peace agreement emerges. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine’s vulnerability to future Russian aggression means it will need <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-what-an-article-5-style-security-guarantee-might-look-like-263475\">binding promises</a> from its partners. Russia will not sign a treaty that permits Ukraine to join NATO, which Moscow claims would be a threat. Other possible safeguards for Ukrainian sovereignty include a proposed <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/guarding-frontier-options-post-conflict-security-force-ukraine\">international peacekeeping force</a> or an alternative set of <a href=\"https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/security-guarantees-ukraine-0\">security alliances</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Lasting peace</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, a durable peace requires considering both sides’ legitimate security and justice claims if, as Vitoria wrote in 1539, “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511840944.013\">they are prepared to negotiate genuinely and fairly</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Therein lies the catch. Transnational justice <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501705762/hijacked-justice/\">can be hijacked</a>, with aggressors trying to <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/weller-ukraine\">portray themselves as victims</a>. Separating fact from fiction, and genuine concerns from manufactured pretext, is essential at the negotiating table. </p>\n\n<p>A quick end to the war is tempting, but a hasty peace is a fragile one. A durable peace, rather than yet another ceasefire, requires attention to justice – even if that takes more time to achieve.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270638/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Valerie Morkevicius does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And over the long arc of my career, I watched the agency enact this mission in ways that brought enormous value to the country. NIH funding trained a legion of biomedical scientists, produced countless therapies that underpin much of modern medicine and catalyzed the launch of the biotechnology industry.</p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/nih-grant-cuts-have-disrupted-hundreds-clinical-trials-study-finds\">widespread federal grant terminations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/04/american-science-shattered-series-analyzes-trump-research-funding-cuts/\">disruptions to federal funding</a> in 2025 have left scientists who depend on NIH support reeling.

That laboratory had been established in 1887 to develop public health measures, diagnostics and vaccines for controlling diseases prevalent in the U.S. at the time, such as cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, plague and diphtheria.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the new NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., on Oct. 31, 1940, saying, ‘We cannot be a strong nation unless we are a healthy nation.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nihgov/24479778636/in/album-72157658704588971\">National Institutes of Health</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Sen. Joseph Ransdell of Louisiana envisioned the NIH as an agency with a broader mandate for translating scientific advances to improve human health. In arguing in 1929 for the creation of the new institute, he read into the Congressional Record an editorial from The New York Times that <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/70/crecb/1929/01/31/GPO-CRECB-1929-pt3-v70-4.pdf\">highlighted rapid advances</a> in chemistry, physiology and physics. </p>\n\n<p>The editorial lamented that “never in the whole history of the world had efforts to improve health conditions been behind the advance in other sciences.” Pointing to millions of Americans suffering from sickness leading to economic losses “into billions,” it argued for the need for a medical sciences institute coordinating “a national effort to prevent diseases that are or may be preventable.”</p>\n\n<p>In 1945, a report called <a href=\"https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2023-04/EndlessFrontier75th_w.pdf\">Science – The Endless Frontier</a>, by Vannevar Bush, highlighted the government’s central role in supporting science that harnessed nuclear energy, implemented radar and developed penicillin – all important elements of the United States’ success in World War II. Bush argued that these wartime successes presented a model for growing the American economy, preventing and curing disease and projecting American power.</p>\n\n<p>The NIH became central to this model. Its budget <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27375/w27375.pdf\">increased substantially during</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45556/\">just after World War II</a>, with postwar adoption of Bush’s plan, and again after 1957 when the nation redoubled its commitment to science following Russia’s launch of Sputnik and the start of the space race. The <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971\">National Cancer Act of 1971</a>, which established the separate National Cancer Institute, reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to government-funded research. This new institute’s funding provided much of the seed capital for the emergence of biotechnology.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1980s, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/senate-bill/1250\">Stevenson-Wydler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/committee-report/105th-congress/senate-report/358/1\">Bayh-Dole acts</a> created a clear pathway for developing commercial products from federally funded research that would provide public benefits and economic stimulus. These federal laws made it a requirement to pursue patenting and licensing of NIH-funded research to industry.</p>\n\n<h2>How one project’s evolution reflects the NIH’s mission</h2>\n\n<p>Today, the NIH represents the backbone of efforts to improve health and health care, supporting each step in the process from preliminary discovery to clinical advance.

R01 grants are the main mechanism that academic biomedical scientists in the U.S. rely on to support innovative research. </p>\n\n<p>Later, an <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes/P01\">NIH Program Project</a> grant enabled us to investigate how the genes we had identified could be used to treat children. A <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes/M01\">General Clinical Research Center grant</a> supported the hospital facilities necessary for clinical research and paid for patient care. Other grants supported our medical students and fellows as they embarked on their own careers as well as applications of our research to areas such as child health, reproductive biology and gastroenterology.</p>\n\n<p>As our research on gene therapy progressed, <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/funding/funding-categories/small-business\">NIH Small Business grants</a> contributed to our founding a company that raised US$200 million in investments and partnerships and created hundreds of new jobs in Houston.

      "content": "<p>More than 20% of Americans will be <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\">diagnosed with mental illness in their lifetimes</a>. They will, that is, experience conditions that influence the way they think, feel and act – and that may initially seem incompatible with the demands of work. </p>\n\n<p>Our new research suggests that what people living with chronic mental illnesses need most to succeed at work is for their managers to be flexible and trust them.</p>\n\n<p>This includes the freedom to adjust their schedules and workloads to make their jobs more compatible with their efforts to manage and treat their symptoms. For that to happen, managers need to trust that these workers are committed to their jobs and their employers. </p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D0iz6OYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=aop\">management</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Rz6pOIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">professors</a> who reviewed hundreds of blog and Reddit posts and conducted in-depth interviews with 59 people. And those are the most significant findings from our peer-reviewed study, published in the October 2025 issue of the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2023.0430\">Academy of Management Journal</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Scouring Reddit posts and conducting interviews</h2>\n\n<p>We gathered our data from three sources: anonymous blog posts from 171 people, Reddit posts from 781 people, and in-depth interviews with 59 workers employed in a variety of jobs across multiple industries.</p>\n\n<p>All these people worked while dealing with chronic mental illness, such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder. The blog posts were maintained by a nonprofit concerned with the experiences of individuals living with mental illness. We focused on posts tagged “work.”</p>\n\n<p>To identify relevant data on Reddit, we searched using a combination of the word “work” with several terms associated with mental illness. Additionally, we restricted our data collection to unsolicited narratives published prior to mid-March 2020 to avoid overlap with the employment changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because this data was gathered from the internet, we couldn’t obtain details about participants’ gender, age, profession or education. </p>\n\n<p>We also recruited people to interview through social media postings, advertising in a public university’s alumni listserv and contacting an organization that focuses on men’s mental health. We also made requests of those we’d already interviewed to see whether they had recommendations for other people to possibly interview.</p>\n\n<p>The interviews took place in 2020 and 2021.</p>\n\n<h2>Speaking with people from all walks of working life</h2>\n\n<p>About 37% of the people we interviewed identified as women, and their average age was 41.5 years. Approximately 80% of them identified as Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 3.5% Hispanic, and less than 2% identified as either Indian, Korean American, mixed race or Middle Eastern and North African. About 3.5% chose not to answer. </p>\n\n<p>They held a variety of jobs, including lawyer, professor, touring musician, consultant, teacher, real estate manager, chief technology officer, salesperson, restaurant server, travel agency manager, graphic designer, tester for manufacturing plant, chemical engineer and bus driver. Several worked in tech fields.</p>\n\n<p>When the employees who we studied were trusted and given flexibility, they became better able to do their jobs while also attending to their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Employees who had lived with their condition for years used what we call “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99803-x\">personalized disengagement and engagement strategies</a>” to manage their symptoms. That refers to the fact that people with mental illness respond best to different coping strategies depending on their own preferences and symptoms, instead of using generic techniques they learned from self-help resources or peers.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of personalized disengagement strategies ranged from leaving workspaces to meditate to taking a walk, to finding a quiet space to cry. </p>\n\n<p>Engagement strategies included immersing more deeply into work and having conversations with co-workers. These coping strategies will sound familiar to most people, including those without any chronic mental health conditions. But workplaces don’t always give employees, regardless of their disability status, the flexibility and self-determination necessary to enact their strategies. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.mindsharepartners.org/2025-mental-health-at-work-report\">recent survey by Mind Share Partners</a> found that nearly half of employees didn’t even feel like they could disconnect from their jobs after working hours or while on vacation.</p>\n\n<p>Many employees also told us that they benefited from trust and flexibility in the period after they were diagnosed, when they needed to explore different therapies and treatment techniques.</p>\n\n<p>When managers allow for flexibility, trust workers to do what they need to do to address their symptoms, and convey their compassion, employees with chronic mental illness are more likely to keep their jobs and get their work done. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Affecting most employers</h2>\n\n<p>Mental illnesses became more prevalent in the aftermath of COVID-19,<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/college-students-are-now-slightly-less-likely-to-experience-severe-depression-research-shows-but-the-mental-health-crisis-is-far-from-over-267606\">especially among</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13864\">adolescents and young adults</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So, if you’re an employer, chances are that our research is relevant to your workforce.</p>\n\n<p>Depression, a common mental illness, had an <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression#tab=tab_2\">estimated cost of US$1 trillion annually</a> in lost productivity in 2019, the World Health Organization has estimated.</p>\n\n<p>People with anxiety and mood disorders, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t8/\">bipolar disorder</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t5/\">major depressive disorder</a>, may periodically have symptoms that interfere with their ability to do their jobs.</p>\n\n<p>And while doing those jobs, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063221111758\">risk being stigmatized by co-workers</a> who may know little about mental illness or be judgmental about people with those chronic conditions. That adds <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2021.1998667\">further stress beyond what others would experience at work</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Employee assistance programs could be falling short</h2>\n\n<p>In response, many employers offer benefits to help employees cope with mental and emotional problems, such as <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/toolkits/managing-employee-assistance-programs-eaps\">employee assistance programs</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/admsci14060131\">mental-wellness app subscriptions</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appsy.2011.11.002\">stigma-reduction efforts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These one-size-fits-all initiatives can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1359432X.2017.1374245\">help improve functioning</a> for those with occasional or short-term emotional problems, and they can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000126\">help improve leaders’ ability to respond to employees’ distress</a>, which is crucial.</p>\n\n<p>But as a whole, they are not enough to solve the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Employee assistance programs, which <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/hr-magazine/companies-seek-to-boost-low-usage-employee-assistance-programs\">nearly all big companies offer</a>, have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrmr.2022.100941\">not proved systematically helpful to workers</a> in achieving their goals. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000018\">One study found</a> that they reduced employees’ absences but did not reduce their work-related distress.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11115-016-0344-4\">Another study</a> even found that workers who used these programs became more inclined to leave their jobs.</p>\n\n<h2>Not missing out on peak performers</h2>\n\n<p>Contrary to stereotypes, people with chronic anxiety and depression, such as those we studied, are generally as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2020.1867618\">capable of success in the workplace as anyone else</a> in the right context.</p>\n\n<p>Extremely high performers, such as the late actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/30/carrie-fisher-advice-column-mental-illness-bipolar-disorder\">Carrie Fisher</a> and the Olympic swimmer <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/michael-phelps-reflects-on-depression-and-mental-health-i-saw-it-as-a-sign-of-weakness-210641477876\">Michael Phelps</a>, are two such examples of people with a mental illness who were top achievers in their field. </p>\n\n<p>If you were a manager, wouldn’t you want people of this caliber working for you? If so, then it’s important to create the right conditions, which many <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/10/its-a-new-era-for-mental-health-at-work\">employers fail to do despite their best efforts</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Needing more mental health support</h2>\n\n<p>Companies will face increasing pressure to support those with mental illness and other mental health challenges.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://monsterworkwatch24.my.canva.site/monster-2024-state-of-the-graduate-report\">Monster’s 2024 State of the Graduate Report</a> found that Gen Z employees, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z\">people born between 1996 and 2010</a> and are currently in their teens and 20s, are increasingly prioritizing support for mental health at work, with 92% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed wanting a job where they are comfortable discussing their mental health at work.</p>\n\n<p>This trend suggests that employers wishing to attract top entry-level talent will need to effectively support mental health, highlighting the importance of continuing to research this issue.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270368/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They also show how legal reform and support networks designed to protect whistleblowers are critical for protecting accountability and democracy itself.</p>\n\n<h2>The limits of legal protections</h2>\n\n<p>The whistleblowers featured in the book, including former CIA officer <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3csy4vv\">John Kiriakou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/news-by-year/2009/04/human-rights-inquiry-hears-from-former-ambassador-on-torture/\">Craig Murray</a>, the former U.K. ambassador to Uzbekistan, learned the hard way that legal protections can end precisely where power begins. Both revealed grave human rights abuses – torture, kidnapping, imprisonment and complicity in war crimes – and both were prosecuted rather than protected. </p>\n\n<p>Their stories underline a paradox: Even as <a href=\"https://whistleblower.org/international-whistleblower-rights/\">new whistleblower protection laws have proliferated</a> in many countries, prosecutions of national security and intelligence whistleblowers are on the rise. In national security contexts, where no public interest defense is permitted, laws meant to protect whistleblowers have become another weapon of “lawfare” – used to silence, bankrupt and criminalize. </p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://whistleblower.org/bio-john-kiriakou/\">Kiriakou blew the whistle</a> on the U.S. torture program in 2007. The Bush administration initially declined to prosecute him, but this changed under the Obama administration, which imprisoned Kiriakou in 2013 for 30 months. Kiriakou’s refusal to participate in the CIA program of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-11723189\">enhanced interrogation</a>” of terrorism suspects, which included waterboarding, and his later decision to publicly confirm the CIA’s use of torture were acts of conscience. Yet it was he, not the torturers, who went to prison as a result of his disclosures.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is familiar. From <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/17/1129416671/chelsea-manning-wikileaks-memoir-readme\">Chelsea Manning</a> in 2010 to <a href=\"https://www.whistleblowers.org/news/the-case-of-edward-snowden/\">Edward Snowden</a> in 2013 and <a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/cases/united-states-v-hale\">Daniel Hale</a> in 2016, prosecutions under the U.S. Espionage Act and equivalent statutes elsewhere signal a broader shift: Making the powerful transparent is redefined as treason. The prosecution of national security whistleblowers who reveal crimes of the state continues to be an ongoing problem, as highlighted by more recent cases, including <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/reality-winner-memoir-excerpt/\">Reality Winner</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/australia-whistleblower-david-mcbride-afghanistan-war-crimes-1e7b44e76e645690c91874753bc87fe2\">David McBride</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the law is used to enforce secrecy and punish dissent, the moral terrain shifts. Civil disobedience becomes not only justified but necessary. Human rights lawyers have commented that whistleblowers and journalists who work with them are being subjected to <a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/what-we-owe-whistleblowers\">increasingly harsh treatment by the state</a>, including imprisonment and on occasion torture.</p>\n\n<h2>From traditional media to networked whistleblowing</h2>\n\n<p>Historically, whistleblowers relied on the press to act as an intermediary between them and the public, as well as a protector because of the publicity they offer. But as investigative journalism has been hollowed out – starved of resources and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nsa-surveillance-is-a-clear-threat-to-journalism-in-america-30063\">constrained by political and corporate pressure</a> – <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/priti-patels-new-threat-to-british-journalists/\">this model has faltered</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As journalist Andrew Fowler, one of our book’s contributors, wrote, “It may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources.” Across the globe, attacks by governments on journalists criticizing strongman leaders <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nobel-peace-prize-for-journalists-serves-as-reminder-that-freedom-of-the-press-is-under-threat-from-strongmen-and-social-media-169579\">become more brazen</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, Manning <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/17/1129416671/chelsea-manning-wikileaks-memoir-readme\">blew the whistle on U.S war crimes</a> in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many major outlets turned Manning away before WikiLeaks provided the infrastructure to publish <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/438956/readmetxt-by-manning-chelsea/9781529110623\">what mainstream media would not</a>. Her disclosures <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/35-years-for-manning-and-time-for-better-whistleblowing-laws-17333\">raised the public’s awareness</a> of government complicity in war crimes in Iraq and elsewhere. Such stories also reveal how reluctant mainstream journalism can be when confronted with power.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/article/2024/may/14/the-jailing-of-david-mcbride-is-a-dark-day-for-democracy-and-press-freedom-in-australia\">McBride blew the whistle</a> on members of the Australian SAS who murdered civilians in Afghanistan. He was sentenced to prison in 2024 and is currently serving a sentence of five years and eight months for his disclosures of war crimes.</p>\n\n<p>This decline in formal protections has given rise to an ecology of “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/S0733-558X20230000085007\">networked whistleblowing</a>”: decentralized alliances of whistleblowers, activists and independent journalists using encrypted tools to share information and protect sources. While these networks can offer safety in numbers, they also carry risks – of being co-opted or exploited by those in power, and of being framed collectively as enemies of the state for their attempts to hold the powerful to account.</p>\n\n<p>Yet they also represent a profound reimagining of public accountability in a digital age where secrecy is structural and systemic, demonstrating the force of people working together. </p>\n\n<p>As the traditional institutions of democracy falter, our research shows these alternative infrastructures embody a new form of democratic practice: horizontal, distributed and defiant. </p>\n\n<h2>New alliances supporting whistleblowers</h2>\n\n<p>The whistleblowers whose stories appear in our book did more than expose wrongdoing. They built communities of care and resistance – new institutions to protect truth-telling itself.</p>\n\n<p>Each of them, after suffering retaliation and exclusion, turned outward: campaigning for reform, mentoring others and building cross-sector alliances. Their transformation from individual insiders to collective activists reveals a crucial insight: Legal reform alone isn’t enough. What sustains truth-telling isn’t the promise of protection from above but solidarity from below. </p>\n\n<p>Strengthening and supporting these alliances would help preserve freedom of expression and the right to know. That means supporting cross-border networks of journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders who can collectively safeguard disclosure <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/ie/universitypress/subjects/management/business-ethics/regulators-last-resort-whistleblowers-limits-law-and-power-partnerships?format=PB\">when national laws fail</a>. It also means recognizing whistleblowing as a public good. </p>\n\n<p>At a time when many democracies are retreating from openness, these whistleblowers remind us that law and justice are not the same thing. When laws entrench secrecy or punish dissent, we believe breaking them can be an act of civic virtue. Civil disobedience can renew democratic life by holding power to account.</p>\n\n<p>Kiriakou’s conclusion in his chapter resonates beyond the intelligence world: “We all have to fight. It’s the only way we are going to change anything.” His words recall a longer lineage of civil disobedience – from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/article/20240307-in-history-suffragettes-speak-about-direct-action-and-their-brutal-treatment\">suffragettes</a> to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/3/19/photos-millions-protested-against-invasion-of-iraq\">anti-war protesters</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/climate-change-protest-london-extinction-rebellion\">environmental activists</a> – each confronting systems that refused to hear them until they broke the rules.</p>\n\n<p>The cases in our new book illustrate how quickly law can be used to enforce secrecy rather than accountability during periods of democratic backsliding. They also highlight the practical conditions that make truth-telling possible – including collective support that extends beyond any one country’s legal system.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269488/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Are they the same or different? – Namrata, age 13, Ghaziabad, India</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Imagine an epic video game with your favorite hero as a character. Another character is a mirror-image twin who shows up occasionally, exploding everything they touch. And, to add an extra level of difficulty, the game includes a mysterious hive of minions hiding at every corner, changing the rules of the game, but never showing themselves.</p>\n\n<p>If you think of these characters as types of matter, this video game is basically how our universe works.</p>\n\n<p>The hero is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/most-normal-matter-in-the-universe-isnt-found-in-planets-stars-or-galaxies-an-astronomer-explains-where-its-distributed-269313\">regular matter</a>, which is everything we can see around us. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsantimatter\">Antimatter is</a> the mirror-image explosive twin that scientists understand well but can barely find. And <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-the-mystery-substance-physics-still-cant-identify-that-makes-up-the-majority-of-our-universe-85808\">dark matter is</a> the invisible minions. It is everywhere, but we cannot see it, and scientists have no idea what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Despite having similar-sounding names, dark matter and antimatter are completely different. Interestingly, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Thmz9mIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">physicists like me</a> know exactly <a href=\"https://cms.cern/physics/what-and-where-antimatter\">what antimatter is</a>, but there is almost none of it around. On the other hand, we have no idea what dark matter is, but there is a lot of it everywhere.</p>\n\n<h2>Antimatter: The mirror-image twin</h2>\n\n<p>All the regular matter around you is made of basic building blocks called atoms. Atoms have <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">positively charged particles called protons</a> surrounded by tiny <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainselectrons\">negatively charged electrons</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Think of antimatter as regular matter’s oppositely charged twin. </p>\n\n<p>All particles, like protons and the electrons, have antimatter siblings. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/positron\">Electrons have positrons</a>, which are anti-electrons, while <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/antiproton\">protons have antiprotons</a>. Antiprotons and positrons make up <a href=\"https://home.cern/news/press-release/cern/first-atoms-antimatter-produced-cern\">antimatter atoms, or anti-atoms</a>. They’re like mirror images, but with their electric charges flipped. When matter and antimatter meet, they destroy each other in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5aJEq0k7s\">flash of light and energy and vanish</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, antimatter is very rare in our universe. But some special regular matter atoms, such as potassium, can decay to produce antimatter. For example, when you eat a banana, or any food rich in potassium, you are eating tiny amounts of these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvjwibAxz7c&amp;t=18s\">antimatter-producing atoms</a>. The amount is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/radtown/natural-radioactivity-food\">too small</a> to affect your health.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-wUb2JBIi8\">Antimatter was discovered</a> almost 100 years ago. Today, scientists can create, store and study antimatter in the laboratory. They understand its properties very well. Doctors even use it for <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10123-pet-scan\">PET scans</a>. They inject tiny amounts of antimatter-producing atoms into your body, and as these atoms travel through your body, the scan takes pictures of the flashes of light from the annihilation of the antimatter and regular matter in your body. This process lets doctors see what is happening inside your body.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists have also figured out that when the universe was born, there were almost <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/measuring-helium-in-distant-galaxies-may-give-physicists-insight-into-why-the-universe-exists-205891\">equal amounts of matter and antimatter</a>. They met and annihilated each other. Fortunately, just a tiny bit more regular matter survived to make stars, planets and all of us.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oS4MaZKdfE0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">If matter and antimatter annihilate each other when they touch, and there were once equal amounts of each, how is it possible that there is now so much more matter than antimatter in the universe?</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Dark matter: The invisible minions</h2>\n\n<p>Dark matter is far more mysterious. Have you ever spun very fast on a merry-go-round? If so, you know how hard it is to stay on it without getting thrown off, especially if you’re the only one on the merry-go-round.  </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine there are a bunch of invisible minions on that merry-go-round with you. You can’t see them and you can’t touch them, but they hold you and keep you from flying off as it spins super-fast. You know they’re there because the merry-go-round is heavier than it looks, and it is harder to push and get it spinning. The invisible minions don’t play or talk to anybody; they just hang around, adding their weight to everything. </p>\n\n<p>About 50 years ago, astronomer <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/vera-rubin\">Vera Rubin</a> discovered a similar mystery in <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/spiral-galaxy/\">spiral galaxies</a>. She looked at spinning galaxies, which are like cosmic merry-go-rounds, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-vera-c-rubin-observatory-will-help-astronomers-investigate-dark-matter-continuing-the-legacy-of-its-pioneering-namesake-259233\">noticed something strange</a>: The outer stars in these galaxies were spinning much faster than they should. They should have gone flying off into space like sparks from a firework display. But they did not.</p>\n\n<p>It was like watching kids on a merry-go-round move at incredible speed but somehow stay perfectly in place.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman adjusting a large piece of equipment.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/675244/original/file-20250618-56-vwa3gg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The astronomer Vera Rubin discovered a strong mismatch in spiral galaxies that scientists now understand as dark matter.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noirlab2003a/\">Carnegie Institution for Science</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The only explanation? There must be a sea of invisible “stuff” holding everything together <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsgravity\">with their extra gravity</a>. Scientists called this mystery material “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-the-mystery-substance-physics-still-cant-identify-that-makes-up-the-majority-of-our-universe-85808\">dark matter</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Since then, astronomers have observed similar strange behavior happening throughout the universe. Galaxies within <a href=\"https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/22aug06.html\">large clusters move</a> in unexpected ways. Light gets <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/shining-a-light-on-dark-matter/\">bent around galaxies more</a> than it should be. Galaxies <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/heic0701a/\">stick together far more</a> than the visible matter alone can explain. </p>\n\n<p>It is as if our cosmic playground has swings moving by themselves, and seesaws tipping with nobody visible sitting on them. </p>\n\n<p>Dark matter is just a placeholder name until scientists figure out what it is. For the past 50 years, many scientists have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUWUXKe-avM\">running experiments</a> that are trying <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/researchers-dig-deep-underground-in-hopes-of-finally-observing-dark-matter-211075\">to detect dark matter</a> or produce it in the lab. But so far, they have come up <a href=\"https://physicsworld.com/a/worlds-most-sensitive-dark-matter-search-comes-up-empty-handed/\">empty-handed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t know what dark matter is, but it’s everywhere. It could be <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/weakly-interacting-massive-particle\">unusual particles</a> scientists have not discovered yet. It could be something completely unexpected. But astronomers can tell by observing how fast galaxies rotate that there is about <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/how-much-dark-matter-universe\">five times more dark matter</a> than all the regular matter in the entire universe. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

Benin represents the fifth failed coup over the same period.</p>\n\n<p>The prevalence of military takeovers led United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres to warn as far back as 2021 of a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/an-epidemic-coups-un-chief-laments-urging-security-council-act-2021-10-26/\">coup “epidemic</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But can coups, like the pathogens of many epidemics, be contagious? Certainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/contagious-coups-what-is-fuelling-military-takeovers-across-west-africa\">observers around</a> <a href=\"https://trendsresearch.org/insight/coups-in-africa-history-driving-forces-and-contagion/?srsltid=AfmBOorBWe081KjRQPf6vauAAhojLlSmxEsCZEDG-Sf4jTzfq-n8fui5\">the world</a> continue to ask whether a military takeover in one country can influence the likelihood of another one happening elsewhere. </p>\n\n<h2>Do coups spread?</h2>\n\n<p>Cross-national research offers little firm evidence that a coup in one country directly increases the chances of another. And some scholars remain skeptical that such a phenomenon exists. Political scientist Naunihal Singh, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-myth-of-the-coup-contagion/\">argues that the recent wave’s coup plotters</a> are drawing less from contemporary events than from their own countries’ long histories of military intervention. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, he suggests that any observed regional cluster mostly reflects shared underlying conditions. For example, the countries across the Sahel region that have been the center of post-2020 African coups share a <a href=\"https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/the-coups-detat-of-the-sahel-region-domestic-causes-and-international-competition/\">common set of coup-prone pressures</a>: chronic insecurity driven by insurgencies, weak state capacity and widespread frustration over quality of governance.  </p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Michael Miller and colleagues at George Washington University, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002716649232\">in a broader analysis</a>, contend that would-be plotters pay closer attention to domestic dynamics than to foreign coups when deciding whether to move against their own governments.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://salahbenhammou.com/\">scholars of</a> <a href=\"https://jonathanmpowell.com/\">military coups</a>, we recently explored the phenomenon and have come to a different conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://salahbenhammou.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ben-hammou-powell-isr_coup-contagion_accepted-1.pdf\">forthcoming study</a> argues that would-be plotters do indeed pay close attention when contemporaries seize power. A number of dynamics, however, could keep a statistical trend from being realized.</p>\n\n<p>For one, statistical modeling typically requires contagion to occur within a tight temporal window, often 1 to 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings challenge this approach. A wave of so-called “Free Officers” coups – military takeovers led by junior or mid-ranking nationalist officers, inspired by Egypt’s 1952 <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170723-remembering-the-1952-egyptian-revolution/\">Free Officers movement</a> – is a widely invoked example of contagion. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1952/07/24/archives/coup-detat-in-egypt.html\">original Free Officers ousted King Farouk</a> and went on to abolish the monarchy and end British influence in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>However, it took a full six years before a second “Free Officers” coup occurred in the region, in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/14/newsid_3736000/3736391.stm\">Iraq in 1958</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A group of men in army uniforms sit and chat.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=490&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=490&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708517/original/file-20251212-56-7uzd0y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=490&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Egypt’s Gamal Abdul Nasser, center left, became an inspiration for other would-be coup leaders.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-egyptian-leader-muhammad-naguib-with-gamal-abdul-nasser-news-photo/3420280?adppopup=true\">Ronald Startup/Picture Post/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Rather than blindly follow the lead of Egypt’s coupists, would-be copycats watched closely, took notes and moved only when two factors lined up: the rewards appeared to be worth the risk, and they obtained the ability to make a takeover possible.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the post-1952 Middle East, the potential “rewards” of emulating Egypt’s Free Officers were not immediately apparent, even in countries with circumstances very similar to Egypt’s.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until the original Free Officers Movement’s leader, Colonel <a href=\"https://www.presidency.eg/en/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A4%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%86/%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B1/%22%22\">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, emerged as a revolutionary icon in the region that others attempted to emulate his success. Nasser’s status grew further through his anti-colonial sentiments and victories, like his handling of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5204490.stm\">Suez Crisis of 1956</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As Nasser’s influence grew, the perceived value of a military takeover increased, and Free Officers-inspired plots quickly proliferated against the region’s monarchies. Six years after the Egyptian coup, the first copycat coup succeeded in Iraq, followed by additional successes in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1962/10/09/archives/yemen-capital-quiet-11-days-after-revolt-yemens-capital-quiet-after.html\">Yemen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/09/02/archives/a-junta-in-libya-ousts-monarchy-sets-up-republic-military-council.html\">Libya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/05/27/archives/leftists-in-sudan-consolidate-power.html\">Sudan</a> between 1962 and 1969.</p>\n\n<p>A further complication to establishing a firm trend is that the success of one takeover may actually hinder the immediate progress of another. After all, would-be copycats are not the only observers. </p>\n\n<p>Vulnerable leaders and their allies can take cues from coups in other countries to try to mitigate their spread at home. </p>\n\n<p>Thwarted conspiracies in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/King-Hussein-Challenge-Arab-Radicalism/dp/0195054989\">Jordan</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00263206.2012.743892\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which were uncovered between 1955 and 1969, demonstrated that while the sentiment to emulate Egypt’s coup was widespread, not all plotters had the capacity to act. Some governments were better prepared to block these attempts. Foreign partners like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Containing_Arab_Nationalism/45_tAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=Containing+Arab+Nationalism:+The+Eisenhower+Doctrine+and+the+Middle+East&amp;dq=Containing+Arab+Nationalism:+The+Eisenhower+Doctrine+and+the+Middle+East&amp;printsec=frontcover\">the United States</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00263209508701040\">Great Britain</a> also played no small role in helping shore up their monarchical allies against coup plots. </p>\n\n<h2>Africa’s coup wave</h2>\n\n<p>The case of the Free Officers Movement shows that plotters wait for clear signals that a coup is worth the risk. In Africa today, those signals are more immediate, even without a monumental figure like Egypt’s Nasser. </p>\n\n<p>Coupists now see visible domestic support for military takeovers and muted international consequences for those who seize power.</p>\n\n<p>It is increasingly clear to us that the region has seen a large increase in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/civilian-support-for-military-coups-isnt-a-bug-its-a-feature-240877\">public support for military rule</a> during this post-2020 wave.</p>\n\n<p>Military coupists like Burkina Faso’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1egely9v3go\">Ibrahim Traoré</a> and Mali’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/winning-hearts-and-power-how-malis-military-regime-gained-popular-support-254518\">Assimi Goïta</a> have not only attracted domestic support but also regional popularity, lauded for their <a href=\"https://hir.harvard.edu/junta-rule-sahel/#:%7E:text=The%20Alliance%20of%20Sahel%20States%20(AES)%20is,government%20of%20military%20leader%20President%20Paul%2DHenri%20Damiba.\">anti-colonial rhetoric</a> against France and their <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/354735/confederation-of-sahel-states-tiani-traore-and-goita-try-to-outdo-ecowas/\">willingness to confront</a> the Economic Community of West Africa States.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/\">Data from Afrobarometer</a>, which has regularly asked about respondents’ positions on having military rule, illustrate this shift clearly.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"mq7Wu\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mq7Wu/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>In the survey wave that ended in 2013, less than 11% of respondents in Benin said they supported or strongly supported army rule. This nearly doubled to 19% by 2021 and has now tripled, with 1 in 3 people in Benin expressing support for military rule. While a majority still opposes military rule, the direction of this change is significant.</p>\n\n<p>These attitudes are reinforced by military leaders’ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/world/africa/mali-military-coup.html\">promises</a> to “clean up” corrupt or ineffective governments. <a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/articles/in-madagascar-citizens-want-democracy-but-willing-to-accept-military-intervention-if-elected-leaders-abuse-power-survey-shows/\">In Madagascar</a>, for example, over 60% of citizens in 2024 said it was permissible for the armed forces to remove leaders who abuse power.</p>\n\n<p>Highly visible images of cheering <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/civilian-support-for-military-coups-is-rising-in-parts-of-africa-why-the-reasons-matter-185448\">pro-military crowds</a> in countries like Niger and Gabon further signal that a takeover can gain public support.</p>\n\n<h2>International indifference</h2>\n\n<p>The international signals are just as important. From the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/12/5/how-the-african-union-got-it-wrong-on-zimbabwe\">near-absent reaction</a> to the Zimbabwean military’s removal of Robert Mugabe in 2017 to the <a href=\"https://issafrica.org/iss-today/au-balancing-act-on-chads-coup-sets-a-disturbing-precedent\">lukewarm response</a> to Chad’s military takeover in 2021, these cases suggest that international punishment can be temporary or even nonexistent. </p>\n\n<p>The message is reinforced when coup leaders who are initially condemned, like Madagascar’s Randrianirina, later <a href=\"https://www.sadc.int/latest-news/communique-extraordinary-summit-sadc-heads-state-and-government-07th-november-2025\">gain acceptance</a> from regional organizations like the South African Development Community. In Guinea-Bissau, attention on last month’s coup has somehow seemed to focus more on President Embaló’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m8nm22785o\">alleged involvement in the coup</a> than on the military’s unconstitutional seizure of power.</p>\n\n<p>And the lessons drawn from international responses involve more than just the seizure of power. Contemporary military leaders are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/gabons-coup-leaders-have-changed-the-constitution-to-entrench-their-power-its-a-growing-trend-in-west-africa-244182\">staying in power much longer</a> than their predecessors in the early 2000s, either by indefinitely delaying elections or by directly contesting them.</p>\n\n<p>Although the African Union’s framework <a href=\"https://amaniafrica-et.org/can-aus-anti-coup-norm-survive-a-scenario-in-which-the-military-leaders-of-all-suspended-countries-run-for-elections-following-the-precedent-in-chad-and-gabon/\">specifically forbids</a> coup leaders from standing in elections, there has been virtually no consequences for coupists consolidating their rule via elections in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz96ezdljl9o\">places like Chad</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31kxg35dro\">and Gabon</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This is not lost on would-be plotters, who see their contemporaries seize and <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/09/coups-contagious-gabon-chad-west-central-africa/\">legitimize their authority</a> with minimal pushback.</p>\n\n<p>To some degree, the spread of coups depends on how they are received. And in the case of the recent rash of military takeovers in Africa, the international community and domestic policymakers have done little in the way of stemming that spread.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271661/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

There was a red carpet reception at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and <a href=\"https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/05/content_WS69323040c6d00ca5f9a07eed.html\">high-level talks</a> with President Xi Jinping on trade, technology and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>But the defining image of this diplomatic trip did not take place in the capital. Rather, it occurred more than <a href=\"http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2025-12/08/c_1146331.htm#:%7E:text=Xi%2C%20Macron%20have%20friendly%20exchanges,Home%20%3E%20News\">1,000 miles (1,600 km) away in Chengdu</a>, Sichuan province. There, Xi hosted Macron for a rare instance of “<a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202405/08/WS663b3060a31082fc043c5ef8.html\">no-tie diplomacy</a>,” a term used by Chinese media to describe a relaxed and informal style of statecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping outside the rigid protocols of Beijing, Xi personally guided Macron through the mist-covered mountains of Sichuan. The walk held high significance: It marked the <a href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1383768-key-takeaways-from-ximacron-meeting-at-china\">first time</a> Xi has hosted a foreign leader for such an informal sightseeing meeting outside the capital, with an itinerary that included the Dujiangyan irrigation system, a visit to China’s national table tennis team and the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.</p>\n\n<p>Global attention remains understandably fixed on “hard” issues — <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/frances-macron-threatens-china-with-tariffs-over-trade-surplus-les-echos-2025-12-07/\">trade tariffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/world/asia/china-france-macron-ukraine.html\">the war in Ukraine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202512/10/WS6938d612a310d6866eb2dd8e.html\">nuclear energy</a>. But as a <a href=\"https://macmillan.yale.edu/foxfellowship/person/xianda-huang\">cultural historian of modern China</a>, I believe the choreography of this visit offers a vital window into Beijing’s diplomatic strategy. By foregrounding things like ancient waterways and table tennis, China is deploying a sophisticated brand of cultural statecraft designed to soften the edges of a hardening geopolitical landscape.</p>\n\n<h2>The reciprocity of ‘home diplomacy’</h2>\n\n<p>The choice to host Macron in Chengdu was not random, but a carefully curated act of diplomatic reciprocity. In April 2024, Macron had invited Xi to his personal retreat in the <a href=\"https://www.mfa.gov.cn/zyxw/202405/t20240508_11300842.shtml\">French Pyrenees</a>, a gesture intended to foster personal intimacy.</p>\n\n<p>During the latest tour, Xi reportedly <a href=\"https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/china/story20251205-7921948\">referenced their previous meeting</a>, telling Macron: “Last year you invited me to your hometown in the Hautes-Pyrénées; I believe this visit will further deepen your understanding of China.”</p>\n\n<p>By bringing Macron to Sichuan, Xi was returning the favor, moving the relationship from the professional to the personal. This reflects a shift in Chinese diplomacy from a “<a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/\">Wolf Warrior</a>” mentality, defined by confrontation and rhetorical aggression, toward a more relational approach with key European partners. By investing time in this kind of provincial visit, Beijing is signaling that it views France not just as a trading partner, but as a nation worthy of deep, personal engagement.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men in overcoats walk on a bridge in front of a pagoda.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708545/original/file-20251212-56-c7432e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">French President Emmanuel Macron’s sightseeing tour recalls that of U.S. President Richard Nixon during his breakthrough 1972 visit to China.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-richard-nixon-along-with-premier-zhou-enlai-news-photo/514871470?adppopup=true\">Bettmann/Contributor/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This outreach is especially important at a time when <a href=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-14-us-china-trade-war-reignites-global-markets-brace-for-impact-as-tensions-escalate\">China–U.S. trade tensions</a> remain high, as Beijing increasingly looks to the European Union as a critical component of its broader strategy to counter Washington-led containment efforts.</p>\n\n<h2>Governing with the flow</h2>\n\n<p>The centerpiece of Macron’s cultural tour in China was the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1001/\">Dujiangyan irrigation system</a>.

It embodies the Taoist principle of wu wei (nonaction) and Xi’s metaphor “<a href=\"https://www.qstheory.cn/20241223/8a21b4cc26a14d288fd57cf69ddd7b73/c.html\">to govern water is to govern the country</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>By showcasing this specific site, Xi was offering a <a href=\"http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/20251206/6320fd82a04544229d967adac0a37682/c.html\">subtle lesson</a> in statecraft. The metaphor implies a governance style based on balance, adaptability and working with natural forces rather than confronting them head-on. </p>\n\n<p>In the context of strained international relations, the message to France was clear: Cooperation should not be constrained by rigid binaries between East and West, nor shaped by the logic of containment. Instead, it should follow the natural flow of mutual interests — ranging from trade and climate action to cultural and educational exchange.</p>\n\n<h2>Pingpong diplomacy 2.0</h2>\n\n<p>If Dujiangyan represented ancient wisdom, the visit to the Sichuan Provincial Gymnasium brought diplomacy into the modern, high-energy arena of sport.</p>\n\n<p>Table tennis holds a mythical place in Chinese diplomatic history. The original “<a href=\"https://diplomacy.state.gov/ping-pong-diplomacy-historic-1971-u-s-table-tennis-trip-to-china/\">ping-pong diplomacy</a>” of the early 1970s helped thaw the ice between China and the United States, paving the way for President Richard Nixon’s  historic 1972 visit. As historian Pete Millwood argues in “<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/improbable-diplomats/A63E10725F81C8FA9D84DDC670DDC671\">Improbable Diplomats</a>,” these athletic exchanges offered a politically safe and publicly palatable setting through which both countries could begin signaling a major shift in diplomatic relations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a suit stands at a table tennis table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708539/original/file-20251212-56-j3trhr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">French President Emmanuel Macron takes on Chinese table tennis players at Sichuan University in Chengdu on Dec. 5, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-president-emmanuel-macron-plays-table-tennis-with-news-photo/2249420558?adppopup=true\">Sarah Meyssonnier/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>On Dec. 5, Macron tapped into this legacy when he visited the venue of the <a href=\"https://www.ittf.com/2025/12/05/ittf-honoured-to-welcome-french-president-emmanuel-macron-at-ittf-mixed-team-world-cup-chengdu-2025/\">2025 ITTF Mixed Team World Cup</a> and participated in an impromptu match. Partnering with French players Félix Lebrun and Prithika Pavade against Chinese stars Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha, Macron engaged in a lighthearted rally that went viral on Chinese social media.</p>\n\n<p>In an era where diplomatic interactions are often scripted and stern, these moments humanize the “other side” for the domestic public, creating a reservoir of public goodwill that leaders can draw upon when navigating difficult political compromises.</p>\n\n<h2>Soft power with fur</h2>\n\n<p>While the two leaders bonded over paddles, Brigitte Macron, France’s first lady, engaged with China’s most enduring soft-power asset: the giant panda. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240226-a-brief-history-of-panda-diplomacy---with-new-additions-to-global-zoos\">Panda diplomacy</a>” has been a hallmark of Beijing’s foreign policy since the 1950s. The loaning of these animals is a barometer of political warmth; their recall can signal a chill. </p>\n\n<p>The French First Lady visited the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding to see “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/giant-pandas-china-france-brigitte-emmanuel-macron-6d45972765572a083459ae0841d4953d\">Yuan Meng</a>.” As the first panda born in France, to parents on loan from China, Yuan Meng is a living symbol of the bilateral relationship between France and China. Brigitte Macron, who is his godmother, helped facilitate Yuan Meng’s return to China alongside his parents in November 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Following Brigitte Macron’s visit, the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/france-to-receive-new-pandas-from-china-after-macron-xi-meeting\">a new agreement</a> to send two more pandas to France by 2027 served as a tangible deliverable of the summit.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A black-and-white panda hangs on a tree.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708547/original/file-20251212-56-wsiue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A giant panda looks on as French first lady Brigitte Macron makes a visit to the Chengdu research base for giant panda breeding.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/giant-panda-plays-in-a-tree-during-a-visit-by-french-first-news-photo/2249405723?adppopup=true\">Ludovic Marin /AFP via Getty Images)</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The limits of cultural diplomacy</h2>\n\n<p>What do waterworks, pingpong and pandas add up to?</p>\n\n<p>Critics might dismiss these events as mere pageantry — a velvet glove concealing the brutal fist of realpolitik. Indeed, a friendly game of table tennis does not resolve the European Union’s concerns over Chinese state subsidies, nor does it bridge the gap regarding China’s <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-position-russias-invasion-ukraine\">stance on the war in Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, dismissing the cultural dimension ignores how China views diplomacy. For Beijing, “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/01/xi-jinping-donald-trump-meeting-diplomacy-1005042\">friendly atmosphere</a>” is often a prerequisite for progress on substantive political issues.</p>\n\n<p>The Xi-Macron meeting in Chengdu also signaled a refinement of Chinese soft power, moving away from the combative rhetoric of recent years toward a strategy that embraces warmer ties with key European powers like France.</p>\n\n<p>While culture cannot replace hard diplomacy, this Macron visit demonstrates that in 2025, the road to political consensus in Beijing may very well run through the panda enclosure and table tennis arena.</p>\n\n<p>This long-term intent was encapsulated in the <a href=\"https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/china/story20251205-7921948\">leaders’ farewell at Dujiangyan</a>. As they parted ways, Xi joked, “Next time, we’ll see another place.” Macron’s immediate response — “Of course, definitely” — hints that this cultural diplomacy is designed to be an ongoing effort.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271597/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Xianda Huang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In this view, scientists simply discover truth, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/09/24/224785758/is-science-value-free\">truth speaks for itself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But history tells a different story. Scientific theories do not simply reveal themselves; they compete for attention, credibility and uptake. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once suggested that “<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/abrams-v-united-states\">the best test of truth</a> is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,” a line that helped popularize the metaphor of a “<a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/marketplace-of-ideas/\">marketplace of ideas</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>In this view, science is not outside the market, but inside a public arena where claims vie for audiences, resources and belief – and where power, persuasion and social position shape which ideas are heard, trusted or forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.up.edu/directory/Beth-DuFault.html\">marketing scholar trained in economic sociology</a>, I study how institutions that are supposedly above or apart from market logics – such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2025.2562466\">science</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/677894\">religion</a>, <a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/122127773/acr_vol46_2411720-libre.pdf\">medicine</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/nvsm.1544\">education</a> – use marketing tools to sustain credibility and build or keep moral authority. </p>\n\n<p>When I tell people that one of the areas I study is the marketing of science, they are often surprised at the concept. Yet persuasion is an integral part of the scientific process.</p>\n\n<p>From Isaac Newton’s followers and their coffeehouse demonstrations of physics wonders to today’s <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/\">TED Talks</a> and TikTok explainers, scientists have long relied on storytelling and demonstration to make invisible truths visible. For scientific theories to supplant other plausible theories, to challenge existing theories and win acceptance, they must be correct – but they must also be convincing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"people in 1700s clothes gather around a column with a glass globe on top with one man talking and gesturing\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=569&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=569&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708518/original/file-20251212-56-ox8kym.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=569&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People didn’t need to read Isaac Newton’s indecipherable Latin or understand his incomprehensible mathematics; they could just watch the live demonstrations, as in this depiction of an 18th-century nighttime scientific lecture on pneumatics.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/philosopher-shewing-an-experiment-on-the-air-pump-1769-an-news-photo/102726510?adppopup=true\">Joseph Wright of Derby/Science &amp; Society Picture Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The original science influencers</h2>\n\n<p>In the early 1700s, Isaac Newton’s followers turned abstract theory into public performance and cultural fashion.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.denison.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&amp;context=episteme\">Cartesian philosophy</a> dominated intellectual life. Newton’s 1687 book “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5479/sil.52126.39088015628399\">Principia Mathematica</a>” proposed a new worldview of gravity, optics and motion, but the mathematics was so dense that few could grasp it. </p>\n\n<p>Although Newton himself was a recluse, a circle of zealous Newtonian men of science, <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501742255/the-newtonians-and-the-english-revolution-1689-1720/\">described by historians</a> as <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Selling-Science-in-the-Age-of-Newton-Advertising-and-the-Commoditization-of-Knowledge/Wigelsworth/p/book/9781409400752\">devoted disciples and even evangelists</a> for Newton’s natural philosophy, took his new theories on the road. These itinerant lecturers performed experiments and spectaculars in London coffeehouses and aristocratic salons, demonstrating Newtonian physics. They sold tickets, pamphlets and even branded scientific instruments so audiences could reproduce these marvels at home.</p>\n\n<p>Historian of science Jeff Wigelsworth showed that Newton’s evangelizers built <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Selling-Science-in-the-Age-of-Newton-Advertising-and-the-Commoditization-of-Knowledge/Wigelsworth/p/book/9781409400752\">what today might be called a brand</a>: experiences, artifacts and emotions that linked scientific authority to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history\">Enlightenment ideals of reason and progress</a>, and to their own personalities. </p>\n\n<p>My own research finds that these men of science also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2025.2562466\">used a suite of early marketing activities</a>.

Influencer-scientists use storytelling, humor and design to reach millions. If scientists don’t do this themselves, their proponents, just like Newton’s disciples, may do it for them. </p>\n\n<p>I call this process the marketization of moral authority: when historically sacred or ostensibly impartial institutions such as science, religion and education increasingly organize themselves as markets, adopting promotional, pricing and product logics to secure their legitimacy, authority, appeal and funding.</p>\n\n<p>None of this effort is inherently bad. As in Newton’s time, effective marketing communications can make complex work accessible and even inspiring.

After all, every field uses communication and outreach. </p>\n\n<p>It matters because science is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/confidence-in-scientists-medical-scientists-and-other-groups-and-institutions-in-society/\">one of the few institutions people still rely on</a> to anchor truth claims in evidence. And when the boundary between scientific fact and promotion blurs, it becomes easy to confuse confidence with credibility, or charisma with responsible consensus. </p>\n\n<p>Scientific rhetoric can easily be co-opted. Think of wellness influencers using “quantum” jargon to sell supplements; AI companies invoking neuroscience to legitimatize untested technologies; charlatans mimicking the language of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-peer-review-the-role-anonymous-experts-play-in-scrutinizing-research-before-it-gets-published-258255\">peer review</a> to sow doubt. </p>\n\n<p>But awareness is a form of protection. When you recognize that scientific authority can be built through persuasion, you become more discerning consumers of it. Faced with a message involving science, you can consider: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who is framing this message, and why?</li>\n<li>What evidence supports it? Is this evidence vetted and validated by rigorous studies?</li>\n<li>Is it appealing to emotion or identity, rather than objective logic?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This process can help you become more scientifically literate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/multiple-goals-multiple-solutions-plenty-of-second-guessing-and-revising-heres-how-science-really-works-231249\">Science has never been the pristine</a>, market-free ideal many imagine. It has always lived – sometimes uneasily – within a marketplace of ideas, competing for belief, attention and authority.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing that reality humanizes science and reminds us that truth must be discovered, communicated and, ultimately, accepted.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267707/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Beth DuFault has received funding from the Ahmanson Foundation. </span></em></p>",

Thirty-eight states <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/artificial-intelligence-2025-legislation\">enacted laws in 2025 regulating AI</a> in one way or another. They range from <a href=\"https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1779816\">prohibiting stalking</a> via AI-powered robots to <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/en/insights/texas-signs-responsible-ai-governance-act-into-law\">barring AI systems</a> that can manipulate people’s behavior. </p>\n\n<p>The executive order declares that it is the policy of the United States to produce a “minimally burdensome” national framework for AI. The order calls on the U.S. attorney general to create an AI litigation task force to challenge state AI laws that are inconsistent with the policy. It also orders the secretary of commerce to identify “onerous” state AI laws that conflict with the policy and to withhold funding under the <a href=\"https://www.ntia.gov/funding-programs/high-speed-internet-programs/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program\">Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program</a> to states with those laws. The executive order exempts state AI laws related to child safety.</p>\n\n<p>Executive orders are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-executive-orders-can-make-change-but-are-limited-and-can-be-undone-by-the-courts-247857\">directives to federal agencies</a> on how to implement existing laws. The AI executive order directs federal departments and agencies to take actions that the administration claims fall under their legal authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Big tech companies have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-silicon-valley-campaign-to-win-trump-over-on-ai-regulation-214bd6bd\">lobbied for the federal government</a> to override state AI regulations. The companies have argued that the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/how-big-tech-is-pitting-washington-against-california-00336484\">burden of following multiple state regulations</a> hinders innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of the state laws tend to frame them as attempts to <a href=\"https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/states-take-lead-laboratories-ai-regulation\">balance public safety with economic benefit</a>. Prominent examples are <a href=\"https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-ai-governance-legislation-tracker/\">laws in California, Colorado, Texas and Utah</a>. Here are some of the major state laws regulating AI that could be targeted under the executive order:</p>\n\n<h2>Algorithmic discrimination</h2>\n\n<p>Colorado’s <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205\">Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence</a> is the first comprehensive state law in the U.S. that aims to regulate AI systems used in employment, housing, credit, education and health care decisions. However, enforcement of the law <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorado-is-pumping-the-brakes-on-first-of-its-kind-ai-regulation-to-find-a-practical-path-forward-269065\">has been delayed</a> while the state legislature considers its ramifications. </p>\n\n<p>The focus of the Colorado AI act is <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/a-deep-dive-into-colorados-artificial-intelligence-act/\">predictive artificial intelligence systems</a>, which make decisions, not newer generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, which create content. </p>\n\n<p>The Colorado law aims to protect people from algorithmic discrimination. The law requires organizations using these “high-risk systems” to make impact assessments of the technology, notify consumers whether predictive AI will be used in consequential decisions about them, and make public the types of systems they use and how they plan to manage the risks of algorithmic discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>A similar Illinois law scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to make it <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/IL/drafts/HB3773/2023\">a civil rights violation</a> for employers to use AI tools that result in discrimination.</p>\n\n<h2>On the ‘frontier’</h2>\n\n<p>California’s <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53\">Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act</a> specifies guardrails on the development of the most powerful AI models. These models, called foundation or frontier models, are any AI model that is trained on extremely large and varied datasets and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.07258\">that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks</a> without additional training.

This poses <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.03718\">challenges to regulating the technology</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Their internal workings are invisible to users and sometimes even their creators, leading them to be called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-black-box-a-computer-scientist-explains-what-it-means-when-the-inner-workings-of-ais-are-hidden-203888\">black boxes</a>. The <a href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/December-2025/index.html\">Foundation Model Transparency Index</a> shows that these large models can be quite opaque. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://internationalaisafetyreport.org/\">risks from such large AI models</a> include malicious use, malfunctions and systemic risks. These models could potentially pose catastrophic risks to society. For example, someone could <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/controversial-california-ai-bill-amended-222458144.html\">use an AI model to create a weapon</a> that results in mass casualties, or instruct one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing billions of dollars in damages. </p>\n\n<p>The California law requires developers of frontier AI models to describe how they incorporate national and international standards and industry-consensus best practices. It also requires them to provide a summary of any assessment of catastrophic risk. The law also directs the state’s Office of Emergency Services to set up a mechanism for anyone to report a critical safety incident and to confidentially submit summaries of any assessments of the potential for catastrophic risk.</p>\n\n<h2>Disclosures and liability</h2>\n\n<p>Texas enacted the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act, which imposes restrictions on the development and deployment of AI systems <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/en/insights/texas-signs-responsible-ai-governance-act-into-law\">for purposes such as behavioral manipulation</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/safe_harbor\">safe harbor</a> provisions – protections against liability – in the Texas AI act are meant to provide incentives for businesses to document compliance with responsible AI governance frameworks such as the <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2025-july/texas-enters-ai-sandbox-with-traiga-implications-business-trials/\">NIST AI Risk Management Framework</a>. </p>\n\n<p>What is novel about the Texas law is that it stipulates the creation of a “<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Sandbox\">sandbox</a>” – an isolated environment where software can be safely tested – for developers to test the behavior of an AI system.</p>\n\n<p>The Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/%7E2024/bills/static/SB0149.html\">imposes disclosure requirements</a> on organizations using generative AI tools with their customers. Such laws ensure that a company using generative AI tools bears the ultimate responsibility for resulting consumer liabilities and harms and cannot shift the blame to the AI. This law is the first in the nation to stipulate consumer protections and require companies to prominently disclose when a consumer is interacting with generative AI system. </p>\n\n<h2>Other moves</h2>\n\n<p>States are also taking other legal and political steps to protect their citizens from the potential harms of AI.</p>\n\n<p>Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he opposes federal efforts to override state AI regulations. He has also <a href=\"https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-12-04/gov-ron-desantis-proposes-florida-ai-bill-of-rights\">proposed a Florida AI bill of rights</a> to address “obvious dangers” of the technology.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the attorneys general of 38 states and the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands <a href=\"https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/media/cms/12_68B5C629180F6.pdf\">called on AI companies</a>, including Anthropic, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity AI and xAI, to fix sycophantic and delusional outputs from generative AI systems. These are outputs that can lead users to become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">overly trusting</a> of the AI systems or <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/ai-psychosis-is-a-medical-mystery/685133/\">even delusional</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not clear what effect the executive order will have, and observers have said <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/nx-s1-5638562/trump-ai-david-sacks-executive-order\">it is illegal</a> because <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/why-trumps-ai-eo-will-be-doa-in-court/\">only Congress can supersede state laws</a>.

According to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A7&amp;version=KJV\">the Gospel of Luke</a>, Mary placed her child in a manger – an animal feeding bin – “because there was no room for them in the inn.”</p>\n\n<p>No mere babysitters, the ox and ass harken back to the Book of Isaiah 1:3, a verse early Christians interpreted as <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201%3A3&amp;version=KJV\">a prophecy of the birth of Christ</a>. In some early artwork, these beasts of burden kneel to show their reverence – recognizing this swaddled babe, who entered the world in humble circumstances, as lordly.</p>\n\n<p>The canonical Gospels, the accounts of Jesus’ life included in the Bible’s New Testament, make no mention of those animals welcoming the newborn. Yet the motif was already seen in <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:9821_-_Milano_-_Sant%27Ambrogio_-_Sarcofago_di_Stilicone_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto_25-Apr-2007.jpg\">art from the fourth century</a>. It was further popularized by <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/9781532637131/the-gospel-of-pseudo-matthew-and-the-nativity-of-mary/\">the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew</a>, <a href=\"https://www.harvard.com/book/9781648766275\">an apocryphal text</a> – that is, one not included in the canon of Scripture. Pseudo-Matthew was composed by an anonymous monk, probably in the seventh century, and includes many tales about Jesus growing up.</p>\n\n<p>After its account of Jesus’ birth, the Bible is almost entirely silent on his childhood. Yet legends about Jesus’ early years circulated widely in the Middle Ages – the focus of <a href=\"https://www.pennpress.org/9780812248845/the-quest-for-the-christ-child-in-the-later-middle-ages/#:%7E:text=In%20The%20Quest%20for%20the,intellectual%20elite%20of%20the%20church.\">my 2017 book</a>.

Searching for him with great anxiety, they find him conversing with religious teachers, both asking questions and astounding them with his answers. Fourteenth-century painter Simone Martini’s “Christ Discovered in the Temple” portrays him standing before his parents with crossed arms – a stubborn youth, apparently unapologetic about making them worry for days.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/9781532637131/the-gospel-of-pseudo-matthew-and-the-nativity-of-mary/\">apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew</a> – especially versions that incorporate material from <a href=\"https://www.tonyburke.ca/infancy-gospel-of-thomas/\">an even earlier apocryphal gospel, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas</a> – focuses on the years of Jesus’ childhood.

According to the biblical Gospel of Matthew, Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus to Egypt after <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202&amp;version=KJV\">an angel warns in a dream that Herod, King of Judea, would kill the child</a>. In Pseudo-Matthew’s elaboration of this episode, we see Jesus, not yet 2 years old, bravely stand on his feet before dragons emanating from a cave, where his family has stopped to rest.</p>\n\n<p>The terrifying dragons <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/9781532637131/the-gospel-of-pseudo-matthew-and-the-nativity-of-mary/\">worship him and then depart</a>, while Jesus boldly assures those around him that he is the “perfect man” and can “tame every kind of wild beast.” He later commands a palm tree to bend down so that a weary Mary can partake of its fruits, and he miraculously shortens their journey in the desert. </p>\n\n<p>At times, the Jesus of these legends is largely to blame for the troubles around him. The 14th-century <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1922-0412-1-CR\">Tring Tiles</a>, now in the British Museum, depict one of Jesus’ friends imprisoned by his father in a tower. Christ pulls him out of a tiny hole, like a gallant medieval knight rescuing a maiden in distress. The father had tried to insulate his son from Jesus’ influence – understandable, considering that many legends show Jesus causing the death of his playmates or other boys who somehow irked him. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/9781532637131/the-gospel-of-pseudo-matthew-and-the-nativity-of-mary/\">a story</a> summarized by one scholar as “<a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/e140dfbe65fe81c5e2f7b86d16bff5fb/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1816657\">death for a bump</a>,” a boy runs into Jesus.

When the other children see this, they “thought they would do the same …. But they were too eager, and they all fell down at once. One and another jumped up quickly onto the sunbeam, but it turned out badly for them, since each one broke his neck.” Jesus heals the boys at his parents’ prompting.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph admits to his neighbors that Jesus “was indeed too wild” and sends him away. The 7-year-old Jesus becomes apprenticed to a dyer, who gives him very precise directions about dyeing three pieces of cloth in three different vats. Once his master has left, Jesus ignores his instructions, throwing all the cloth into one vat – yet still achieves the desired outcome.

But regular reports of <a href=\"https://news.constructconnect.com/michigan-chosen-to-build-multi-billion-dollar-openai-stargate-data-center-facility\">proposals for new ones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-large-load-data-centers/806300/\">cancellations of planned ones</a> mean that it’s difficult to know exactly how many data centers will actually be built and how much electricity might be required to run them.</p>\n\n<p>As a researcher of energy policy who has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-doesnt-the-u-s-bury-its-power-lines-104829\">studied the cost challenges</a> associated with new utility infrastructure, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yxN_35oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">I</a> know that uncertainty comes with a cost. In the electricity sector, it is the challenge of <a href=\"https://www.naruc.org/\">state utility regulators</a> to decide who pays what shares of the costs associated with generating and serving these types of operations, sometimes broadly called “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-grid-investments-take-off-power-demand-hikes-2025-01-28/\">large load centers</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>States are exploring different approaches, each with strengths, weaknesses and potential drawbacks.</p>\n\n<h2>A new type of customer?</h2>\n\n<p>For years, large electricity customers such as <a href=\"https://www.etextilecommunications.com/news/textile-industry-energy-requirements-for-today-and-the-future/article_5954bfbe-d277-11ec-b16d-f3a35e584597.html\">textile mills</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.se.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2024/10/01/process-electrification-helps-cut-co2-in-refining/\">refineries</a> have used enough electricity to power a small city.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, their construction timelines were more aligned with the development time of new electricity infrastructure. If a company wanted to build a new <a href=\"https://shawinc.com/Newsroom/Press-Releases/Shaw-Invests-$250-Million-in-Andalusia,-Ala-Fiber\">textile mill</a> and the utility needed to build a new <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/powerplants/capitalcost/pdf/capital_cost_AEO2025.pdf\">gas-fired power plant</a> to serve it, the construction on both could start around the same time. Both could be ready in <a href=\"https://bush.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/V5-3-AI-Data-Centers_Final.pdf\">two and a half to three years</a>, and the textile mill could start paying for the costs necessary to serve it. </p>\n\n<p>Modern data centers use a similar amount of electricity but <a href=\"https://dgtlinfra.com/building-data-center-construction/\">can be built</a> in nine to 12 months. To meet that projected demand, construction of a new gas-fired power plant, or a solar farm with battery storage, must begin a year – maybe two – before the data center breaks ground.</p>\n\n<p>During the time spent building the electrical supply, computing technology advances, including both the capabilities and the efficiency of the kinds of calculations artificial intelligence systems require. Both factors affect how much <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/24/what-we-know-about-energy-use-at-us-data-centers-amid-the-ai-boom/\">electricity a data center will use</a> once it is built.</p>\n\n<p>Technological, logistical and planning changes mean there is a lot of uncertainty about how much electricity a data center will ultimately use. So it’s very hard for a utility company to know how much generating capacity to start building.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large industrial site with two tall smokestacks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707160/original/file-20251208-56-lnohki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Keeping older coal plants running may be an expensive way to generate power.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-mount-storm-coal-fired-power-station-owned-by-dominion-news-photo/2224533087\">Ulysse Bellier/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Handling the risks of development</h2>\n\n<p>This uncertainty costs money: A power plant could be built in advance, only to find out that <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-large-load-data-centers/806300/\">some or all of its capacity isn’t needed</a>. Or no power plant is built, and a data center pops up, <a href=\"https://ceea.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Virginias-Energy-Crossroads-CEEA-Oct-2025-Final.pdf\">competing for a limited supply of electricity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, someone needs to pay – for the excess capacity or for the increased price of what power is available. There are three possible groups that might pay: the utilities that provide electricity, the data center customers, and the rest of the customers on the system.</p>\n\n<p>However, utility companies have largely ensured their risk is minimal. Under most <a href=\"https://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/COSR_history_final.pdf\">state utility-regulation processes</a>, state officials review spending proposals from utility companies to determine what expenses can be passed on to customers. That includes operating expenses such as salaries and fuel costs, as well as capital investments, such as new power plants and other equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Regulators typically examine whether proposed expenses are useful for providing service to customers and reasonable for the utility to expect to incur. Utilities have been very careful to provide their regulators with evidence about the costs and effects of proposed data centers to justify passing the costs of proposed investments in new power plants along to whomever the customers happen to be.</p>\n\n<p>Regulators, then, are left to equitably allocate the costs to the prospective data center customers and the rest of the ratepayers, including homes and businesses. In different states, this is playing out differently.</p>\n\n<h2>Kentucky’s approach to usefulness</h2>\n\n<p>Kentucky is attempting to address the demand uncertainty by conditionally <a href=\"https://www.lpm.org/news/2025-10-28/kentucky-regulators-grant-lg-e-ku-permission-to-build-power-plants-for-future-data-centers\">approving two new natural gas-fired generators</a> in the state. However, the utility companies – Louisville Gas &amp; Electric and Kentucky Utilities – must demonstrate that those plants will actually be needed and used. But it’s not clear how they could do that, especially considering the time frames involved.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, suppose the utility has a letter of agreement or even a contract with a new data center or other large customer. That might be sufficient proof for the regulator to approve charging customers for the costs of building a new power plant.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s not clear what would happen if the data center ends up not being built, or needing much less power than expected. If the utility can’t get the money from the data center company – because they bill customers based on actual usage – that leaves regular consumers on the hook. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large rectangular building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707158/original/file-20251208-56-gsqtqt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A data center in Columbus, Ohio, is just one of many being built or proposed around the country.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-col4-ai-ready-data-center-is-located-on-a-seven-acre-news-photo/2226519693\">Eli Hiller/For The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Ohio’s ‘demand ratchet’ and credit guarantee</h2>\n\n<p>In Ohio, the major power company AEP has a <a href=\"https://www.aepohio.com/company/about/rates/data-center-tariff/\">specific rate plan for data centers</a> and other large electricity customers. One element, called a “demand ratchet,” is designed to mitigate month-to-month uncertainty in electricity consumption by data centers. The data center’s monthly bill is based on the current month’s demand or 85% of the highest monthly demand from the previous 11 months – whichever is higher. </p>\n\n<p>The benefit is that it protects against a data center using huge amounts of electricity one month and very little the next, which would otherwise yield a much lower bill. The ratchet helps ensure that the data center is paying a significant share of the cost of providing enough electricity, even if it doesn’t use as much as was expected.</p>\n\n<p>This ratchet effectively locks in the data center’s payments for 12 months, but regulators might expect a longer commitment from the center. For instance, Florida’s utilities regulator has <a href=\"https://www.floridapsc.com/pscfiles/library/filings/2025/15178-2025/15178-2025.pdf\">approved</a> an <a href=\"https://www.floridapsc.com/pscfiles/library/filings/2025/08075-2025/08075-2025.pdf\">agreement</a> that would require a data center company to pay for 70% of the agreed-upon demand in their entire electricity contract, even if the company didn’t use the power. </p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of Ohio’s approach addresses the risk of changing business plans or technology. AEP requires a credit guarantee, like a deposit, letter of credit or parent company guarantee of payment, equal to 50% of the customer’s expected minimum bill under the contract. While this theoretically reduces the risk borne by other customers, it also raises concerns. </p>\n\n<p>For example, a utility may not end up signing contracts directly with a large, well-known, wealthy technology company but with a subsidiary corporation with a more generic name – imagine something like “Westside Data Center LLC” – created solely to build and operate one data center. If the data center’s plans or technology changes, that subsidiary could declare bankruptcy, leaving the other customers with the remaining costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Harnessing strength in flexibility</h2>\n\n<p>A key advantage to these new types of customers is that they are extremely nimble in the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/03/texas-bitcoin-profit-electricity/\">way they use</a> electricity.</p>\n\n<p>If data centers can <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/03/texas-bitcoin-profit-electricity/\">make money based on their flexibility</a>, as they have in Texas, then a portion of those profits can be returned to the other customers that shared the investment risk. A similar mechanism is <a href=\"https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/missouri-new-data-center-rules-shielding-residents-from-infrastructure-and-power-costs/63-fae42629-d6c5-449d-a5c1-30bd77474039\">being implemented in Missouri</a>: If the utility makes extra money from large customers, then 65% of that revenue increase is returned to the other customers.</p>\n\n<p>Change is coming to the U.S. electricity system, but nobody is sure how much. The methods by which states are trying to allocate the cost of that uncertainty vary, but the critical element is understanding their respective strengths and weaknesses to craft a system that is fair for everyone.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271048/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Theodore Kury is the Director of Energy Studies at the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center, which is sponsored in part by the Florida electric and gas utilities, the Florida Public Service Commission and the Office of Public Counsel, the Consumer Advocate for the State.

Perhaps you went to bed too late, needed to wake up early or still felt tired when you woke up from what should have been a full night’s sleep. </p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the day, you feel groggy and unfocused. Things that are usually fun or exciting don’t give you the same level of pleasure. You don’t have energy to exercise, so you avoid it. You don’t feel motivated to see friends, so you cancel plans with them. You focus on your rough day as you try to fall asleep that night and start to have anxiety about the next day. Instead of getting the restful night of sleep you need, you have another night of poor sleep. You become caught in a vicious cycle of poor sleep and depressed mood.</p>\n\n<p>Sleep and mental health problems <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2018.10.006\">often go hand in hand</a>. Sleep problems are a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2008.10.3/dnutt\">core symptom of depression</a>. In addition, there is strong evidence that sleep problems <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30136-X\">contribute to many mental health disorders</a>, including schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. </p>\n\n<p>Yet our mental health also affects how well we sleep. Issues such as distressing thoughts and trouble relaxing can make it difficult for people to fall asleep or stay asleep, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-417188-6.00010-4\">exacerbating sleep problems</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These issues are particularly pronounced during pregnancy, when the circular effects of inadequate sleep and mental health challenges can have harmful effects for mothers and their offspring.</p>\n\n<p>We are a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wdoc1WsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">developmental psychologist</a> and a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Zf2uakAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">doctoral student</a> in psychology who study sleep and mental health from pregnancy through adulthood. As researchers in this field, we see the impacts of sleep and mental health problems firsthand.</p>\n\n<p>Sleep and mental health problems are so entangled that it is unsurprising that they can each make the other worse. But it does make treating them more challenging.</p>\n\n<h2>Biology of sleep and mental health</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers and medical professionals know that sleep is essential for the body and brain to function properly. </p>\n\n<p>Sleep is important for establishing <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/circadian-rhythm\">circadian rhythms</a>, which optimize alertness during the day and rest at night. When sunlight fades in the evening, the brain produces more of the hormone melatonin, and your core body temperature drops to promote sleep. When the brain detects sunlight, it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030037\">reduces melatonin production</a>, and body temperature increases to promote wakefulness. </p>\n\n<p>Although light and dark are the most important signals to the brain about when you should be awake and when you should be sleeping, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2016.09.001\">other things such as stress</a>, disruptions in daily routines and social interactions can also throw off your circadian rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>Circadian rhythms affect other important biological processes, including the body’s production of the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22187-cortisol\">stress hormone cortisol</a>. Cortisol follows a daily rhythm where it is highest soon after waking in the morning and lowest in the middle of the night. Disruptions in normal sleep can lead to difficulties in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coemr.2021.03.011\">daily regulation of cortisol levels</a>, which can have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.05.018\">negative effects on mental health</a> and the ability to effectively manage stress.</p>\n\n<p>Sleep is central to the proper functioning of the immune system, which in turn has implications for mental and physical health. Sleep disturbances have been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14738-9_1\">linked to poorer immune responses</a> against viruses and other challenges to the immune system, making it harder to stay healthy and to recover after getting sick. </p>\n\n<p>Sleep disturbances also lead to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">greater inflammation</a>, which is when the immune system’s natural responses become overactive. Inflammation underlies <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.04.015\">mental and physical health problems</a>, including depression, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11883-014-0435-z\">heart disease</a> and cancer.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZWLegof7GE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Without adequate sleep, cognitive functions suffer and emotional resilience weakens.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How poor sleep leads to behavior changes</h2>\n\n<p>Chronic disruptions to a person’s natural circadian rhythm – such as people who work night shifts or who switch between day and night shifts – lead to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-1131-z\">greater risk for both depression and anxiety</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Shift work is an extreme example of disrupting the natural pattern of sleeping at night. However, less severe types of sleep problems, such as not getting enough sleep or waking up feeling tired, are also bad for mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Sleep disruptions make it more difficult to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.12.006\">regulate emotions</a>. Having too little or poor quality sleep make handling everyday stressors more difficult. This is because sufficient sleep is necessary for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-012-0256-7\">effective problem-solving</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x\">memory and focusing</a>. The combination of impaired emotion regulation and stress management abilities are a recipe for greater mental health difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>One key reason why poor sleep and mental health struggles can become so problematic and difficult to treat is that without adequate sleep, it’s challenging to muster energy for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-10991-2\">healthy activities such as exercise</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05377-0\">maintaining social relationships</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, when decision-making is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/1076-898X.6.3.236\">impaired by poor sleep and negative emotions</a>, people are more likely to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2021.173153\">reach for alcohol, drugs</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sleep-loss-rewires-the-brain-for-cravings-and-weight-gain-a-neurologist-explains-the-science-behind-the-cycle-255726\">unhealthy foods</a> to cope with stress. These unhealthy behaviors can, in turn, reinforce the cycle by interfering with sleep.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F8wFkScnME?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a sleep study on healthy adults, researchers found that lack of sleep causes overactivity in the amygdala, a crucial area of the brain where emotional processing occurs.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Sleep and mental health problems in pregnancy</h2>\n\n<p>These cycles between poor sleep and mental health challenges can be especially problematic during pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>Common pregnancy symptoms include nausea, heartburn, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/back-pain-during-pregnancy-is-often-dismissed-as-a-passing-discomfort-a-nurse-explains-why-it-should-be-taken-seriously-and-treated-268264\">back and joint pain</a>, cramps, a frequent urge to pee and contractions, all of which can make it more difficult to get restful sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, around <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2014.12.006\">76% of pregnant women report having sleep problems</a> at some point in their pregnancy, <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/390536/sleep-in-america-2022.aspx\">compared with only 33%</a> in the general population. Relatedly, about 1 in 5 pregnant women in the U.S. struggle with <a href=\"https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/#362f83f1-eca7-47a9-9638-ae4ec8d6b8be\">mental health problems such as anxiety and depression</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our team’s new research, published in December 2025, further establishes these links between sleep and mental health. We found that during pregnancy, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xjmad.2025.100139\">mental health problems contribute to sleep problems</a> over time and that sleep problems in turn can exacerbate mental health problems.</p>\n\n<p>This cycle can also have negative effects on the fetus and on the child after birth. </p>\n\n<p>Prenatal sleep problems such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.1384\">short sleep, sleep apnea and restless sleep</a> can lead to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/texas-cities-have-some-of-the-highest-preterm-birth-rates-in-the-us-highlighting-maternal-health-crisis-nationwide-270251\">preterm births</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2019.1702551\">low birth weight</a> in newborns. </p>\n\n<p>A large study in Sweden in 2021 found that pregnant women who frequently worked the night shift or quickly shifted between night and day work in early pregnancy showed a three-to-four times <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab135\">greater risk for having a preterm birth</a>.

Together, they created a vertically integrated studio that would emulate the assembly line production of the auto industry: Films would be produced, distributed and shown under the same corporate umbrella.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.\">the Warner brothers</a> – had been pioneer theater owners during the <a href=\"https://edison.rutgers.edu/research/motion-picture-catalogs/catalogs-and-the-early-motion-picture-industry/the-early-nickelodeon-era\">nickelodeon era</a>, the period from roughly 1890 to 1915, when movie exhibition shifted from traveling shows to permanent, storefront theaters called nickelodeons.</p>\n\n<p>They used the financial backing of investment bank Goldman Sachs to follow Zucker’s Hollywood model. They merged their theaters with several independent production companies: <a href=\"https://warnerbros.fandom.com/wiki/Vitagraph_Studios\">the Vitagraph film distribution company</a>, <a href=\"https://greekreporter.com/2025/07/11/hollywood-greek-skouras/\">the Skouras Brothers theater chain</a> and, eventually, <a href=\"https://warnerbros.fandom.com/wiki/First_National_Pictures\">First National</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But the biggest of the Hollywood conglomerates was <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mgm-history-studio-founding-1235880683/\">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, created when the Loews theater chain merged Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures and Mayer Pictures. </p>\n\n<p>At its high point, MGM had the biggest stars of the day <a href=\"https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/624782/1/Doing%20the%20Deal_Carman_Drake.pdf\">under noncompete contracts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/MGM-Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-RULING-1930s-HOLLYWOOD-DEPRESSION-ERA-DOMINANCE.html\">accounted for roughly three-quarters of the entire industry’s gross revenues</a>. </p>\n\n<p>By the mid-1930s, a handful of vertically integrated studios dominated Hollywood – MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, RKO and 20th Century Fox – functioning like a state-sanctioned oligopoly. They controlled who worked, what films were made and what made it into the theaters they owned. And though the studios’ holdings came and went, the rules of the industry remained stable until after World War II.</p>\n\n<h2>Old Hollywood loses its cartel power</h2>\n\n<p>In 1938, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/drama-and-theater-arts/antitrust-rulings-force-film-studios-divest-theaters\">sued the “Big Five” studios</a>, arguing that their vertically integrated model was anti-competitive. </p>\n\n<p>After the Supreme Court decided in favor of the U.S. government in 1948 – in what became known as the <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep334/usrep334131/usrep334131.pdf\">Paramount Decision</a> – <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-decrees-antitrust-hollywood-1235581215/\">the studios were forced to sell off their theater chains</a>, which checked their ability to squeeze theaters and squeeze out independent producers. </p>\n\n<p>With the studios’ cartel power weakened, independent filmmakers like Elia Kazan and John Cassavetes flourished in the 1950s, making pictures like “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/\">On the Waterfront</a>” <a href=\"https://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9780809309566\">that the studios had rejected</a>. Foreign films found their ways to American screens no longer constrained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_booking\">block booking</a>, a practice that forced exhibitors to pay for a lot of mediocre films if they wanted the good ones, too. </p>\n\n<p>By the 1960s, a new generation of filmmakers like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001566/\">Mike Nichols</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/\">Stanley Kubrick</a> scored big with audiences hungry for something different than the escapist spectacles Hollywood was green-lighting. They took risks by hiring respected writers and unknown actors to tell stories that were truer to life. In doing so, they flipped Hollywood’s generic formulas upside down. </p>\n\n<p>A decade ago, I wrote about how Netflix’s streaming model <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/should-movie-studios-be-worried-about-netflixs-first-feature-film-47076\">pointed to a renaissance of innovative storytelling</a>, similar to the period after the Paramount Decision. </p>\n\n<p>By streaming their indie film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1365050/\">Beast of No Nation</a>” directly to subscribers at home, Netflix <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/should-movie-studios-be-worried-about-netflixs-first-feature-film-47076\">posed a direct threat to Hollywood’s blockbuster model</a>, in which studios invested heavily in a small number of big-budget films designed to earn enormous box office returns. At the time, Netflix’s 65 million global subscribers gave it the capital to produce exclusive content for its expanding markets.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood quickly closed the streaming gap, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/10/24/why-streaming-could-be-hollywoods-final-act/\">developing its own platforms</a> and restricting access of its vast catalogs to subscribers.</p>\n\n<h2>Warner Bros. bought and sold</h2>\n\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44492201\">AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner</a>, the biggest media conglomerate of the time, and DirectTV. It hoped to merge its 125 million-plus telecommunication customers with Time Warner’s content and create a streaming giant to compete with Netflix. </p>\n\n<p>Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, and the theatrical model for film distribution collapsed. </p>\n\n<p>The pressure on AT&amp;T’s stock led the company to sell off HBO and WarnerMedia to Discovery <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery\">in 2022 for $43 billion</a>. Armed with the HBO and Warner Bros. libraries – along with the advertising potential of CNN, TNT and Turner Sports – CEO David Zaslav <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/media/discovery-warner-media-merger-close/index.html\">was bullish about the company’s potential for growth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Warner Bros. Discovery became the third-largest streaming platform in terms of subscribers behind Netflix and Disney+, which had <a href=\"https://xpertegic.com/insights-disney-fox-what/\">gobbled up 20th Century Fox</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"YKfD7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YKfD7/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>But the results have been bad for audiences.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, Zaslav rolled out a bundled streaming platform called Max that <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/warner-bros-discovery-combined-streaming-offering-name-pricing/\">combined the libraries of HBO Max and Discovery+</a>, which ended up confusing consumers and the market. So it <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/07/09/hbo-max-changes-name-explainer-faq/84414231007/\">reverted back to HBO Max</a> because consumers recognized the brand. </p>\n\n<p>Zaslav then decided it was more cost effective to cancel innovative projects or write off completed films as losses. Zaslav often claims his deals are “<a href=\"https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901\">good for consumers</a>,” in that they get more content in one place. But conglomerates who defend their anti-competitive practices as signs of an efficient market that benefit “<a href=\"https://yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">consumer welfare</a>” frequently say that, even when they are making the product worse and limiting choices.  </p>\n\n<p>His deals have been especially bad for the television side, yielding <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tnt-tbs-scripted-programming-development-scrapped-warner-bros-discovery-1235241348/\">gutted newsrooms and canceled scripted shows</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Effectively, in only three years, the Warner Bros. Discovery merger has validated nearly all the concerns that <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/journalism-democracy-corporate-media-press/\">critics of “market first” policymaking have warned about for years</a>. Once it had a dominant market share, <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-has-more-bad-news-for-hbo-max-subscribers\">the company started providing less and charging more</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Older man smiles and waves while wearing sunglasses and a white baseball cap reading 'Max.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708217/original/file-20251211-62-yp7p37.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In 2023, Warner Bros.

Indeed, it has been squeezing its subscribers with <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/netflix-raising-prices-2025-rcna188702\">higher fees and more restrictive login protocols</a>. It’s a sign of what tech blogger Cory Doctorow describes as the logic of <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/20/capitalist-unrealism/\">“enshittification,”</a> whereby platforms that have locked in audiences and producers start to squeeze both. Buying the competition – HBO Max – will mean Netflix can charge even more. </p>\n\n<p>After the Netflix deal was announced, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/08/paramount-hostile-bid-warner-brothers-discovery-30-per-share-netflix-antitrust/\">Paramount joined forces</a> with President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Saudi Sovereign Wealth fund and others to announce a hostile counteroffer.</p>\n\n<p>Now, all bets are off. Whichever platform acquires Warner Bros. will have enormous power over the kind of stories that get sold and told. </p>\n\n<p>In either case, Warner Bros. would be bought by a direct competitor. The Department of Justice, under the first Trump administration, <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2025/12/10/why-is-warner-bros-for-sale-at-all/\">already pushed to sunset the Paramount Decision</a>, claiming that the distribution model had changed to such an extent that it was unlikely that Hollywood could ever reinstate its cartel. It’s hard to imagine that Trump 2.0 will forbid more media concentration, especially if the new parent company is friendly to the administration.</p>\n\n<p>No matter which bidder becomes the belle of Trump’s ballroom, this merger illustrates how show business works: When dominant platforms also own the studios and their assets, they control the fate of the movie business – of actors, writers, producers and theaters.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the concentration is taking place as artificial intelligence threatens to displace many aspects of film production.

These are built primarily from carbon and hydrogen, and they often form the backbone of life’s chemistry.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists have predicted that early asteroids may have delivered the ingredients of life to Earth, and these findings seemed like promising evidence. </p>\n\n<p>Even more surprising, these amino acids from Bennu were split almost evenly between “left-handed” and “right-handed” forms. Amino acids come in two mirror-image configurations, just like our left and right hands, called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/life14030341\">chiral forms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Earth, almost all biology requires the left-handed versions. If scientists had found a strong left-handed excess in Bennu, it would have suggested that life’s molecular asymmetry might have been inherited directly from space. Instead, the near-equal mixture points to a different story: Life’s left-handed preference likely emerged later, through processes on Earth, rather than being pre-imprinted in the material delivered by asteroids.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two hands with two molecules that are mirror images of each other shown over them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=512&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=512&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707490/original/file-20251209-56-nmnai5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=512&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A ‘chiral’ molecule is one that is not superposable with another that is its mirror image, even if you rotate it.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality#/media/File:Chirality_with_hands.svg\">NASA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>If space rocks can carry familiar ingredients but not the chemical “signature” that life leaves behind, then identifying the true signs of biology becomes extremely complicated.</p>\n\n<p>These discoveries raise a deeper question – one that becomes more urgent as new missions <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nasas-search-for-life-on-mars-a-rocky-road-for-its-rovers-a-long-slog-for-scientists-and-back-on-earth-a-battle-of-the-budget-207698\">target Mars</a>, the Martian moons and the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/saturns-ocean-moon-enceladus-is-able-to-support-life-my-research-team-is-working-out-how-to-detect-extraterrestrial-cells-there-226286\">ocean worlds</a> <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/jupiters-moons-hide-giant-subsurface-oceans-europa-clipper-is-one-of-2-missions-on-their-way-to-see-if-these-moons-could-support-life-203207\">of our solar system</a>: How do researchers detect life when the chemistry alone begins to look “lifelike”? If nonliving materials can produce rich, organized mixtures of organic molecules, then the traditional signs we use to recognize biology may no longer be enough. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=87wBxzUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a computational scientist</a> studying biological signatures, I face this challenge directly. In my astrobiology work, I ask how to determine whether a collection of molecules was formed by complex geochemistry or by extraterrestrial biology, when exploring other planets.</p>\n\n<p>In a new study in the journal <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf334\">PNAS Nexus</a>, my colleagues and I developed a framework called LifeTracer to help answer this question. Instead of searching for a single molecule or structure that proves the presence of biology, we attempted to classify how likely mixtures of compounds preserved in rocks and meteorites were to contain traces of life by examining the full chemical patterns they contain.</p>\n\n<h2>Identifying potential biosignatures</h2>\n\n<p>The key idea behind our framework is that life produces molecules with purpose, while nonliving chemistry does not. Cells must store energy, build membranes and transmit information. <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biology/biotic-and-abiotic-factors\">Abiotic chemistry</a> produced by nonliving chemical processes, even when abundant, follows different rules because it is not shaped by metabolism or evolution.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional biosignature approaches focus on searching for specific compounds, such as certain amino acids or lipid structures, or for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00474\">chiral preferences, like left-handedness</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These signals can be powerful, but they are based entirely on the molecular patterns <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/extraterrestrial-life-may-look-nothing-like-life-on-earth-so-astrobiologists-are-coming-up-with-a-framework-to-study-how-complex-systems-evolve-243531\">used by life on Earth</a>. If we <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-do-astronomers-look-for-signs-of-life-on-other-planets-based-on-what-life-is-like-on-earth-227658\">assume that alien life uses the same chemistry</a>, we risk missing biology that is similar – but not identical – to our own, or misidentifying nonliving chemistry as a sign of life. </p>\n\n<p>The Bennu results highlight this problem. The asteroid sample contained molecules familiar to life, yet nothing within it appears to have been alive.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the risk of assuming these molecules indicate life, we assembled a unique dataset of organic materials right at the dividing line between life and nonlife. We used samples from eight <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2025.0017\">carbon-rich meteorites</a> that preserve abiotic chemistry from the early solar system, as well as 10 samples of soils and sedimentary materials from Earth, containing the degraded remnants of biological molecules from past or present life. Each sample contained tens of thousands of organic molecules, many present in low abundance and many whose structures could not be fully identified.</p>\n\n<p>At NASA’s <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/\">Goddard Space Flight Center</a>, our team of scientists crushed each sample, added solvent and heated it to extract the organics — this process is like brewing tea. Then, we took the “tea” containing the extracted organics and passed it through two filtering columns that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43586-024-00379-3\">separated the complex mixture of organic molecules</a>. Then, the organics were pushed into a chamber where we bombarded them with electrons until they broke into smaller fragments. </p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, chemists use these mass fragments as puzzle pieces to reconstruct each molecular structure, but having tens of thousands of compounds in each sample presented a challenge.</p>\n\n<h2>LifeTracer</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://life-tracer.github.io\">LifeTracer</a> is a unique approach for data analysis: It works by taking in the fragmented puzzle pieces and analyzing them to find specific patterns, rather than reconstructing each structure.</p>\n\n<p>It characterizes those puzzle pieces by their mass and two other chemical properties and then organizes them into a large matrix describing the set of molecules present in each sample. It then trains a machine learning model to distinguish between the meteorites and the terrestrial materials from Earth’s surface, based on the type of molecules present in each.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most common forms of machine learning is called supervised learning. It works by taking many input and output pairs as examples and learns a rule to go from input to output. Even with only 18 samples as those examples, LifeTracer performed remarkably well. It consistently separated abiotic from biotic origins.</p>\n\n<p>What mattered most to LifeTracer was not the presence of a specific molecule but the overall distribution of chemical fingerprints found in each sample. Meteorite samples tended to contain more volatile compounds – they evaporate or break apart more easily – which reflected the type of chemistry most common in the cold environment of space. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A graph showing a cluster of dots representing molecules, some in red and some in blue.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=412&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=412&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=412&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707922/original/file-20251210-74-oq0jdu.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">This figure shows compounds identified by LifeTracer, highlighting the most predictive molecular fragments that distinguish abiotic from biotic samples.

After donors put money or other financial assets into these accounts, the assets are technically no longer theirs. But they do get a say in how those funds are invested, as well as when and which charities should get some of the money. \nAmericans <a href=\"https://www.dafresearchcollaborative.org/annual-daf-report/2025\">gave nearly US$90 billion</a> to DAFs in 2024 – up from the <a href=\"https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/philanthropist/npt-releases-2015-donor-advised-fund-report/\">$20 billion</a> DAFs took in a decade earlier.</p>\n\n<p>One distinguishing feature about DAF donors is that when they dispatch money from their charitable accounts, they fund politically engaged charities at higher rates than people who give directly to charity.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CZNgsUsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">we, two</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rap6TboAAAAJ\">scholars</a> who research the flow of money between donors and nonprofits, found when we conducted a study examining the links between donor-advised funds and donations to charities that are politically active.

But because DAFs are accounts held within certified public charities, often those affiliated with financial institutions like Fidelity and Vanguard, they offer added tax benefits and simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>DAFs let donors take <a href=\"https://www.nptrust.org/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund/daf-tax-consideration/\">charitable tax deductions</a> immediately, and then decide later how much of that money to give to which charity – and when – by telling the account managers what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Timing gifts this way can increase the <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/charity/tax-smart-donor-advised-fund-daf-strategies-for-financial-advisers\">tax advantages tied to charitable giving</a> through tax deductions. And DAFs help donors do this without the <a href=\"https://www.craincurrency.com/philanthropy/family-office-philanthropy-how-decide-between-daf-and-private-foundation\">expenses, staffing and complexity</a> of running their own foundations.</p>\n\n<p>These advantages – <a href=\"https://www.investmentnews.com/ria-news/janney-aims-for-slice-of-estimated-52b-daf-market-with-new-charitable-fund/257696\">coupled with persuasive marketing campaigns</a> – have helped spur a DAF boom. Donor-advised funds <a href=\"https://www.dafresearchcollaborative.org/annual-daf-report/2025\">held $326 billion in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7N6O1lV6aQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A proponent of donor-advised funds explains how they work and why many donors like to use them.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>More politically engaged charitable activity</h2>\n\n<p>We consider charities “politically engaged” if they <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-may-engage-in-advocacy-and-limited-lobbying-but-few-do-so-new-research-210427\">either do lobbying</a> or have related organizations that participate in <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/faq\">political campaigning</a>. These groups span the political spectrum: For example, they include both the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-the-nra-an-educational-organization-a-lobby-group-a-nonprofit-a-media-outlet-yes-92806\">National Rifle Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/\">Environmental Defense Fund</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We gathered data from the nearly 250,000 <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations\">charities in the U.S.</a> that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019\">filed a 990 form</a> with the Internal Revenue Service from 2020 to 2022. The country’s largest charities <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-series-which-forms-do-exempt-organizations-file-filing-phase-in\">must file these informational forms annually</a> and make them available to the public.</p>\n\n<p>When we crunched the numbers, we discovered that nearly 6% of payments from DAF accounts go to politically engaged charities. In comparison, other funding sources paid out only 3.6% to politically engaged charities.</p>\n\n<p>This means a funding rate from DAFs is <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/npf-2024-0028/html\">1.7 times</a> the benchmark level. When it comes to fringe <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map\">hate and antigovernment charities</a>, overall funding levels are low, but the DAF difference is more pronounced – DAF donors fund these groups at a rate 3.5 times that of other donors.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"4C1ON\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4C1ON/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Giving donors more privacy</h2>\n\n<p>One other advantage DAFs offer donors is that they provide more anonymity than if donors give to a cause directly.</p>\n\n<p>Under current disclosure rules, when donors give <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i990sb/\">more than $5,000</a> to any charitable nonprofit – whether it’s their local food bank or animal shelter or art museum – both the charity and the IRS have to know who they are. When donors give that much to private foundations, it <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i990pf\">becomes part of the public record</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>But when donors give any amount, even if it’s much more than $5,000, through their DAFs, even the charity that ultimately gets the money <a href=\"https://www.aefonline.org/thought-leadership/why-clients-decide-donate-publicly-or-anonymously/\">may not know the donor’s identity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/silent-donor-tim-sanders-daf-privacy-9e499583181ed0c8b7d6685fbea31ecb\">anonymity may be one reason</a> donors more often <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2025/07/04/how-the-justin-baldoni-blake-lively-saga-led-a-billionaire-to-shut-down-his-foundation/\">use DAFs</a> to give to organizations that engage in politics, either directly or indirectly. </p>\n\n<p>To be sure, charities are permitted to engage in <a href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/political-campaign-activities-risks-tax-exempt-status\">different types of political engagement to varying degrees</a>. In fact, U.S. charities have long been important <a href=\"https://www.detroitphilanthropy.com/communityblog/charitable-nonprofits-and-a-history-rooted-in-advocacy\">public policy advocates</a>. And it is also understandable that donors might want to be anonymous. Yet the use of DAFs to provide gifts to fringe groups suggests this lack of transparency is not always a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>The rules around donor disclosure were <a href=\"https://histphil.org/2020/01/22/the-private-foundation-rules-at-fifty-how-did-we-get-there/\">originally set up</a> to prevent private interests from abusing the system.</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason that foundations – like those set up by tech billionaire <a href=\"https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/elon-musk-may-not-be-your-typical-billionaire-but-his-giving-exhibits-familiar-trends\">Elon Musk</a> or Google co-founder <a href=\"https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/larry-page-s-6.7-billion-foundation-directs-almost-all-grants-to-dafs\">Larry Page</a> – must <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-contributors-identities-not-subject-to-disclosure\">publicly disclose</a> both their major donors and their grant recipients.</p>\n\n<p>But when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/us/politics/elon-musk-foundation.html\">these foundations make grants</a> to donor-advised funds, the <a href=\"https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/resource/when-private-foundations-give-through-dafs-exploring-the-how-and-why-of-this-practice/\">digital trail becomes a dead end</a>. The public has no way to know which charities the foundations are ultimately funding with their grants after the money enters a DAF’s coffers.</p>\n\n<p>Consistent with this arrangement, <a href=\"https://inequality.org/article/donor-advised-funds-political-engagement/\">we found that the DAFs that get more grants</a> from foundations tend to fund politically active organizations at higher rates.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CV5u0\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CV5u0/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Changing the charity landscape</h2>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.bgca.org/news-stories/2024/October/why-donor-advised-funds-are-the-future-of-charitable-giving/\">DAFs continue to expand</a>, further research can help cast light on what effect they will ultimately have. Though <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0899764019856118\">much research</a> and many <a href=\"https://cof.org/content/summary-accelerating-charitable-efforts-act-ace-act\">proposed new rules</a> have focused on whether Americans need to move the money in their DAFs out to charities more quickly, we’re focused on where that money goes.</p>\n\n<p>In examining tax filings, we <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4683236\">have also learned</a> that some charitable sectors get more money from DAFs than others.</p>\n\n<p>For example, social service nonprofits, which include homeless shelters and food banks, get 25% of all giving, but only 20% of DAF giving. This may seem like a small difference, but it can actually represent seismic shifts in where charitable dollars go.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5401950\">we’re now examining</a> whether the size of a charity’s DAF program can influence that organization’s behavior. The data collected from 990 forms suggests that even community foundations may become less focused on their local communities when they court DAF donors.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270758/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Helen Flannery is employed by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank that has done research related to charity reforms.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brian Mittendorf does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Some <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/ivf-and-the-package-deal-marriage-sex-and-procreation\">conservative Christians oppose IVF</a> because it often involves <a href=\"https://whyy.org/segments/after-ivf-what-happens-to-remaining-embryos/\">destroying extra embryos</a> not implanted in the woman’s uterus.</p>\n\n<p>According to Politico, anti-abortion groups <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/25/the-pro-life-movement-still-has-some-real-juice-how-trumps-promise-of-free-ivf-fizzled-00622464\">lobbied against a requirement for employers to cover IVF</a>. Instead, some vouched for “restorative reproductive medicine” – a term that has been around for decades but has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/trump-ivf-restorative-reproductive-medicine.html?searchResultPosition=1\">received much more attention</a>, especially from conservatives, in the past few months. </p>\n\n<p>Proponents of restorative reproductive medicine tend to present it as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dueling-approaches-infertility-vie-congress-attention-rcna231793\">an alternative to IVF</a>: a different way of treating infertility, focused on treating underlying causes. But the approach is controversial, and some practitioners closely link their treatments to Catholic teachings.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/health-humanities/faculty/biodetail.html?mail=emma.kennedy@villanova.edu&amp;xsl=bio_long\">a scholar of religion</a>, I study U.S. Catholics’ varied perspectives on infertility, seeking to understand how religious beliefs and practices influence physicians’ and patients’ choices. Their perspectives help provide a more nuanced understanding of Christianity’s role in the U.S. reproductive and political landscape.</p>\n\n<h2>Defining restorative reproductive medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Clinics that advertise themselves as offering restorative reproductive medicine try to <a href=\"https://iirrm.org/what-is-rrm/\">diagnose underlying issues</a> that could make conception difficult, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656\">like endometriosis</a>. Typically, a patient and provider will closely monitor the patient’s menstrual cycle to identify potential abnormalities.

However, restorative reproductive medicine clinics do not typically offer IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on who you ask, proponents are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/aug/23/restorative-reproductive-medicine-ivf\">not necessarily opposed to IVF</a>; they see their treatments as another option to explore. Some clinicians, however, closely link their treatment offerings to <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/bb9290093843b4b3b5519ef6d72c2ebd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y\">their religious commitments</a> and opposition to abortion. </p>\n\n<p>Restorative reproductive medicine has prompted criticism from professional medical organizations. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine <a href=\"https://www.asrm.org/advocacy-and-policy/fact-sheets-and-one-pagers/just-the-facts-restorative-reproductive-medicine-and-ethical-ivf-are-misleading-terms-that-threaten-access/\">issued a statement</a> in May 2025 calling it a “rebranding” of standard infertility treatment, with “ideologically driven restrictions that could limit patient care.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/advocacy/abortion-is-essential/trending-issues/issue-brief-restorative-reproductive-medicine\">issued a brief warning</a> that it is a “nonmedical approach” that threatens to impede access to IVF. </p>\n\n<p>These critics are concerned that the focus on lifestyle changes and surgery <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/advocacy/abortion-is-essential/trending-issues/issue-brief-restorative-reproductive-medicine\">may not address patients’ difficulties conceiving</a>, while putting them through other unsuccessful treatments. </p>\n\n<h2>Church teachings</h2>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://stateline.org/2025/08/25/as-republicans-spar-over-ivf-some-turn-to-obscure-maha-backed-alternative/\">restorative reproductive medicine</a> is often described as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/trump-ivf-restorative-reproductive-medicine.html\">gaining steam</a> with conservative Christians and the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-the-washington-post-survey-of-parents-polling-insights-on-the-maha-movement/\">“Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement</a>. Its roots, though, are decades old, and largely Catholic. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the Catholic Church’s <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html\">objection to IVF</a> stems from a concern that unused embryos are often <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/20/489232868/after-ivf-some-struggle-with-what-to-do-with-leftover-embryos\">discarded and destroyed</a>. The church’s position is that all embryos ought to be treated with the same respect afforded a person – one of the key reasons its teachings oppose abortion.</p>\n\n<p>Disapproval of IVF also stems from the church’s official teachings on marriage. According to this teaching, marriage has two chief ends, which it calls “procreation and union”: Typically, procreation is understood to mean having children, while union involves physical, emotional and spiritual intimacy. In this understanding, sexual intercourse should preserve what the church calls an <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html\">“inseparable connection”</a> between these two meanings.</p>\n\n<p>The Catholic Church <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html\">opposes artificial contraception</a> because its goal is to block procreation. Instead, Catholics are encouraged to use “Natural Family Planning” – tracking a woman’s cycle so that couples can choose to abstain from sex during fertile periods. Similarly, it opposes artificial insemination and IVF because, by moving fertilization out of the body and into the lab, the process separates procreation from the act of sexual intercourse. </p>\n\n<p>Survey data suggests <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/09/26/many-catholics-in-the-us-and-latin-america-want-the-church-to-allow-birth-control-and-to-let-women-become-priests/\">most U.S. Catholics do not agree</a> <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/08/15/abortion-viewed-in-moral-terms/\">with these official stances</a>, nor do they follow them. </p>\n\n<p>Catholic doctors who do agree with official church teachings, however, have played a key role in developing infertility treatments that <a href=\"https://saintpaulvi.com/ethics/\">align with them</a>. One of the most influential is <a href=\"https://saintpaulvi.com/thomaswhilgers/\">Dr. Thomas W. Hilgers</a>, who co-developed a “Natural Family Planning” method called the <a href=\"https://creightonmodel.com/\">Creighton Model</a>. In the early 1990s, he also developed <a href=\"https://naprotechnology.com/\">NaProTechnology</a>, an approach that seeks to identify fertility issues using cycle tracking, and then treat them with various medical and surgical interventions.</p>\n\n<p>The NaProTechnology approach could be said to fall under the umbrella of restorative reproductive medicine, but it has mostly been used by <a href=\"https://stgiannacenter.com/\">Catholic reproductive health clinics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.osfhealthcare.org/services/specialties/women/programs-services/fertility-care/faith-based-fertility-solutions\">hospitals</a>. Catholic <a href=\"https://mycatholicdoctor.com/our-services/naprotechnology/\">physicians’ networks</a> promote it, as do <a href=\"https://olchesapeake.org/naprotechnology\">parishes</a> and <a href=\"https://scd.org/family-and-faith-formation/how-fertilitycare-and-naprotechnolgoy-can-help-infertility\">dioceses</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Navigating infertility</h2>\n\n<p>For Catholics who share the church’s official perspective on IVF, NaProTechnology and the clinics offering it are often a welcome alternative. <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/bb9290093843b4b3b5519ef6d72c2ebd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y\">Several of the Catholic women I interviewed</a> as part of my academic research had also been to mainstream fertility clinics, but they felt that those providers did not offer much apart from IVF. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the clinics offering NaProTechnology were often cheaper, in part because they do not offer IVF.

Some felt that those clinics were focused on profit – a concern <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14636778.2019.1709430\">shared by some scholars</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01484-3/fulltext\">scrutinizing</a> the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12958-025-01446-4\">fertility industry</a>.

The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/50-years-after-jaws-researchers-have-retired-the-man-eater-myth-and-revealed-more-about-sharks-amazing-biology-258151\">1975 movie “Jaws</a>” and its portrayal of a great white shark as a mindless killing machine didn’t help people’s perceptions.</p>\n\n<p>One reason <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international-affairs/shark-conservation\">shark populations are so vulnerable</a> to overfishing, and less capable of recovering, is the late timing of their sexual maturity and their low numbers of offspring. If sharks and rays don’t survive long enough, the species can’t reproduce enough new members to remain stable.</p>\n\n<p>Losing these species is a global problem because they are <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international-affairs/shark-conservation\">vital for a healthy ocean</a>, in large part because they help keep their prey in check.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yw2iIWQ9i9c?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The bowmouth guitarfish, shown here at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, is considered critically endangered.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Endangered and <a href=\"https://www.iucnssg.org/iucnredlist.html\">threatened species listings</a>, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, can help draw attention to sharks and rays that are at risk. But because their populations span international borders, with migratory routes around the globe, sharks and rays need international protection, not just local efforts.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why the international trade agreements set out by the <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\">Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species</a>, or CITES, are vital. The convention attempts to create global restrictions that prevent trade of protected species to give them a chance to survive.</p>\n\n<h2>New protections for sharks and rays</h2>\n\n<p>In early December 2025, the CITES Conference of the Parties, made up of representatives from 184 countries, voted to initiate or expand protection against trade for many species. The votes included adding <a href=\"https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/25665/WCS-Celebrates-Historic-and-Sweeping-Trade-Protections-for-Sharks-and-Rays-Adopted-at-CITES-CoP20.aspx\">more than 70 shark and ray species</a> to the CITES lists for full or restricted protection.</p>\n\n<p>The newly listed or upgraded species include some of the most charismatic shark and ray species.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/whale-shark/\">whale shark</a>, one of only three filter-feeding sharks and the largest fish in the ocean, and the <a href=\"https://www.mantatrust.org/manta-and-devil-ray-species\">manta and devil rays</a> have joined the list that offers the strictest restrictions on trade, called Appendix I. Whale sharks are at risk from overfishing as well as being struck by ships. Because they feed at the surface, chasing zooplankton blooms, these ocean giants can be hit by ships, especially now that these animals are considered a tourism must-see.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707967/original/file-20251210-57-50bcl5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A manta ray swims with its mouth open.

Most have one AirPod in listening to whatever their Spotify AI DJ thinks they want to listen to; some scroll past AI-selected ads for drop-shipped fast fashion. And then someone who has forgotten to silence their phone opens TikTok and the <a href=\"https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/6-7-original-47162/\">6-7 second</a> sound blares. They hurriedly close the app, no apology, not even a half-hearted laugh from their classmates. </p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the contemporary college classroom. </p>\n\n<p>I am a college professor working at the intersection of humanities and artificial intelligence, and yes, I believe the latter not only threatens to devalue college, but it also risks stripping humanity from our lives altogether.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. AI automating away parts of work and life challenges the next generation of the workforce to re-instill the importance of interpersonal social skills, and I see the college classroom as the ideal place for this rehumanization to take place. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s my framework for building a classroom centered around student socialization. The goal: Equip students with the vital human skills needed in the AI-augmented workforce.</p>\n\n<h2>Target: Bring humanity to work</h2>\n\n<p>Young adults sit in college classes fully aware that an AI-infused workplace is just on the other side of graduation. But they – and everyone else – have little idea how best to prepare for it.</p>\n\n<p>How to make this work for today’s college students? Known for the infamous <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-clarity/202507/the-psychology-driving-the-gen-z-stare\">Gen Z stare</a>, having their faces glued to their screens, and their fidgeting, doomscrolling thumbs, Gen Z has been pegged as the generation that lacks the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kids-need-soft-skills-in-the-age-of-ai-but-what-does-this-mean-for-schools-261518\">social skills needed to succeed in an AI-augmented workforce</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>To me, this represents a clear tension between the young adults they are and the adults they need to be. </p>\n\n<p>It’s easy for my rhetoric to give off “kids these days” vibes. But I’m a young millennial. Which is to say, I too don’t know what to do with my hands at dinner parties and have to make a conscious effort to maintain eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put: I teach what I wish I would have been taught. </p>\n\n<h2>Shifting the mentality of the classroom</h2>\n\n<p>In the college classroom, it’s all too easy to talk at the students for 90 minutes – to just be a professor with a slide deck who tosses in a few canned jokes that you know work because you’ve already said them a dozen times. Time passes, and you hear the next class waiting outside the door. </p>\n\n<p>“All right, y'all,” you say. “Let’s get outta here.” </p>\n\n<p>The students dash off to their dorm rooms or dining hall, and wait to do the homework until midnight. You wait a few weeks too long to grade it – also at midnight, right before midterm grades are due – like two digital ships passing each other in the moonlight. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, I offer a different mindset: The classroom is not some intermediary between two computers – the assignment creator and the assignment doer, which only serves to build an “us versus them” mentality between student and professor.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, it’s us together in the battle against the midterm or final exam. </p>\n\n<p>“OK, that sounds great, random guy on the internet,” I hear you say from the other side of the screen. “But how?” </p>\n\n<h2>Small social interactions</h2>\n\n<p>We academics like to use fancy words phrases like “student-centered classroom” or “student-driven approach.” What this means for me is simple: I constantly interact with the students and make social interactions integral to the classroom experience.</p>\n\n<p>I used to hear professors brag about knowing each of their students’ names, so I made it a priority to do the same. But now I don’t think that’s enough. Instead, I’m asking the frat bros-future-businessmen and the honors-society-students-soon-to-be-doctors to get to know each other as peers and future colleagues. </p>\n\n<p>As I shuffle into class and try to remember if I capitalized my first pet’s name as I log into the computer, I simply ask students to tell each other: What was the most challenging question on the homework? What did you do this weekend? And more importantly, what did you wish you did?</p>\n\n<p>At the end of class, I give five minutes for students to plan out when they’re going to complete the homework, and then I have them talk to the person next to them about it. </p>\n\n<p>These conversations often lead to friendships formed over common struggles: Alex would love to do his English paper tonight but has to study for his bio test, and Professor Smith’s exams are the worst. As luck has it, James is also in the lecture. “Man, you’re in the class too? Where do you sit? Professor Smith talks way too fast!”  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three female college students work together at a computer.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707943/original/file-20251210-62-a5dj7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Social interactions in class can be a vital place to teach crucial social skills.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/classmates-working-on-project-royalty-free-image/2149691948?phrase=college%20students%20hanging%20out&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm\">Visual Vic via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Centering the importance of public speaking</h2>\n\n<p>Sure, in my writing-intensive classes we turn in term papers, they get grades, and yes, some students use AI. That’s all fine and well, but that’s not the important part. Instead, I’m interested in students knowing the material well enough to articulate it to the group – well enough to tell us why the subject matters to them, to us and to the world at large. </p>\n\n<p>So we spend a week where students give a short 5-10 minute presentation on their work. “Tell us why fast fashion is destroying the planet. Tell me why we need to care more about the future of pork and factory farming practices.” </p>\n\n<p>And for those brief moments of positive peer pressure as the students stand at the front of the class, it doesn’t matter that ChatGPT helped with the commas, did the googling or even wrote the entire conclusion because “I was just getting too tired.” What matters is the students’ ability to look a group of 20 peers in the eye and bring the private work of thinking, writing and sometimes even chatbot-prompting into the public sphere.</p>\n\n<p>The point isn’t whether students used AI to compose the words; it’s whether the ideas feel like they originate from the person behind the words. Whether they’ve wrestled with them long enough to know what they’re trying to say. If ChatGPT helped them get there, fine. What matters is what they did after. Did they question it? Did they revise it? Did they decide it wasn’t quite right and try again? </p>\n\n<p>That’s the work I care about. To me, it’s the difference between turning something in and actually turning something over — in your mind, in your hands, to the people around you. That’s what makes it real. What makes it theirs. What makes it college.</p>\n\n<h2>Back in the classroom …</h2>\n\n<p>It’s week 12. I just sent my students off into a small-group discussion on “the value of adapting AI-augmented practices into your daily life.” Five minutes go by. “All right, y'all, let’s bring it back in.” But no one stops talking. </p>\n\n<p>And in that small moment as I pull my phone out to play the Snapchat notification sound, Rizzlord soundtrack or whatever the sound meme of the day is to get their attention, I know I’ve done my small part as an educator: teaching students how to be human again.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269168/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sean Cho Ayres does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Then, design ideas and draft art are solicited from <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/learn/artists\">medallic artists at the U.S. Mint</a>, who create the raised, three-dimensional designs that are sculpted into models.</p>\n\n<p>Two groups – the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, which <a href=\"https://www.ccac.gov/system/files/2025-03/STATUTE-117-Pg615.pdf\">exists to advise the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury</a> on the designs of all U.S. coins and medals, and the federal Commission of Fine Arts, which <a href=\"https://www.cfa.gov/about-cfa\">provides advice to the federal government on matters of design and aesthetics</a>, including memorials, buildings and coins – work together over time, including through public meetings, to review proposed designs and recommend revisions and selections of specific designs.</p>\n\n<p>The recommendations of the advisory committee and the commission have in the past proved valuable to shaping the final depictions portrayed in coin engravings, but the final authority and decisions come from the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In the case of the America 250 coins, the designs were discussed across multiple meetings in 2024, with <a href=\"https://www.cfa.gov/records-research/project-search/cfa-17-oct-24-6\">the final report from the Commission of Fine Arts</a> published on Oct. 24, 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The final recommendations were for a dime that bears a “Liberty Over Tyranny” design; five quarters that would have the “Declaration of Independence,” “U.S. Constitution,” “Abolitionism,” “Suffrage” and “Civil Rights” as their respective designs; and a half-dollar that would bear a “Participatory Democracy” design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why the big switch?</h2>\n\n<p>The original dime and half-dollar images remained unchanged in the officially accepted designs unveiled on Dec. 10, 2025. However, all quarter designs were changed, eliminating the proposed images representing the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Abolitionism, Suffrage and Civil Rights, with the exception of the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No official explanation for these changes were provided during the U.S. Mint’s design unveiling event. But it is not hard to see how the nation’s current political climate, in which President Donald Trump has complained that the Smithsonian focuses too much on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/trump-smithsonian-slavery.html\">“how bad slavery was” and not enough on the “brightness”</a> of the country’s history, may have played a role.</p>\n\n<p>This is significant for two primary reasons. One, the process for choosing the design was supposed to reflect public input, via the public meetings with the two advisory committees regarding these changes. But these fundamental changes were ultimately decided by the Secretary of the Treasury out of the public eye, likely in concert with other members of the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p>Second, these changes of the America 250 quarters reinforce a more traditional and exclusionary view of nation’s founding and continued progress. The new designs sideline Americans’ historical struggle against oppression and social injustice and are demonstrative of the Trump administration’s collective efforts to bar government statements and initiatives <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dei-trump-executive-order-diversity-834a241a60ee92722ef2443b62572540\">related to diversity, equity and inclusion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The selective editing of American memory portrayed on the America 250 coins is not only a breach in established process, but it’s also a missed opportunity to provide new and diverse representation in an easy, yet meaningful, way.</p>\n\n<h2>Public memory in your pocket</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since the <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history?srsltid=AfmBOorzjoXuU0ukx2wY_LSX2C6oTaOq0Mek0EcPdZldo5y-hXwiQeA0\">U.S. Mint opened in Philadelphia in 1792</a>, coins and currency with depictions of American figures, symbolic representations and iconic inscriptions have circulated throughout the nation and the world.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/quarter/50-state-quarters\">Fifty States Quarters program</a>, which ran from 1999 to 2008, was very popular among Americans who appreciated seeing different designs on quarters that were emblematic of their own state’s identity. For example, the Vermont version of the quarter included an image of <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/quarter/50-state-quarters/vermont\">Camel’s Hump Mountain and maple trees</a> with sap buckets hung on them.</p>\n\n<p>Scholars have argued that coins and currency are examples of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.09.007\">everyday or banal nationalism</a>, which refers to the often unnoticed expressions of national identity that persist throughout material culture and society.</p>\n\n<p>Coins occupy sparing yet evident moments throughout our lives. You can find them in routine places, with little attention given to their presence, such as the bottom of your junk drawer, in the cup holder in your car or abandoned on the sidewalk.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman's hand holding coins.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708250/original/file-20251211-56-didduc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">What coins do you have in your pocket?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-holds-change-in-palm-of-hand-royalty-free-image/1289767855?phrase=coins%20U.S.%20nickels%20quarters&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Grace Cary, Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MCd89PAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">cultural geographers like me</a>, coins serve as vessels of passive and active public memory. They subtly signal values and reinforce figures and events as important to American culture and history by being portrayed on government-issued coins.</p>\n\n<p>This understanding further highlights the significance of the recent design changes to the America 250 coins. The removal of imagery of women, people of color and historic events important to marginalized people are not subtle choices.</p>\n\n<p>Whether someone is an active coin collector or just looking to buy a candy bar at a convenience store, all people participate in the reproduction of American public memory. And they do this regardless of which narratives of public memory are chosen to be shared by the federal government. </p>\n\n<h2>What comes next?</h2>\n\n<p>Recent controversies regarding the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-wins-and-who-loses-as-the-us-retires-the-penny-267380\">end of production of the U.S. penny</a> and the proposal for a new one-dollar coin <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/us/trump-commemorative-coin.html\">commemorating President Donald Trump</a> illustrate the American public’s continued interest and attention to coins and currency despite an increasingly digital age. The redesign of these America 250 coins is yet another story in this ongoing saga.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n  <em>\n    <strong>\n      Read more:\n      <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-wins-and-who-loses-as-the-us-retires-the-penny-267380\">Who wins and who loses as the US retires the penny</a>\n    </strong>\n  </em>\n</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<p>Historically, designs of coins or currency that are <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/07/disobedient-objects-at-the-victoria-and-albert-museum-looks-at-currency-tampering-and-politically-subversive-design-photos.html\">unpopular with the general public are ripe for being defaced</a>, such as the scratching out of public figures or the complete destruction of the piece.</p>\n\n<p>Although sometimes illegal, such an act sends a powerful political message of subversion against the government. This tends to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-63159685\">more common in other nations</a>, beyond minor graffiti drawn onto paper currency in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>If the U.S. Mint maintains the <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/product-schedule/2025/\">product schedule of previous years</a>, the America 250 coins should begin to circulate in February 2026. It may take time for the coins to arrive at banks, and even longer for them to show up as change from grocery stores, convenience shops and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you believe in the appropriateness of the new designs or not, the coins and their backstory can serve as a prompt for discussion with friends and family, or even educating children, about what it means to be an American. The power – and the coins – will soon be in your hands.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271811/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Seth T.

High costs of housing, child care and transportation in Colorado are key drivers of a statewide <a href=\"https://choosecolorado.com/living/cost-of-living/\">cost of living that is 12% above</a> the national average.</p>\n\n<p>For many Coloradans, a few hundred extra dollars a month would go a long way. Yet today, the U.S. safety net appears more tenuous than ever and is unlikely to meet all their needs.</p>\n\n<p>Nationally, over the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5581505/government-shutdown-federal-employees-paycheck\">1.4 million federal workers</a> went without paychecks. More than <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/\">150,000 jobs</a> were cut in the U.S. private sector in October alone.</p>\n\n<p>As layoffs increase, <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/chicago-fed-labor-market-indicators/latest-release\">fewer people are being hired</a> into new positions. At the same time, the federal government shutdown put <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/us/politics/snap-payments-timeline.html\">families receiving federal food assistance</a> on an emotional roller coaster as aid was promised and then pulled away.</p>\n\n<p>This recent federal funding uncertainty has resurfaced the idea of state or local programs that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/universal-basic-income-ubi-26213\">give people money</a> without any strings attached.</p>\n\n<h2>Rise of guaranteed income programs</h2>\n\n<p>First <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Politics_of_a_Guaranteed_Income/vHIsS0yCYTgC?hl=en\">proposed nationally during the Nixon administration</a> in the 1970s, guaranteed income programs have grown more popular in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The concept got a big boost when entrepreneur <a href=\"https://2020.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/\">Andrew Yang proposed a $1,000 monthly stipend</a> during his bid for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Yang’s proposal called for giving all Americans money to help them deal with economic problems brought on by job losses tied to automation and new technologies.</p>\n\n<p>In Colorado, both <a href=\"https://bouldercolorado.gov/projects/guaranteed-income-pilot-project\">Boulder</a> and <a href=\"https://www.denverbasicincomeproject.org/\">Denver</a> have piloted guaranteed income programs. In both cases the programs were studied using rigorous <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.013\">randomized-control trial</a> research designs. </p>\n\n<p>We are an academic research team comprised of a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mQwxFKAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">social scientist</a> with a background in economic analysis, a <a href=\"https://www.du.edu/node/65031\">social work scholar</a> who studies policy approaches to reducing health and wealth disparities, and an <a href=\"https://korbel.du.edu/directory/stefan-chavez-norgaard/\">urban planning scholar</a> with expertise in state and local policy. </p>\n\n<p>We were contracted to provide <a href=\"https://korbel.du.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Scrivner_Colorado_Cash_Dividend_White_Paper_December_2025.pdf\">an independent evaluation and cost assessment</a> of administering a statewide cash assistance program for Coloradans. Our estimates include projections for population changes, such as the aging workforce, and three tiers of support: from low, $25 per month, to medium, $100 per month, to high, $500 per month.</p>\n\n<p>Rolling out a state government program that gives everyone money would be expensive, so we also estimated what it would cost to introduce a program just for the lowest-income Coloradans. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>What are guaranteed income programs?</h2>\n\n<p>Guaranteed income programs are policies that support a population by giving people money on a regular basis — regardless of their income. They’re called <a href=\"https://basicincome.stanford.edu/about/what-is-ubi/\">universal basic income</a> programs.</p>\n\n<p>More common in practice are <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/berry_c_2023._the_case_for_a_universal_basic_dividend.pdf\">cash dividends</a>. Dividends offer cash assistance to a qualifying group or segment of the population, such as people below a certain income or with a qualifying disability. An example of this is Michigan’s <a href=\"https://rxkids.org/\">Rx Kids Program</a>, which provides cash assistance for pregnant people, new parents and babies.</p>\n\n<p>Guaranteed income programs can be administered at the neighborhood, city or state level. Programs in <a href=\"https://www.cambridgema.gov/riseup\">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/52924/05052020-R3F-Joint-Press-Release?bidId=\">Richmond, California;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bmorechildren.com/guaranteed-income\">Baltimore</a> have all shown efficacy in targeting the needs of local communities. </p>\n\n<p>For example, people who were enrolled in the Rise Up Cambridge program became more likely to be employed, get enough to eat and have housing – while making more money — than those who didn’t get cash assistance. </p>\n\n<p>Most <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2023-0030\">cash assistance programs have succeeded</a>. Research by <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/\">GiveDirectly</a> and the <a href=\"https://basicincome.stanford.edu/uploads/Umbrella%20Review%20BI_final.pdf\">Stanford Basic Income Project</a> likewise find that beneficiaries of cash assistance programs are more likely to get involved in their local communities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2jaDOFnHyI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">An ‘NBC News’ segment looks at a study of a universal basic income program. The study found that most people would spend the money on essentials like food and rent.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These programs can support people who have lost their jobs or are experiencing health crises. In Colorado, a statewide guaranteed income program could help low-income Coloradans <a href=\"https://bellpolicy.org/colorado-housing-primer-2025/\">facing high housing</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.dol.gov/2024/11/19/new-data-childcare-costs-remain-an-almost-prohibitive-expense?webview=trb-wv-ios-v10.0.36&amp;mvtoken=119595010348800\">child care</a> costs. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the program could <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/04/08/colorado-aging-population/\">help Colorado’s growing population of older people</a> with fixed incomes.</p>\n\n<p>It could also address fears that the rise of artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/orientation/2024/03/06/how-ai-shaping-work-world\">will cause job losses and result in lower wages</a> for many workers. <a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/research-brief/research-brief/ai-industrial-revolution\">Columbia Business School researchers have predicted</a> a 5% decline in how much of the country’s total economic output goes to workers’ wages due to artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<h2>Program, not panacea</h2>\n\n<p>While guaranteed income programs can help the people who get money from them, they are complicated, expensive and hard to administer.</p>\n\n<p>Administering a guaranteed income program requires massive capacity to deploy and manage. The state would have to facilitate enrollment, keep mailing addresses or bank information updated and supervise transfers for more than 5 million Coloradans every single month. Some of this data may already exist at state agencies, but no one agency has all of this information at its disposal. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, only <a href=\"https://cdor.colorado.gov/sites/revenue/files/documents/2024_Annual_Report_DR4000.pdf\">80% of adults</a>, roughly 3.3 million people, in Colorado filed a tax return in 2023; only <a href=\"https://famli.colorado.gov/resources/famli-by-the-numbers\">175,000 workers</a> filed a Family and Medical Leave Insurance claim in 2024; and just <a href=\"https://hcpf.colorado.gov/2023-report-to-community\">about 1 million adults</a> are enrolled in Health First Colorado, the state’s Medicaid program.

That’s more than <a href=\"https://content.leg.colorado.gov/explorebudget/\">half of Colorado’s annual general fund</a>. However, it would cost half as much — $3.3. billion — to provide $500 per month to the 554,000 Coloradans who are <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">below the federal poverty line</a>, which is $32,150 for a family of five.</p>\n\n<p>Finding this money within the state budget could require cutting spending elsewhere — potentially from other state-funded programs that benefit low-income families.</p>\n\n<h2>Trade-offs for policymakers</h2>\n\n<p>If federal food assistance, including the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-20849\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>, is disrupted again, either by more funding freezes or <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/snap-cuts-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-will-significantly-impair-recession-response\">new changes in eligibility rules</a>, a statewide supportive assistance program could help offset the impact.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, the average American getting SNAP benefits <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Alabama\">received $6.11 per day</a>, or less than $200 a month. <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/snap_factsheet_colorado.pdf\">One in 10 Coloradans</a>, 584,500 people, receive SNAP benefits.</p>\n\n<p>However, a guaranteed income program might risk pushing some households’ income above the eligibility cutoff for programs like SNAP — creating unintended consequences that harm household welfare.

Over several hours at a nearby settlement, the 18-year-old Palestinian is alleged to have endured <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/12/8/video-palestinian-teen-says-he-was-tortured-in-settler-kidnapping\">repeated beatings, humiliation and harassment</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel military soldiers were reportedly involved in the incident, before they eventually released him the next morning. Hamman was hospitalized with multiple injuries and severe psychological trauma. </p>\n\n<p>The alleged attack is far from isolated. The post-Oct. 7, 2023, environment has seen an <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2025-11-09/ty-article/idf-chief-needs-to-do-more-to-protect-west-bank-palestinians/0000019a-6a38-d218-a5be-7aff9be00000\">escalation in settler violence</a>, which has gone from primarily involving vandalism and property destruction to now being marked by kidnapping, prolonged abuse and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3RE0PA2XPM\">apparent military complicity</a>. In the two years to October 2025, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ohchr-press-release-27oct25/\">more than 3,200 Palestinians</a> were “forcibly displaced by settler violence and movement restrictions,” according to United Nations figures. </p>\n\n<p>Violence has increased to an extent that the U.N. said October 2025 was <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251117-netanyahu-condemns-settler-violence-by-extremists-after-west-bank-clashes\">the worst month for West Bank settler violence</a> since it started recording incidents in 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a scholar who has studied <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBQYKHwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Israeli extremist groups for over two decades</a>, I contend that the dramatic escalation of settler violence in the West Bank reveals a profound <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/magazine/israel-west-bank-settler-violence-impunity.html\">transformation within Israel’s state institutions</a>. Rather than serving as purported neutral enforcers of law and order, the military, Israeli police and the broader governmental apparatus have become increasingly aligned with — and at times directly complicit in — violent settler actions against Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>This institutional reluctance to address settler violence is not merely a failure of enforcement, I would argue, but a deliberate outcome of deep social, political and cultural changes that have reshaped Israeli society since at least the mid-1990s.</p>\n\n<h2>Settlers’ dream government</h2>\n\n<p>The most visible manifestation of this transformation is the <a href=\"https://imeu.org/resources/resources/fact-sheet-meet-israels-new-government-december-2022/165\">composition of Israel’s current government</a>, formed in December 2022. </p>\n\n<p>For the first time, key ministerial positions are held by individuals with explicit <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/itamar-ben-gvir-and-bezalel-smotrich-the-netanyahu-government-extremists-sanctioned-by-the-uk-258644\">pro-settler ideologies and personal ties</a> to some of the most violent streams of the settlement movement. Hence, it is not surprising that prominent figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/who-are-bezalel-smotrich-and-itamar-ben-gvir-the-israeli-ministers-facing-sanctions\">Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir</a> — both settlers with what has been described as extremist ideologies — have actively implemented policies that facilitate and legitimize settler violence. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, Ben-Gvir has significantly eased firearm regulations, issuing over 100,000 new gun licenses since October 2023, with <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/far-right-minister-expands-gun-licensing-granting-access-to-100-000-more-israelis/3675119\">settlers receiving preferential access</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Smotrich, meanwhile, has publicly distributed security equipment to illegal outposts and <a href=\"https://peacenow.org.il/en/budgets-to-68-illegal-outposts\">allocated substantial budgets for settler militias</a>. This political backing fosters a climate in which settlers feel emboldened to act with impunity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Men in suits gesticulate with their hands.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708215/original/file-20251211-62-3tnrmz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Itamar Ben-Gvir, left, and Bezalel Smotrich, center, talk to reporters as they visit the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem on May 10, 2021.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/israeli-knesset-member-and-head-of-the-far-right-jewish-news-photo/1232806949?adppopup=true\">Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond individual ministers, the Israeli government has pursued structural reforms that systematically undermine institutional checks on settler violence.</p>\n\n<p>The transfer of the main Israeli governing body in the West Bank — the Civil Administration authority — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/20/idf-transfers-powers-in-occupied-west-bank-to-pro-settler-civil-servants\">from military central command to Smotrich’s Finance Ministry</a> represents a fundamental shift in governance. For decades, the Civil Administration coordinated the provision of West Bank services such as health and education. It also served as an instrument for coordinating with the Palestinian Authority, the body entrusted per <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/30-years-after-arafat-rabin-handshake-clear-flaws-in-oslo-accords-doomed-peace-talks-to-failure-211362\">the Oslo Accords</a> with limited self-rule over parts of the occupied West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>By placing the Civil Administration under political control rather than independent military command, the government has weakened one of the few mechanisms capable of restraining settler expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, plans to subordinate the <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-denies-folding-border-police-into-national-guard-would-create-private-army/\">West Bank Border Police to Ben-Gvir’s Ministry of National Security</a> threaten to dismantle the unified command structure that has been instrumental in managing tensions in the occupied West Bank since 1967.</p>\n\n<h2>Capitulation to settlers</h2>\n\n<p>Concurrent to these developments has been a blurring of lines between civilian settlers and uniformed security personnel. After Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli authorities distributed 8,000 army rifles to so-called <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/israeli-settlements-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory-including-east-jerusalem-and-in-the-occupied-syrian-golan/\">civilian settlement defense squads and regional defense battalions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These armed settler groups now operate alongside — and are increasingly indistinguishable from — official security forces. Settlers frequently <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/report/civilians-or-soldiers-settler-violence-west-bank\">wear official uniforms and carry army-issued weapons</a> during attacks on Palestinians. </p>\n\n<p>Security infrastructure such as police stations is often physically located within settlements, fostering <a href=\"https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/expert-opinion-on-the-legal-responsibility-of-the-occupying-power/\">close relationships between law enforcement and settler communities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that this geographic and institutional proximity makes neutral policing nearly impossible.</p>\n\n<p>The cultural and social dimensions of this phenomenon run even deeper. Many settlers serve as army reservists, creating overlapping identities between civilian and military personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Civilian security coordinators, who are responsible for coordination between the military and the settlements’ own “defense squads,” actively shape military operational policy. They help define settlement boundaries, determine areas prohibited to Palestinians and <a href=\"https://www.yesh-din.org/en/the-lawless-zone-the-transfer-of-policing-and-security-to-the-civilian-security-coordinators-in-the-settlements-and-outposts/\">occasionally command soldiers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Soldiers typically interpret clashes as friction between civilians rather than crimes requiring intervention. When violence intensifies, they often declare an “emergency situation” and defend settlers rather than protecting Palestinian victims.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"0vbEw\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0vbEw/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Societal shifts</h2>\n\n<p>The transformation of Israeli institutions reflects broader societal changes where the settler movement has evolved from one of many societal factions <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-israeli-settlers-movement-shaped-modern-israel-237813\">to a dominant political force</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Settlers hold key positions in government and military leadership and exercise considerable political influence. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, settler violence has become increasingly embedded in the operational logic of state institutions, turning law enforcement bodies from ostensibly neutral arbiters into what international observers increasingly describe as <a href=\"https://impactpolicies.org/news/660/state-backed-settler-violence-a-strategy-to-displace-palestinians-systematically\">enablers or participants in systematic violence against Palestinians</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It represents, I would argue, a fundamental reorientation of state power in explicit service of settler expansionism.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the failure to hold perpetrators of settler violence to account reveals the extent of the institutional capture. Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of police investigations into settler violence <a href=\"https://www.yesh-din.org/en/data-sheet-december-2023-law-enforcement-on-israeli-civilians-in-the-west-bank-settler-violence-2005-2023/\">were closed without indictment</a> – and only 3% resulted in convictions.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, the last year for which I was able to obtain data, Israeli authorities opened just 87 investigations for “ideologically motivated offenses,” while U.N. monitors documented 585 incidents. </p>\n\n<p>The Israeli police chief in the West Bank has gone so far as to claim that reports of settler violence are <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-03-13/ty-article/.premium/west-bank-police-chief-most-complaints-of-settler-violence-are-false-filed-by-anarchists/0000018e-34cf-d5ad-addf-7cdff2310000\">fabricated by “radical left-wing anarchists</a>.”</p>\n\n<h2>The erosion of judicial scrutiny</h2>\n\n<p>The Israeli Supreme Court has formally acknowledged that the West Bank constitutes <a href=\"https://versa.cardozo.yu.edu/opinions/beit-sourik-village-council-v-government-israel\">occupied territory under international law</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the judicial architecture historically accommodates settlement expansion. Settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law, including the ability to vote in Israeli elections while Palestinians face military law, producing <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/07/israel-un-experts-condemn-decades-unfair-trials-palestinians-occupied-west\">vastly asymmetrical outcomes in cases involving violence and property rights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The country’s Supreme Court, while occasionally striking down discriminatory measures against Palestinians, has bowed to security rationales that permit the broader settlement enterprise to proceed. For example, in 2022, the court rejected a petition to return Palestinian land in the city of Hebron, ruling that an \nIsraeli presence is <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-03-02/ty-article/.premium/top-court-rules-against-returning-palestinian-land-in-hebron-over-security-concerns/0000017f-db27-d3a5-af7f-fbaf9a0a0000\">part of the military’s “regional security doctrine.”</a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three soldiers stand in front of a mechanical digger\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708213/original/file-20251211-56-f1yyhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Israeli soldiers stand by as Israeli construction vehicles destroy agricultural lands and uproot centuries-old olive trees in the village of Karyut, West Bank, on Dec. 8, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/israeli-soldiers-stand-by-as-israeli-construction-vehicles-news-photo/2250129693?adppopup=true\">Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Similarly, in many petitions against military policy of house demolitions, the Supreme Court has adopted a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/when-does-a-court-systematically-deviate-from-its-own-principles-the-adjudication-by-the-israel-supreme-court-of-house-demolitions-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territories/4581C61CEE183DC4D9868064CA7C187F\">deferential stance toward security authorities</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Impact on the peace process</h2>\n\n<p>The implications of this institutional capitulation to settlers’ interests extend far beyond the West Bank itself. Settlers have explicitly viewed the war in the Gaza Strip as an opportunity to accelerate their agenda, <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-343-west-bank\">forcing over 1,000 Palestinians from at least 18 communities since Oct. 7, 2023</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to the humanitarian concerns, this pattern of violence-driven displacement undermines the viability of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-two-state-solution-to-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-221872\">two-state solution</a>, which has returned to international discourse as the centerpiece of “day after” planning for Gaza. It also undermines any claim Israel might make that in lieu of a two-state solution, it can enforce the rule of law equally across people living in territories under its control.  </p>\n\n<p>So while international actors focus on ceasefire negotiations and reconstruction, the violence in the West Bank undermines the territorial and demographic foundations necessary for Palestinian statehood and makes the prospect of a lasting ceasefire more distant. The implications of that for a just future are indeed dire.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269162/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Arie Perliger does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The Conversation U.S. turned to Rice University’s <a href=\"https://profiles.rice.edu/staff/francisco-j-monaldi\">Francisco J. Monaldi</a>, an expert on Latin American energy policy, for answers.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What do we know about the tanker that was seized?</h2>\n\n<p>The seized tanker, which according to reports is a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-we-know-oil-tanker-the-skipper-seized-us-near-venezuela/\">20-year-old vessel called the Skipper</a>, is a supertanker that can <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/\">carry around 2 million barrels</a> of oil.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Trump administration, the vessel was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/us-seizes-venezuelan-oil-tanker-00685289\">heading to Cuba</a>. But because of the size of the ship, I strongly suspect that the final destination was likely China – tankers the size of the seized one don’t tend to be used to take oil across the Caribbean to Cuba. The ones used for that task are far smaller.</p>\n\n<p>This particular tanker was <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/tanker-seized-us-venezuela-iranian-shadow-fleet/33620478.html\">sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022</a> due to it carrying prohibited Iranian oil. At the time, it was claimed that the ship – then called Adisa – was <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1076\">controlled by Russian oil magnate Viktor Artemov</a> and was engaged in an oil smuggling network.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSDiz0NKd34?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p><em>Attorney General Pam Bondi released a video of the seizure on X.</em></p>\n\n<p>So the latest U.S. seizure was, on the surface, unrelated to the sanctions placed on Venezuela by U.S. authorities <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/venezuela-related-sanctions\">in 2019 and expanded in 2020</a> to include secondary sanctions – that is, on countries that do business on the targeted nation or company.</p>\n\n<p>As such, Venezuelan officials have <a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/venezuela-decries-act-international-piracy-us-seizes-oil-tanker-off-countrys-coast-592468\">said this is unprecedented</a>. And they are largely right. While there have been a few occasions in which Iranian tankers have been seized due to sanctions busting, this is the first time that there has been a seizure of a vessel departing Venezuela and with a Venezuelan crew.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has signaled that it is not only seizing the cargo <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/g-s1-101668/seized-oil-tanker-off-the-coast-venezuela\">but the ship itself</a> – which would represent a significant loss for the company owning the ship. The loss will be borne by the company, not Venezuela, as it was under a “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fob.asp\">Free on Board</a>” contract, meaning that as soon as it left Venezuela the buyer takes responsibility for it.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, this is a significant escalation of the pressure campaign on Venezuela, which looks set to continue. Reuters has reported that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/over-30-sanctioned-ships-venezuela-risk-after-us-tanker-seizure-2025-12-11/\">around 30 other tankers near Venezuela</a> have some kind of sanction against them. They form part of a large shadow fleet that try to skirt sanctions through hiding their identity while transporting oil from Russia, Venezuela and Iran.</p>\n\n<p>The signal from U.S. officials is that they are prepared to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-sanctions-maduros-nephews-six-ships-carrying-venezuela-oil-says-axios-2025-12-11/\">go after more vessels</a> and further squeeze Venezuela’s oil revenues through fresh sanctions. </p>\n\n<p>How often they will seize vessels is not known, but the clear threat from the White House is that the U.S. will continue with this seizure campaign. </p>\n\n<h2>How important are oil exports to Venezuela?</h2>\n\n<p>Venezuela’s economy is tremendously dependent on oil production.</p>\n\n<p>We do not have exact figures, as the Venezuela government has not published them in seven years, but most analysts believe oil constitutes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/world/americas/oil-tanker-venezuela-economy-chevron.html\">north of 80% of all of the country’s exports</a> – some even put this figure above 90%.</p>\n\n<p>Most of that oil goes to the black market, and a majority ends up with <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">independent refiners in China</a>. State-owned enterprises in China tend not to buy this oil because they do not want to fall foul of the sanctions regime. But Beijing tends to turn a blind eye to tankers heading to non-state entities, especially if those tankers have hidden their true identity so it doesn’t look like they are coming from Venezuela.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Oil rigs are seen on a large body of water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/708294/original/file-20251212-64-uf6w1s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Oil production makes up a large chunk of Venezuela’s economy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/oil-rigs-are-pictured-in-lake-maracaibo-zulia-state-news-photo/2162227244?adppopup=true\">Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-oil-exports-fall-over-lower-inventories-imports-2025-11-03/\">80% of Venezuelan oil goes to China</a> in this way; around 17% goes to the U.S. through a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-resumes-imports-venezuelan-oil-under-new-license-chevron-2025-08-21/\">license awarded by the U.S. Treasury to oil giant Chevron</a>. And 3% goes to Cuba, which tends to be subsidized by the Venezuelan government.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela’s economy itself is also <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12182-018-0215-4#:%7E:text=With%20no%20alternative%20programs%20for,the%20state%20level%20is%20needed.\">very dependent on oil</a>, with the sector making up about 20% of total GDP, more than any other industry. And when it comes to government income, the oil sector makes up north of 50%.</p>\n\n<h2>How has Venezuela’s oil sector been impacted?</h2>\n\n<p>It is important to know that even before U.S. sanctions began in 2019, Venezuela’s oil production was in severe decline.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998, before Hugo Chávez, the leftist military officer who became a populist president, came to power, oil production <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/collapse-venezuelan-oil-industry-role-above-ground-risks-limiting-fdi\">peaked at around 3.4 million barrels a day</a>. By the time Chávez died and Maduro succeeded him in 2013, it had fallen to 2.7 million barrels a day.</p>\n\n<p>When U.S. sanctions targeting the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, were enacted in 2019, production was down to 1.3 million barrels a day – but that had already been affected by the other financial sanctions that came in two years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>The oil sanctions of 2019 closed the U.S. market, taking away half a million barrels a day that at the time headed from Venezuela to the U.S. As a result, Venezuela had to increase oil sales to India and China.</p>\n\n<p>But then the 2020 secondary sanctions, which apply to countries doing business with Venezuela, came in. As a result, Europe and India stopped buying Venezuelan oil, meaning that its only markets were Cuba and China. Of course, that year also saw the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a massive cooling of the oil market globally.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuelan oil production <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/theres-a-more-effective-way-forward-than-maximum-pressure-for-venezuela/\">collapsed to 400,000 barrels a day</a> that year. Today it has recovered to around 1 million barrels a day. This has been helped by the U.S. allowing Chevron – which, after Petróleos de Venezuela, is the second-largest oil company operating in the country – to continue production.</p>\n\n<h2>How does Venezuela get around oil sanctions?</h2>\n\n<p>Venezuela relies on a shadow fleet to help it skirt U.S. sanctions. These vessels hide their identity by <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/flags-of-inconvenience-113-vessels-flying-a-false-flag-transported-eur-4-7-bn-russian-oil-in-first-three-quarters-of-2025/\">using false flags and false names</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Companies often take a tanker that is going to be retired and change the identity, put on a new coat of paint and make sure transponders – devices that transmit radio signals to give a map reading – are doctored so that it looks like the ship is in a different place altogether.</p>\n\n<p>These ships arrive in Venezuela, pick up oil and then set sail. Sometimes they then transfer the cargo to another ship – which carries huge environmental risks.

That could change, depending on how aggressive the U.S. gets.

Venezuelan oil is already <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuela-forced-double-discount-oil-asia-due-flood-sanctioned-crude-2025-12-10\">sold at a discount</a> on the black market because of the existing risk relating to the sanctions. This latest action is likely to widen these discounts even further. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Venezuela has until now required companies to pay some of the payment for oil cargo upfront – and a lot will be unwilling to do so now, due to high costs involved in a U.S. seizure. For example, a tanker of 2 million barrels, even with the current discount, will be worth around US$100 millon – no one wants to risk that much money. So very few buyers will be willing to prepay. Instead they will expect Venezuela to share the risk.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line for Maduro is that the only way to get someone to buy Venezuelan oil amid the heightened risk of this moment is to offer higher discounts with fewer prepayments. Besides discounts, export volumes could also be affected and that in turn would lead to production cuts, which are costly to reverse.</p>\n\n<p>And all this will further choke off the already limited revenue that Maduro is relying on to keep Venezuela’s government functioning.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271896/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Francisco J.

What is the significance of that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the court’s <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/emergency/emergency-docket-2024/\">emergency docket</a>. If the court takes these cases, they order a <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/emergency/emergency-docket-2025/\">very abbreviated briefing and they decide the matter very quickly</a>. Typically, this is a problem for lower court judges, as the cases are decided with very little explanation. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes months and months intervene before the court gets back to that case and renders a full and complete determination. One example would be the birthright citizenship case that came up to the court on the shadow docket. The court <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/06/supreme-court-sides-with-trump-administration-on-nationwide-injunctions-in-birthright-citizenship-case/\">rendered an interim decision</a> about whether U.S. District Court judges could issue orders stopping nationwide enforcement of Trump policies. They didn’t rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, there have been <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/119104/taking-stock-birthright-citizenship-cases-part-ii/\">conflicting decisions across the country</a>. You have circuits that have ruled on the question and other circuits that haven’t ruled on it at all. So depending on where you live in the United States, you may or may not be subject to what heretofore has been <a href=\"https://lettersandsciencemag.ucdavis.edu/self-society/brief-history-citizenship-14th-amendment-us-constitution\">the accepted interpretation</a> of the 14th Amendment. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>This administration’s clear strategy – to flood the zone by simply <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/\">challenging every adverse decision</a> against it in the lower courts – means there are an unprecedented number of cases <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/emergency/emergency-docket-2025/\">coming up to the Supreme Court</a>. It just means that there’s utter confusion in the lower courts, and it’s been the subject of a lot of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/supreme-court-emergency-rulings-judges-00558058\">dissatisfaction among lower court judges</a>. It really puts the federal court system into a state of uncertainty and chaos, and obviously it’s not good for the public. </p>\n\n<p><strong>U.S. attorneys are <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541\">nominated by the president and confirmed</a> by the Senate. Congress limits how long <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/constitutional-checks-interim-us-attorneys-central-comey-james/story?id=127499571\">interim U.S. attorneys can serve</a> in these positions. But the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2025/10/27/trump-administration-challenged-on-us-attorney-moves/\">circumvented those limits</a>, keeping a number of interim U.S. attorneys on the job past the 120-day limit. These cases have been challenged in court. Why is this conflict notable?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What the president has attempted to do flies in the face of legislation that says that these <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11345\">interim appointments are limited to 120</a> days. Every court has found that the president’s appointment or attempted appointment beyond the first 120 days is <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-appeals-court-us-attorney-trump/\">unlawful and unconstitutional</a>. It is a limitation on the president’s power. </p>\n\n<p>If the president’s version were correct, you could just have endless interim appointments without any involvement by the Senate. This is a place where the courts have, in effect, upheld the integrity of the advice-and-consent system and the constitutional role of the Senate. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Trump ordered the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.ibanet.org/US-presidency-weaponised-Department-of-Justice-investigations-prompt-concerns-over-independence\">to prosecute James Comey and Letitia James</a>, among others. He has also granted massive numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/trump-pardons-arrests\">pardons and commutations</a>. What are your thoughts on these?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My takeaway as an American citizen and as a former judge is that at bottom, President Trump simply lacks respect for our system of justice. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t think you can find otherwise when on your first day in office you issue over <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-36809/trump-pardons-january-6-riot\">1,000 pardons for people</a> who were justifiably convicted or pled guilty to what was, by any account, an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. He has pardoned countless people since then, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/americas/trump-pardon-honduras-hernandez.html\">a former president of Honduras</a> who his own administration prosecuted and for which there was abundant evidence that he was a drug trafficker. He’s blowing up boats in the Caribbean without, in my view, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/22/drug-boats-strikes-cia-legal-concerns/\">any rationale that’s grounded in law</a>. The president believes the law is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/us/politics/trump-saves-country-quote.html\">whatever he says it is</a> at any given moment. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a white pantsuit walks next to a man in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=554&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=554&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707930/original/file-20251210-56-mzfclx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=554&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, seen here in March 2025, appear to work in lockstep, where the president’s wishes set the Justice Department’s agenda.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-walks-with-u-s-attorney-general-pam-news-photo/2205124276?adppopup=true\">Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As to the Department of Justice, I think that’s one of the most worrisome things about this administration. There is a seamless interface between the White House and the Department of Justice that is problematic, and it is quite clear that the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.ibanet.org/US-presidency-weaponised-Department-of-Justice-investigations-prompt-concerns-over-independence\">will do anything that the president wants</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>I think we’re in a very, very difficult and dark place when the president by fiat can simply order his attorney general to prosecute a person. And I think every American should worry about a world where that takes place without any buffer. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The administration has a documented pattern of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/judges-trump-court-rulings\">disobeying or sidestepping court orders</a>. Your thoughts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The way our system is supposed to work is that people can disagree with lower court decisions, but they have to obey them, unless they’re stayed by application to a higher court. The administration seems to have decided that they’re going to write U.S. district judges out of the picture and simply disregard their orders. </p>\n\n<p>When I served as a U.S. District Court judge, I always understood that I had pretty awesome power to do things. That power was to be used sparingly and carefully, but when I ordered something, I expected that that order would be followed. </p>\n\n<p>That is the nature of the rule of law and our system of justice that now has been turned on its head by this administration. </p>\n\n<p>The second point is that I would wish that our Supreme Court\nwould take a stronger stand against this kind of gamesmanship in the lower courts. Those who serve in the third branch – the nation’s courts – are all in this together. There has to be more attention given to an administration that has really gone rogue in terms of how they treat the orders of U.S. District Court judges. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I don’t think <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/28/judges-trump-administration-rule-of-law/\">the public has ever heard more from judges</a> or former judges or retired judges than they are hearing right now. That includes you, president of a university, former federal judge, saying things that I think the public isn’t accustomed to hearing from either current or former judges. What’s going on?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What’s happening is that judges who come from all stripes, philosophically and party affiliations, are deeply concerned and offended about the tenor of the times, and they feel the need, as I do, to become active and to <a href=\"https://keepourrepublic.org/what-we-do/initiatives/article-iii-coalition/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22690622780&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA__XblC5--KpU6qDaM0YjtYFbnDBV&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA0eTJBhBaEiwA-Pa-hQfCDkZ9MEvD_kwJFNkAVmT7lGDxlDM3hcAvoOJs-DOtKsFCsu5ZNhoCCocQAvD_BwE\">rally to the support</a> of our system of justice.

New DNA mutations arise and get passed from parents to offspring. If any genetic changes prove to be beneficial, they might give those young a survival edge.</p>\n\n<p>Over the great span of time – through the slow closing of a land bridge here or the rise of a mountain range there – species eventually split. They go on evolving slowly along their own trajectories with their own unique mutations. That’s the process that over the past 3.5 billion years has created the millions of branches on the evolutionary tree of life.</p>\n\n<p>However, new genome sequencing data reveals an unexpected twist to this long evolutionary story. It turns out that the boundaries between species on their own branches of this tree are a little more permeable than previously thought. Rather than waiting around for new mutations to solve a particular problem, interbreeding between different species can introduce ready-made genetic advantages.</p>\n\n<h2>Unraveling the story of life, one genome at a time</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man holds a small grey bird with red on its face up with one hand\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707168/original/file-20251208-76-xgkoqn.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The author with a red-faced warbler (<em>Cardellina rubrifrons</em>), one of the wood warbler species included in the study.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Kevin Bennett</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=YO4WypkAAAAJ\">As an evolutionary biologist</a>, I’ve been studying the stories written in the genomes of animals for over two decades. I focus mostly on colorful songbirds called wood warblers that hail from North, Central and South America. There are approximately 115 species in total, and they come in a dazzling array of bright colors.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these birds might be familiar to you, such as the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/art/birds-america/blackburnian-warbler\">Blackburnian warbler</a> (<em>Setophaga fusca</em>), which lights up the tops of the pine trees in the eastern forests of the U.S. and Canada during spring and summer. Other warbler species might be less familiar, like the <a href=\"https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/pihwar1/\">pink-headed warbler</a> (<em>Cardellina versicolor</em>), which lives only in the highlands of Guatemala and southern Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>The story of these New World warblers was written within the past 10 million years or so – relatively recently in evolutionary terms. They’re all, in effect, “evolutionary neighbors,” sitting next to each other at the tips of the crown of the tree of life. In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003501\">my team’s most recent work</a>, led by evolutionary biologist <a href=\"https://www.kevinfpbennett.com/\">Kevin Bennett</a>, we gathered a massive amount of data from warbler genomes – over 2 trillion base pairs, from nearly every species of warbler – to learn more about their evolutionary history.</p>\n\n<p>We found that some species have unexpectedly leaped over evolutionary hurdles by sharing solutions to evolutionary problems. We are now learning from this kind of data that species aren’t just vertical, evolutionary silos, as we once thought. Instead, there is much more horizontal “cross talk” among the branches of the evolutionary tree.</p>\n\n<p>These warblers now join <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11041\">Amazonian butterflies</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01438.x\">cichlid fish in Africa</a>, as well as our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13408\">own hominid lineage</a>, as exemplars of this process of evolutionary sharing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a nest filled with baby birds, one faces up with its mouth open\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707419/original/file-20251209-56-f6rm3h.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nestlings in a hybrid zone between golden-winged (<em>Vermivora chrysoptera</em>) and blue-winged warblers (<em>V. cyanoptera</em>).

Famous hybrids include offspring between polar and grizzly bears – affectionately called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/magazine/should-you-fear-the-pizzly-bear.html\">“pizzly” bears</a> – as well as mules, the offspring of horses and donkeys.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike mules, which are sterile and cannot reproduce, in instances of natural warbler hybrids, we think these rare offspring can sometimes “backcross”: They breed with one of the parental species, ultimately moving genes across species boundaries. These hybrids are the genetic conduit by which genes are shared across the branches in the evolutionary tree.</p>\n\n<p>But aren’t we all taught in biology class that species can’t interbreed with other species? Isn’t that what helps define a species?</p>\n\n<p>In reality, biology always has its exceptions and fuzzy edges. And this is one: Species result from the very gradual process of speciation, which typically takes millions of years. The <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy\">taxonomic</a> boxes we humans like to put around “species” don’t typically capture the blurry borders around lineages early in this long process, when otherwise distinct plants and animals can still interbreed.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, my lab has described many <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27070703\">interspecies</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blaa085\">intergenus</a> hybrids in warblers, including at least one <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0557\">arising from both</a>. We’ve also identified “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2011.05360.x\">hybrid zones</a>” between very closely related species, where hybridization is rampant.</p>\n\n<p>And if the genes within these hybrids are beneficial in the recipient species, they’ll spread – just like a new, beneficial mutation passed to an offspring. In this case, it’s not just a single mutation but can be a whole new complement of mutations in multiple genes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"small bright yellow bird sits on a branch\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707422/original/file-20251209-86-qx0x6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Wood warblers need particular genes to help them process and deposit certain pigment molecules in what they eat to make brightly colored feathers, like in this yellow warbler.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/american-yellow-warbler-fredericton-new-brunswick-royalty-free-image/1298749295\">Marc Guitard/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Shared genes solve ‘evolutionary problems’</h2>\n\n<p>Our most recent work in wood warblers shows that the evolutionary solutions they’re sharing are related to their coloration.</p>\n\n<p>In this family of birds, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.06.034\">previously identified</a> genes related to their carotenoid-based coloration. Carotenoid pigments give birds their brilliant orange, yellow and red plumes – colors that are exemplified by the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Yellow_Warbler/\">yellow warbler</a>. But birds, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2017.01.002\">like all vertebrates</a>, can’t synthesize carotenoid pigments on their own. They need to obtain carotenoids from their diet and then chemically process them.</p>\n\n<p>But processing carotenoids appears to be an evolutionary hurdle that not all birds have jumped and a rather difficult problem to solve. Our genome sequencing shows that these warblers have more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.10.094\">shared carotenoid genes</a> than other shared genes in their genome, and it’s likely that different versions of carotenoid-processing genes improve the recipients’ fitness.</p>\n\n<p>One carotenoid-processing gene, called <em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba0803\">beta-carotene oxygenase 2</a></em>, or <em>BCO2</em>, has been shared several times within this single family of birds. Moreover, <em>BCO2</em> appears to be so popular that it shows second-order sharing: passing from one species to another, and then on to a third.</p>\n\n<h2>A sign of quality on the mating circuit</h2>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I think these genes are so popular because male warblers use these carotenoid colors to attract females that have a discerning eye. Male birds obtain carotenoids from the <a href=\"https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/how-birds-make-colorful-feathers/\">insects they eat</a>. The idea is that the more colorful a male is, the higher the quality of its diet.</p>\n\n<p>From across the forest, the males’ rich carotenoid colors are signaling that they’d be good dads with good genes. Biologists call this kind of display an “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/378904\">honest signal</a>.” And if males obtain a new gene that allows them to process carotenoids more efficiently, it’s likely to spread faster and farther into the species, as the brighter males will potentially have greater mating success.</p>\n\n<p>Our research with warblers demonstrates how evolution can shuffle genes across the thin lines between species. These close evolutionary neighbors sometimes share DNA, including potentially beneficial mutations, by mating across the species lines defined by humans’ classification systems. </p>\n\n<p>We suspect that the more we look, the more we’ll find this kind of borrowing among evolutionary neighbors. As we unravel the stories told in the genomes of nature’s problem-solvers, it’s likely we’ll find that their threads are deeply intertwined.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268846/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Toews works for Pennsylvania State University.

An AI-powered digital assistant can misunderstand someone’s speech in embarrassing ways, a chatbot could hallucinate facts, or, as I experienced, an AI-based navigation tool might even guide drivers through a corn field – all without registering the errors. </p>\n\n<p>People tolerate these mistakes because the technology makes certain tasks more efficient. Increasingly, however, proponents are advocating the use of AI – sometimes with limited human supervision – in fields where mistakes have high cost, such as health care. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr238/text\">bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in early 2025</a> would <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01540-2\">allow AI systems to prescribe medications autonomously</a>. Health researchers as well as lawmakers since then <a href=\"https://bhmpc.com/2025/02/could-ai-prescribe-medications-h-r-238/\">have debated</a> whether such prescribing would be feasible or advisable. </p>\n\n<p>How exactly such prescribing would work if this or similar legislation passes remains to be seen. But it raises the stakes for how many errors AI developers can allow their tools to make and what the consequences would be if those tools led to negative outcomes – even patient deaths.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://tendrel.binghamton.edu/\">researcher studying complex systems</a>, I investigate <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fBRKCewAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">how different components of a system interact</a> to produce unpredictable outcomes. Part of my work focuses on exploring the limits of science – and, more specifically, of AI. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past 25 years I have worked on projects including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/7691370\">traffic light coordination</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ijpis.net/ojs/index.php/IJPIS/article/view/51\">improving bureaucracies</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81484-7_6\">tax evasion detection</a>. Even when these systems can be highly effective, they are never perfect. </p>\n\n<p>For AI in particular, errors might be an inescapable <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.17468\">consequence of how the systems work</a>. My lab’s research suggests that particular properties of the data used to train AI models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-025-00565-7\">play a role</a>. This is unlikely to change, regardless of how much time, effort and funding researchers direct at improving AI models. </p>\n\n<h2>Nobody – and nothing, not even AI – is perfect</h2>\n\n<p>As Alan Turing, considered the father of computer science, once said: “If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.” This is because learning is an essential part of intelligence, and people usually learn from mistakes. I see this tug-of-war between intelligence and infallibility at play in my research.</p>\n\n<p>In a study published in July 2025, my colleagues and I showed that perfectly organizing certain datasets into clear categories <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-025-00565-7\">may be impossible</a>. In other words, there may be a minimum amount of errors that a given dataset produces, simply because of the fact that elements of many categories overlap. For some datasets – the core underpinning of many AI systems – AI will not perform better than chance. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A portrait of seven dogs of different breeds.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707914/original/file-20251210-56-45yeqa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Features of different dog breeds may overlap, making it hard for some AI models to differentiate them.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/large-group-of-various-breeds-of-dogs-together-on-a-royalty-free-image/1278389684\">MirasWonderland/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For example, a model trained on a dataset of millions of dogs that logs only their age, weight and height will probably distinguish <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chihuahua/\">Chihuahuas</a> from <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/\">Great Danes</a> with perfect accuracy. But it may make mistakes in telling apart an <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute/\">Alaskan malamute</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher/\">Doberman pinscher</a>, since different individuals of different species might fall within the same age, weight and height ranges. </p>\n\n<p>This categorizing is called classifiability, and my students and I started studying it in 2021. Using data from more than half a million students who attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México between 2008 and 2020, we wanted to solve a seemingly simple problem. Could we use an AI algorithm to predict which students would finish their university degrees on time –  that is, within three, four or five years of starting their studies, depending on the major? </p>\n\n<p>We tested several popular algorithms that are used for classification in AI and also developed our own. No algorithm was perfect; the best ones − <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.61467/2007.1558.2025.v16i1.551\">even one we developed specifically for this task</a> − achieved an accuracy rate of about 80%, meaning that at least 1 in 5 students were misclassified. We realized that many students were identical in terms of grades, age, gender, socioeconomic status and other features – yet some would finish on time, and some would not. Under these circumstances, no algorithm would be able to make perfect predictions.</p>\n\n<p>You might think that more data would improve predictability, but this usually comes with diminishing returns. This means that, for example, for each increase in accuracy of 1%, you might need 100 times the data. Thus, we would never have enough students to significantly improve our model’s performance. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, many unpredictable turns in lives of students and their families – unemployment, death, pregnancy – might occur after their first year at university, likely affecting whether they finish on time. So even with an infinite number of students, our predictions would still give errors.</p>\n\n<h2>The limits of prediction</h2>\n\n<p>To put it more generally, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-32817-6\">what limits prediction is complexity</a>. The word complexity comes from the Latin <em>plexus</em>, which means intertwined. The components that make up a complex system are intertwined, and it’s the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10699-012-9305-8\">interactions between them</a> that determine what happens to them and how they behave. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, studying elements of the system in isolation would probably yield misleading insights about them – as well as about the system as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, a car traveling in a city. Knowing the speed at which it drives, it’s theoretically possible to predict where it will end up at a particular time. But in real traffic, its speed will depend on interactions with other vehicles on the road. Since the details of these interactions emerge in the moment and cannot be known in advance, precisely predicting what happens to the the car is possible only a few minutes into the future.  </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FqsvgFTQv8w?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">AI is already playing an enormous role in health care.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Not with my health</h2>\n\n<p>These same principles apply to prescribing medications. Different conditions and diseases can have the same symptoms, and people with the same condition or disease may exhibit different symptoms. For example, fever can be caused by a respiratory illness or a digestive one. And a cold might cause cough, but not always.</p>\n\n<p>This means that health care datasets have significant overlaps that would prevent AI from being error-free.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, humans also make errors. But when AI misdiagnoses a patient, as it surely will, the situation <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/killer-robots-hit-the-road-and-the-law-has-yet-to-catch-up-49735\">falls into a legal limbo</a>. It’s not clear who or what would be responsible if a patient were hurt. Pharmaceutical companies? Software developers? Insurance agencies? Pharmacies?</p>\n\n<p>In many contexts, neither humans nor machines are the best option for a given task. “Centaurs,” or “hybrid intelligence” – that is, a combination of humans and machines – <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-hybrid-intelligence-is-the-future-of-human-ai-collaboration/\">tend to be better than each on their own</a>. A doctor could certainly use AI to decide potential drugs to use for different patients, depending on their medical history, physiological details and genetic makeup. Researchers are already exploring this approach in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-anecdotes-to-ai-tools-how-doctors-make-medical-decisions-is-evolving-with-technology-244271\">precision medicine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But common sense and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.288.5468.979\">precautionary principle</a><br>\nsuggest that it is too early for AI to prescribe drugs without human oversight. And the fact that mistakes may be baked into the technology could mean that where human health is at stake, human supervision will always be necessary.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251036/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carlos Gershenson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This is not the setup to an elaborate joke. Instead, these are all examples of recent AI-generated political videos. New easy-to-use tools – and acceptance of those tools by politicians – means that these fake videos are quickly becoming commonplace in American politics. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about many of the videos is how clearly fake they are. Rather than trying to deceive the viewer into thinking a depicted event actually happened, the videos serve a different purpose. President Trump didn’t post a video of himself <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/king-pope-jedi-superman-trumps-social-media-images-exclusively-target-his-base-and-try-to-blur-political-reality-259950\">wearing a crown in a fighter jet</a> dumping feces on a group of protesters because he wanted people to believe that the flight actually happened. He likely did it to express his feelings about the protest and to create an in-joke with his followers. </p>\n\n<p>Fears about the political implications of AI-generated videos have been around since the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/deepfake\">term deepfakes</a> was coined in 2017. Steady improvements in the technology mean that distinguishing real from fake could become a significant threat. But today’s use of AI imagery is largely about making memes and making money – in other words, typical social media content. </p>\n\n<h2>Getting a rise out of people</h2>\n\n<p>Internet platforms use algorithms designed to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testified-that-the-companys-algorithms-are-dangerous-heres-how-they-can-manipulate-you-169420\">keep people engaged</a>, and that typically means promoting content that stirs emotions. AI-generated political videos often provoke an emotional response – amusement or outrage.</p>\n\n<p>People are more likely to share information when it is emotionally arousing. For example, people are <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/614352300\">more likely to pass along</a> urban legends that elicit feelings of disgust, and news articles that are emotionally charged are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0353\">more likely to make</a> the New York Times list of most emailed articles. Similar patterns occur online, where emotional content is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620917336\">much more likely to go viral</a> than nonemotional content. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, strong emotions can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3\">interfere with people’s ability to detect false information</a>. People are worse at distinguishing between true and false political news headlines when they are  experiencing stronger emotions – for instance, enthusiasm, excitement or fear. Thus, emotionally appealing AI-generated videos are both more likely to spread and reduce people’s ability to judge whether they are real or fake. </p>\n\n<h2>Online politics</h2>\n\n<p>Creating and sharing AI videos is also a powerful way for people to demonstrate their allegiances and show their political identities. “I am a Trump supporter, so I post AI videos of ICE detainees crying to own the libs” or “I am a Democrat and so I share Governor Newsom’s AI-video of JD Vance talking about couches to show that I’m in on the joke.”  </p>\n\n<p>What’s new in recent months is that campaigns and politicians are using AI-created videos, not just their supporters. An analysis from The New York Times showed that Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/21/business/media/trump-ai-truth-social-no-kings.html\">commonly uses AI imagery</a> to “attack enemies and rouse supporters”. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1984416921937232084&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>These new tools also allow for active participation in the political process. Rather than simply watching politicians and voting, citizens can play an active role in shaping the conversation between elections. </p>\n\n<p>Information and technology researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=C6KSF5gAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Kate Starbird</a> has written about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/misinformation-is-more-than-just-bad-facts-how-and-why-people-spread-rumors-is-key-to-understanding-how-false-information-travels-and-takes-root-241748\">similar dynamics</a> in the ways that everyday Americans found “evidence” for voter fraud in the 2020 election. Politicians told the public that voter fraud was going to occur, and then when voters saw things that they did not understand when voting, such as the use of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/claim-sharpie-pens-ruin-arizona-ballots-f5287df8fdb2be101b2cdf9edd007746\">Sharpie pens to mark ballots</a>, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231177943\">interpreted that action as evidence</a> of voter fraud. Politicians then circulated that evidence online to support the false narrative.</p>\n\n<p>New AI tools make this cycle of participatory disinformation even simpler. Instead of reinterpreting actual events as evidence for a false claim, people can easily generate that evidence themselves. </p>\n\n<h2>AI video at volume</h2>\n\n<p>AI video creation tools make it incredibly easy for people to churn out hundreds of videos, post them online and simply see what content becomes popular and goes viral. In fact, that’s exactly what seems to have happened with recent AI-generated videos of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to an <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-videos-of-ice-raids-are-wildly-viral-on-facebook/\">investigation by 404 media</a>, Facebook user “USA Journey 897” used to post a variety of real videos of police activity as well as absurd AI videos of people carrying whales and riding tigers. </p>\n\n<p>However, after the release of a new version of OpenAI’s Sora video generator on Sept. 30, 2025, the account switched entirely to posting multiple fake videos of deportations every day. Most of the videos accumulated hundreds of thousands of views, and one fake video of a Walmart employee being detained had over 4 million views. </p>\n\n<p>Typically these accounts are hosted overseas and exist to earn money through creator incentive programs. These incentives create an environment where social media no longer informs people about the world, but instead serves as a fun-house mirror, presenting back to us the world that we want to see – or at least the version of the world that will capture our attention and outrage. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aedjprw0GCQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">AI-generated political ads are stretching ethical boundaries.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Flowing into the internet</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not always easy for people to detect which videos are real and which are AI-generated. A recent audit by the publication Indicator found that platforms <a href=\"https://indicator.media/p/tech-platforms-fail-to-label-ai-content-c2pa-metadata\">regularly fail to properly label AI content</a>. Researchers posted over 500 AI-generated images and videos across Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok and YouTube. Less than one-third were properly labeled as AI-generated, and even posts generated by the platform’s own AI tools were often missed. </p>\n\n<p>For years, the great fear concerning political deepfakes was that they were going to fool people into believing something happened that didn’t. They still might, but at the moment, AI-generated political videos are a mix of entertainment and memes, legitimate attempts at persuasion, and ways of capturing attention for money. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, they are now just like the rest of the internet. Most of what we see and share is meant to entertain, some is meant to inform and persuade, and a great deal exists solely to monetize our attention.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268977/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lisa Fazio does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It was the expected entry point for getting a job as a marketing specialist, project manager, IT support analyst, among other roles.</p>\n\n<p>But this expectation is shifting. Many fields – including cybersecurity, health care and advanced manufacturing – are facing <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/skills-shortages/\">significant shortages in skilled workers</a>. The gap between available skilled jobs and workers is likely to push employers to rethink what they require from job candidates over the next decade.</p>\n\n<p>A major demographic shift will also play a role. Between 2024 and 2032, <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/skills-shortages/\">an estimated 18.4 million experienced workers</a> with education beyond high school are expected to retire, according to September 2025 findings by Georgetown University’s center on education and the workforce. </p>\n\n<p>Only 13.8 million younger workers with similar education levels are expected to enter the workforce during the same period, these findings show. This trend will also make it harder for employers to fill roles that traditionally require a college degree. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677c2459dcf44df291d3ed9b/67e748e790b42fe260c27860_%28OATW%29%202024%20Public%20Sector%20Impact%20Report.pdf\">25 states over the past few years</a> have enacted legislation and executive orders to remove college degree requirements for people applying for some public sector jobs, signaling a shift in how essential college degrees <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223668/apprenticeships-are-a-trending-alternative-to-college-but-theres-a-hitch\">are for getting hired</a> for some kinds of work. </p>\n\n<p>These shifts underscore a broader trend: A four-year degree is no longer essential for many kinds of work.</p>\n\n<p>Hiring data tells a similar story. As of January 2024, 52% of U.S. <a href=\"https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/02/27/educational-requirements-job-postings/\">job postings on Indeed</a> did not mention any formal education requirement, up from 48% in 2019.

We think it is also important that prospective college students and their families are aware of educational opportunities besides a traditional four-year degree. </p>\n\n<h2>Understanding polytechnic universities</h2>\n\n<p>Some people think of higher education in terms of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-liberal-arts-a-literature-scholar-explains-211011\">traditional liberal arts</a> colleges or <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/barbaras-blog/what-research-university\">research universities</a>. But there are also polytechnic universities, which focus on hands-on, career-aligned learning and emphasize strong STEM and technical programs. These schools often prepare students for exactly the kinds of jobs employers struggle to fill.</p>\n\n<p>There are about 10 major <a href=\"https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/a-polytechnic-transformation.aspx\">polytechnic universities</a> in the U.S. Some well-known polytechnic universities are California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, and State University of New York Polytechnic Institute in Marcy and Albany, New York. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of offering a wide range of liberal arts majors, polytechnic universities offer majors such as engineering, robotics, construction management and information technology.</p>\n\n<p>A central feature of these schools is <a href=\"https://www.suny.edu/applied-learning/about/definitions/\">applied learning</a> – hands-on labs, real-world projects and problem-solving experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Polytechnic students can earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees, but they also can often get short-term certificates in fields such as human resources, instructional design, project management and digital marketing. Many programs also include apprenticeships, such as workplace <a href=\"https://www.uwstout.edu/academics/certificates-certifications/workforce-development-specialist-certificate/workforce-development-specialist-apprenticeship\">training specialists</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Students can also pursue <a href=\"https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/news/what-is-a-microcredential/\">microcredentials</a>, which involve short course sequences that build targeted skills, such as business writing or engineering mechanics. These options give students more flexible and affordable ways to learn without committing to a traditional four-year degree. </p>\n\n<p>Polytechnic <a href=\"https://floridapoly.edu/admissions/undergraduate-tuition/\">universities also</a> <a href=\"https://www.calpoly.edu/financial-aid/costs-and-affordability/undergraduate-costs-attendance-2024-25\">tend to cost less</a> than <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college\">research universities</a> and private colleges, and students can use federal financial aid or private loans to attend. </p>\n\n<p>There are some limitations. Polytechnic schools generally offer fewer majors, usually within STEM fields. Their alumni networks may be smaller, and we have found that some people perceive them as less prestigious than traditional universities because they focus more on teaching than on research.</p>\n\n<h2>Real world relevance</h2>\n\n<p>In March 2025, <a href=\"https://www.uwstout.edu/about-us/our-polytechnic-advantage/polytechnic-summit/2025-polytechnic-summit-archives\">we asked</a> 10 online instructors at different polytechnic universities how they bring career-focused learning into their classes.</p>\n\n<p>Our research, which will likely be published in 2026, shows that every instructor tried to make their courses feel relevant to real workplaces. </p>\n\n<p>Some instructors used simulations in the course. Others shared examples from their own industry backgrounds with students. All agreed that students learn best when they can clearly connect their coursework to their career goals.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most effective strategies is hiring instructors with deep industry experience. Their professional networks help programs stay aligned with the skills employers currently value.</p>\n\n<p>Not every college wants to become a polytechnic, and not every student wants that style of education. </p>\n\n<p>However, traditional universities can still learn from this model by adding more applied learning, embedding essential job skills into their programs, and partnering more closely with industry. These changes can better prepare students to succeed in the workforce.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268349/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kelly Droege works for the University of Wisconsin - Stout, a polytechnic institution. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Laura Reisinger does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Meanwhile, public universities <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023\">quietly power the nation’s research engine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Ivies do play a critical role in advanced research. But the nation’s public universities make up the backbone of U.S. innovation – research powerhouses such as the University of Michigan, the University of Texas at Austin, Georgia Institute of Technology and Stony Brook University, where I teach.</p>\n\n<p>These places <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/\">train the overwhelming majority</a> of science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates for the U.S. workforce and <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023\">run the lion’s share</a> of federally funded science and engineering research.</p>\n\n<h2>Slashing research and development</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. colleges and universities spend more than US$108.8 billion annually on research and development, of which about 55% – roughly $60 billion – <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25313\">comes from federal funding</a> via agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Together, the country’s eight Ivy League schools received <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023\">approximately $4.6 billion</a> of federal university research and development funding in 2023 – or 7.8% of all federal research and development funding allocated to academia. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, meanwhile, the University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/what-do-universities-do-with-the-billions-they-receive-from-the-government/\">each received over $1 billion in federal research funds</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s federal research and development funding cuts are largely tied to what are called “indirect costs.”</p>\n\n<p>Direct costs fund researcher salaries and lab supplies. Indirect costs support the infrastructure that makes research possible and compliant with federal guidelines: lighting, heating and cooling for labs; high-speed data networks; security; and administrative staff who handle payroll and ensure adherence to federal safety and ethics standards.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15zypvgxz5o\">decided to cap indirect costs</a> for grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation at 15% of the total grant. Traditionally, universities have negotiated their own rates based on documented overhead expenses, with many institutions citing <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33627\">indirect cost rates between 50% and 70%</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Many aspects of the 15% cap have been paused <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/05/nih-indirect-costs-lawsuit-argued-federal-appeals-court/\">as they’re being challenged in court</a>. Should these cuts go through, it would be incredibly disruptive for universities that have counted on this funding. </p>\n\n<p>However, outside of the battle over indirect costs, many research projects simply lost funding or experienced major delays. Over the past year, thousands of grants have been <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nih-nsf-cuts-2025-data?\">frozen, terminated or left unfunded</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ivy League institutions are much better equipped to weather the storm.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/10/31/ballooning-ivy-league-endowment-forecasted-to-top-1-trillion-by-2048/\">Forbes reported that the collective endowment</a> of the eight Ivies was approximately $192.6 billion – led by Harvard’s $53.2 billion and Yale’s $42.3 billion. Supporters of Trump’s funding cuts have argued that this immense, tax-exempt financial arsenal could significantly subsidize their overhead costs, rather than relying on taxpayers to do so. While endowments don’t serve as a blank check, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/endowments-arent-blank-checks-but-universities-can-rely-on-them-more-heavily-in-turbulent-times-254909\">schools can still pull from them in times of need</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, public universities are far more dependent on federal funds to sustain labs, staff and graduate programs. In 2021, the entire Texas public university system – the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&amp;M, the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Dallas and Texas Tech – <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=73\">held an endowment of around $40 billion</a>, more than $10 billion less than Harvard’s.</p>\n\n<h2>Public schools are the training ground</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t to argue that the Ivies should have their research funding cut, while public universities ought to be spared. It’s to shift the focus of the conversation to who stands to lose the most: the public universities that educate <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20223/u-s-institutions-providing-s-e-higher-education#s-e-higher-education-cost-debt-and-financial-aid\">the vast majority of the U.S.’s future scientists</a> and fuel most of the nation’s scientific output.</p>\n\n<p>The Ivy League’s geographic reach is extremely concentrated, situated across just seven states, all in the Northeast. Public four-year institutions are located in all 50 states and <a href=\"https://www.luminafoundation.org/topics/todays-institutions/public-universities/\">draw from a much more economically and racially diverse population</a>. They award the vast majority of engineering degrees in the U.S., <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/cip/engineering?\">with more than 144,701 given out in 2023</a>, or more than 70% of the nation’s total.</p>\n\n<p>Purdue University awarded 3,827 engineering degrees that year, with Texas A&amp;M conferring 3,704. By contrast, Cornell University granted just 820 engineering degrees – the most among the Ivies, but <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/cip/engineering\">just 25th nationally</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Elite schools, including the Ivies, have increasingly <a href=\"https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2023/03/2022-Career-Plan-SEAS-Final.pdf\">steered graduates</a> <a href=\"https://features.thecrimson.com/2024/senior-survey/after-harvard/\">into finance, law or consulting</a>. Just 2.72% of Yale’s 2024 graduating class <a href=\"https://ocs.yale.edu/outcomes/\">was employed as engineers six months after graduation</a>. Meanwhile, public universities serve as <a href=\"https://www.collegetransitions.com/blog/top-universities-for-tech-jobs/\">the top feeder schools for major defense and aerospace firms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stony Brook University’s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences <a href=\"https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/irpe/fact_book/data_and_reports/_files/enrollment/FallbyCollegeSchool.pdf\">enrolled over 5,600 students in fall 2024</a>, making it one of the top producers of engineering talent in New York. The university manages the Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, which uses advanced tools such as particle colliders to make discoveries in physics, energy, materials and biology.

The <a href=\"https://www.carescout.com/cost-of-care\">costs are high</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/a-look-at-nursing-facility-characteristics/\">quality of care is unpredictable</a> at best, often falling short.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. health care system is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-024-00148-2\">so hard to navigate</a> that experts can find it aggravating. Even when people who need help with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/activities-of-daily-living-adls\">activities of daily living</a> – a list that includes getting dressed, preparing meals and bathing – receive the care they need, they may still experience social isolation.

By the late 2070s, older adults could outnumber children under 18 for the first time in human history. </p>\n\n<p>Caring for a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/04/elder-care-home-health-shortage/\">growing number of older people</a> with a shrinking number of younger people is expensive and complicated.

The U.S. <a href=\"https://www.phinational.org/policy-research/key-facts-faq/\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> estimates that nearly <a href=\"https://www.phinational.org/policy-research/key-facts-faq/\">9 million new direct-care workers</a>, such as nursing assistants, home health aides and personal care aides, will be needed in the next decade to care for the people who will need their services.</p>\n\n<p>Yet a 2023 <a href=\"https://www.ahcancal.org/News-and-Communications/Fact-Sheets/FactSheets/SNF%20Survey%20Mid-Year%202023.pdf\">survey by the American Health Care Association</a> found that 77% of nursing homes face staffing shortages, and 95% report difficulty hiring.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large group of older people gathers.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=171&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=171&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=171&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=215&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=215&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707584/original/file-20251210-56-ku5d9t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=215&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The share of people over 65 is growing quickly around the world.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/vector-illustration-material-senior-royalty-free-illustration/1391943014?adppopup=true\">kei_gokei/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Time banking origins</h2>\n\n<p>Time banking emerged in Japan in 1973 through the work of <a href=\"http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue17/miller.htm\">Teruko Mizushima</a>, a housewife who became a social activist. It was later popularized in the United States by <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/edgar-cahns-second-act-time-banking-and-the-return-of-mutual-aid/\">Edgar Cahn</a>, a lawyer who dedicated his life to making society more fair.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is simple: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-c7604a19ff624ffe9770e2c27f17b7ad\">One hour of help equals one time credit</a>, regardless of the task or its market value.</p>\n\n<p>Members earn time credits by assisting others. The options are endless, but here are some examples: They can drive someone to an appointment, prepare a meal or teach basic skills, such as how to knit or change a tire. After they’ve earned credits, participants can spend them when they need support themselves. So, if you dedicated a total of 60 hours helping others, you could then redeem 60 hours at a future date in the form of someone caring for you.</p>\n\n<p>Mizushima’s <a href=\"https://ijccr.net/2012/08/16/japans-fureai-kippu-time-banking-in-%E2%80%A8elderly-care-origins-development-%E2%80%A8challenges-and-impact/\">Volunteer Labor Bank</a> in Osaka, the world’s first time bank, used a time-based complementary currency known as “love currency,” which members could save for later use or transfer to their relatives. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hourexchangeportland.org/\">Hour Exchange Portland</a>, one of the longest-running time banks in the U.S., is a system where neighbors have traded services using time credits for nearly three decades. It’s among hundreds of time banks operating in the country. </p>\n\n<h2>Resonating with the realities of aging</h2>\n\n<p>We have designed our research to facilitate a comparative investigation of time-banking practices across countries and regions. In the past two years, we have conducted interviews and convened focus groups with dozens of time bank participants and adults who were either middle-aged or over 65 in the U.S. and China. </p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that time banking might be particularly helpful in solving three problems associated with aging that conventional systems fail to address: the affordability of care, the scope of care, and social isolation. </p>\n\n<p>First, as the cost of paid care rises, time credits offer a new way to obtain basic assistance without spending more money. For many families, the ability to pay with their time instead of their money could make caring for their loved ones more affordable.</p>\n\n<p>Time banking also brings visibility to types of labor that market-based systems <a href=\"https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/live/news/2424-as-people-live-longer-family-caregivers-face\">routinely overlook or undercompensate</a>: emotional support, companionship, help with small daily routines, and patient explanations for how new technologies work. These forms of care are rarely paid for, yet they are central to maintaining independence and dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, time banking fosters connections because it doesn’t simply reward transactions. Instead, it assigns value to many kinds of human interactions.</p>\n\n<p>Our interviews indicated that services are exchanged through a wide range of activities: practicing calligraphy with someone else, teaching Tai Chi, reading aloud to someone who is visually impaired, or checking in with a neighbor to remind them to take their medication.</p>\n\n<p>These exchanges are less about specialized skills and more about showing up for one another. They broaden the caregiving ecosystem and remind older adults that they remain essential members of their communities.</p>\n\n<p>As we learned, when older adults engage in time banking, they feel seen, useful and woven into the fabric of community life.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C326%2C6240%2C3510&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An older woman bends over as she vacuums her carpet.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C326%2C6240%2C3510&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707197/original/file-20251208-56-joh0mh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some basic chores get harder to handle as you age.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/elderly-woman-in-a-blue-robe-vacuums-a-patterned-royalty-free-image/2249722370?adppopup=true\">Iuliia Burmistrova/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A path forward</h2>\n\n<p>Creating time banks that can make it easier for families to handle their elder care responsibilities would require meeting numerous challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Some are inherent in time banks.

Yet today, they play a major role in U.S. economic policy, affecting the prices of everything <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/business/economy/trump-tariffs-immigrants-grocery-stores.html\">from groceries</a> <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2025/12/07/car-truck-prices-going-up-how-much-from-tariffs/87551307007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=pp&amp;gca-ds=override\">to autos</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/trump-tariffs-surprise-bills-ups-rcna247051\">to holiday gifts</a>, as well as the outlook for unemployment, inflation and even recession.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/about/our-leaders-and-scholars/faculty-and-academic-divisions/emeriti-faculty-profiles/kent-jones/\">an economist</a> who studies trade policy, and I’ve found that many people have questions about tariffs. This primer explains what they are, what effects they have, and why governments impose them.</p>\n\n<h2>What are tariffs, and who pays them?</h2>\n\n<p>Tariffs are taxes on imports of goods, usually for purposes of protecting particular domestic industries from import competition. When an American business imports goods, U.S. Customs and Border Protection sends it a tariff bill that the company must pay before the merchandise can enter the country.</p>\n\n<p>Because tariffs raise costs for U.S. importers, those companies usually pass the expense on to their customers by raising prices. Sometimes, importers choose to absorb part of the tariff’s cost so consumers don’t switch to more affordable competing products. However, firms with low profit margins may risk going out of business if they do that for very long. In general, the longer tariffs are in place, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hufbauer-and-Zhang_How-Many-Manufacturing-Jobs.pdf\">the more likely</a> companies are to pass the costs on to customers.</p>\n\n<p>Importers can also ask foreign suppliers to absorb some of the tariff cost by lowering their export price. But exporters don’t have an incentive to do that if they can sell to other countries at a higher price.</p>\n\n<p>Studies of Trump’s 2025 tariffs suggest that U.S. consumers and importers are already paying the price, with little evidence that foreign suppliers have borne any of the burden. After six months of the tariffs, importers are absorbing <a href=\"https://www.pricinglab.org/files/TrackingTariffs_Cavallo_Llamas_Vazquez.pdf\">as much as 80% of the cost</a>, which suggests that they believe the tariffs will be temporary. If the Supreme Court allows the Trump tariffs to continue, the burden on consumers <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/who-paying-trumps-tariffs-so-far-its-us-businesses\">will likely increase</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While tariffs apply only to imports, they tend to indirectly boost the prices of domestically produced goods, too. That’s because tariffs reduce demand for imports, which in turn increases the demand for substitutes. This allows domestic producers to <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/why-do-domestic-prices-rise-with-tariffs\">raise their prices as well</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A brief history of tariffs</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/\">U.S. Constitution</a> assigns all tariff- and tax-making power to Congress. Early in U.S. history, tariffs were used to finance the federal government. Especially after the Civil War, when U.S. manufacturing was growing rapidly, tariffs were used to shield U.S. industries from foreign competition. </p>\n\n<p>The introduction of the individual income tax in 1913 displaced tariffs as the main source of U.S. tax revenue. The last major U.S. tariff law was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which established <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-average-u-s-tariff-rate-since-1890/\">an average tariff rate of 20%</a> on all imports by 1933.</p>\n\n<p>Those tariffs <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178066/peddling-protectionism\">sparked foreign retaliation and a global trade war</a> during the Great Depression. After World War II, the U.S. led the formation of the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_01_e.htm\">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a>, or GATT, which promoted tariff reduction policies as the key to economic stability and growth. As a result, global average tariff rates dropped from around 40% in 1947 to 3.5% in 2024. The U.S. average tariff rate fell to 2.5% that year, while about 60% of all U.S. imports <a href=\"https://wits.worldbank.org/CountrySnapshot/en/USA/textview\">entered duty-free</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While Congress is officially responsible for tariffs, it can delegate emergency tariff power to the president for quick action as long as constitutional boundaries are followed. The current Supreme Court case involves Trump’s use of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45618\">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a>, or IEEPA, to unilaterally change all U.S. general tariff rates and duration, country by country, by executive order. The controversy stems from the claim that Trump has overstepped his constitutional authority granted by that act, which <a href=\"https://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/25-1812.OPINION.8-29-2025_2566151.pdf\">does not mention tariffs</a> or specifically authorize the president to impose them.</p>\n\n<h2>The pros and cons of tariffs</h2>\n\n<p>In my view, though, the bigger question is whether tariffs are good or bad policy. The <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gatt-and-global-order-in-the-postwar-era/7CB5B229A4C0D5DBF96E3DB118496716\">disastrous experience</a> of the tariff war during the Great Depression led to a broad global consensus favoring freer trade and lower tariffs. Research in economics and political science tends to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gatt-and-global-order-in-the-postwar-era/7CB5B229A4C0D5DBF96E3DB118496716\">back up this view</a>, although tariffs have never disappeared as a policy tool, particularly for developing countries with limited sources of tax revenue and the desire to protect their fledgling industries from imports.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Trump has resurrected tariffs not only as a protectionist device, but also as a source of government revenue for the world’s largest economy. In fact, Trump insists that tariffs can <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/\">replace individual income taxes</a>, a view <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs\">contested by most economists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Trump’s tariffs have a protectionist purpose: to favor domestic industries by raising import prices and shifting demand to domestically produced goods. The aim is to increase domestic output and employment in tariff-protected industries, whose success is presumably more valuable to the economy than the open market allows. The success of this approach depends on labor, capital and long-term investment flowing into protected sectors in ways that improve their efficiency, growth and employment.</p>\n\n<p>Critics argue that tariffs come with trade-offs: Favoring one set of industries necessarily disfavors others, and it <a href=\"https://www.sphere-ed.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/sphere-economic-lesson-comparative-advantage.pdf\">raises prices for consumers</a>. Manipulating prices and demand results in <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/how-many-manufacturing-jobs-will-trumps-tariffs-create-and-at-what-cost/\">market inefficiency</a>, as the U.S. economy produces more goods that are less efficiently made and fewer that are more efficiently made. In addition, U.S. tariffs have already resulted in foreign retaliatory trade actions, <a href=\"https://www.wita.org/atp-research/how-countries-retaliating-tariffs/\">damaging U.S. exporters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s tariffs also carry an uncertainty cost because he is <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/trumps-trade-war-timeline-20-date-guide\">constantly threatening, changing, canceling and reinstating them</a>. Companies and financiers tend to invest in protected industries only if tariff levels are predictable. But Trump’s negotiating strategy has involved numerous reversals and new threats, making it difficult for investors to calculate the value of those commitments. One study estimates that such uncertainty has actually <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2025/4/10/economic-effects-of-president-trumps-tariffs\">reduced U.S. investment by 4.4%</a> in 2025. </p>\n\n<p>A major, if underappreciated, cost of Trump’s tariffs is that they have violated U.S. global trade agreements and GATT rules on nondiscrimination and tariff-binding. This has made the U.S. a less reliable trading partner. The U.S. had <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_United_States_and_the_Global_Economy.html?id=Y4fXgtvip84C\">previously championed this system</a>, which brought stability and cooperation to global trade relations. Now that the U.S. is conducting trade policy through unilateral tariff hikes and antagonistic rhetoric, its trading partners are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hit-by-trump-tariffs-rest-world-races-forge-new-trade-alliances-2025-10-01/\">already beginning to look</a> for new, more stable and growing trade relationships. </p>\n\n<p>So what’s next? Trump has vowed to use <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/trump-tariff-alternatives.html\">other emergency tariff measures</a> if the Supreme Court strikes down his IEEPA tariffs. So as long as Congress is unwilling to step in, it’s likely that an aggressive U.S. tariff regime will continue, regardless of the court’s judgment. That means public awareness of tariffs ⁠– and of who pays them and what they change ⁠– will remain crucial for understanding the direction of the U.S. economy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271576/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kent Jones does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

He seems to have achieved the hallmarks of the American dream: He’s taken over his father’s loan business, married the love of his life and fathered four excessively adorable children. But George feels stifled and beaten down. His Uncle Billy has misplaced US$8,000 of the company’s money, and the town’s resident tyrant, Mr. Potter, is using the mishap to try to ruin George, who’s his last remaining business competitor. </p>\n\n<p>An angel named Clarence is tasked with pulling George back from the brink. To stop him from attempting suicide, Clarence decides to show George what life would have been like if he’d never been born. In this alternate reality, Bedford Falls is called Pottersville, a place Mr. Potter runs as a ruthless banker and slumlord.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Movie still

The Potter subplot encapsulates the film’s most trenchant, still-resonant themes: the unfairness of socioeconomic injustices; the pervasiveness of corporate and political corruption; the threat of monopolized power; the need for affordable housing.</p>\n\n<p>These themes had, of course, run through many of Capra’s prewar films as well: “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027996/\">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030993/\">You Can’t Take It with You</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033891/\">Meet John Doe</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/\">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>,” the last of which also starred Jimmy Stewart. </p>\n\n<p>But they take on a different kind of weight in “It’s a Wonderful Life” – a weight that’s especially visible on the weathered face of Stewart, who himself had just returned from a harrowing four-year tour of duty as a bomber pilot in Europe. </p>\n\n<p>The idealistic vigor with which Stewart had fought crooked politicians and oligarchs as Mr. Smith is replaced by the bitterness, exhaustion, frustration and desperation with which he battles against Mr. Potter as George Bailey.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white movie still of a distraught man with snow on his jacket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=447&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=447&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=447&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=562&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=562&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707478/original/file-20251209-56-x58u5p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=562&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">George Bailey feels helpless in the face of corruption and cruelty.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Paramount</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Life after Pottersville</h2>\n\n<p>By the time George has begged and pleaded his way out of Pottersville, the lost $8,000 is no longer top of mind.

In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinvigorates-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry\">promote coal exports</a> and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.</p>\n\n<p>But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been <a href=\"https://minesafety.wv.gov/historical-statistical-data/fatal-accident-summaries/\">five coal-mining deaths</a> in West Virginia and at <a href=\"https://www.msha.gov/data-and-reports/fatality-reports/search?combine=coal&amp;field_mine_category_target_id=All&amp;year=2025&amp;location_node_administrative_area=All\">least two others elsewhere</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large industrial area with towers, a rail line and large buildings with large metal connections.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=261&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=261&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=261&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=328&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=328&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705686/original/file-20251201-66-h4wxh9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=328&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A coal-fired power plant in Michigan has remained open at Trump administration orders.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/west-olive-michigan-the-j-h-campbell-coal-fired-power-plant-news-photo/2225114161\">Jim West/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A long legacy</h2>\n\n<p>Until 2015, coal-fired power plants <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=43675\">generated more electricity than any other</a> type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a <a href=\"https://www.chicagobooth.edu/magazine/history-of-fracking\">new type of hydraulic fracturing</a>, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/05/20/how-natural-gas-and-renewables-dethroned-coal-in-america/\">overcame coal</a> in the U.S. power supply.</p>\n\n<p>Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as <a href=\"https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/coal-business-wyoming\">Wyoming</a> and <a href=\"https://appalachianmemories.org/2025/01/08/coal-camps-in-appalachia-in-the-1940s-life-in-the-shadows-of-industry/\">Appalachia</a> – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124561\">key employers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be <a href=\"https://www.power-eng.com/coal/coal-stockpiles-at-plants-to-remain-healthy/\">piled up on-site at power plants</a> without needing a tank or underground facility for storage. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/owcp/dcmwc/statistics/PartsBandCBeneficiaries\">black lung</a>. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/owcp/dcmwc\">monthly payments to family members</a> of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, <a href=\"https://news.utexas.edu/2023/11/27/coal-power-killed-half-a-million-people-in-u-s-over-two-decades/\">prematurely killing half a million people</a> in the United States from 1999 through 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to <a href=\"https://www.msha.gov/data-and-reports/fatality-reports/search\">miner deaths</a>, such as the recent <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2025/11/13/wv-coal-mine-flooded/stories/202511130066\">drowning of a miner</a> in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the <a href=\"https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/mine-disaster-investigations-2000\">Big Branch Mine explosion</a> in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined.

The <a href=\"https://nyisoviewer.etariff.biz/ViewerDocLibrary/FercOrders/20180108%20Ordr%20Trnmnt%20RM%20Intt%20Nw%20Prcdng_21291.pdf\">commission declined</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In his second term, Trump is more broadly using <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-us-energy-market-has-its-troubles-though-it-may-not-be-a-national-emergency-249336\">powers granted to the president in emergencies</a>, and he is seeking to subsidize coal <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinvigorates-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry/\">across the board</a> – in mining, power plants and exports.</p>\n\n<p>At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-accelerates-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\">Trump administration champions</a>. Many individual data centers use as much power as a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/data-centers-powering-ai-could-use-more-electricity-than-entire-cities.html\">small or medium city</a>. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by <a href=\"https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/publications/rethinking-load-growth\">activating power plants that are idle most of the time</a> and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – <a href=\"https://www.devsustainability.com/p/why-dont-data-centers-demand-response\">which it’s not clear they would agree to do</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/fossil-fuel-gas-coal-climate-data-centers/753565/\">old coal-fired power plants</a> – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A long train of cargo cars carrying a black substance stretches to the horizon.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705689/original/file-20251201-56-lchtq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The sun rises on a coal train outside Ritzville, Wash.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/sunrise-of-coal-train-full-of-coal-outside-of-ritzville-news-photo/2226836397\">Visions of America/Joseph Sohm/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Limits remain</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the Trump adminstration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2025/06/08/coal-power-costs-soar-28-since-2021-rising-faster-than-inflation/\">coal is more expensive</a> than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48936\">Half of U.S. coal mines have closed</a> within the past two decades, and <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/coal/annual/\">productivity at the remaining mines is declining</a> due to a <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64924\">variety of factors</a>, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=66524\">exports have also seen declines</a> in the midst of the tariff wars.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-07/company-bids-less-than-a-penny-per-ton-in-biggest-us-coal-sale-in-over-a-decade\">less than a penny per ton</a>. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the <a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/report/the-coal-cost-crossover-3-0/\">high cost of running old coal plants</a> as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus-lcoeplus/\">Natural gas is cheaper</a> – and, in some places, so are renewable energy and battery storage. Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term. In the long term, however, <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/nowhere-go-down-us-coal-capacity-generation\">coal faces a very uncertain future</a> as a part of the U.S. electricity mix.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269668/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Hannah Wiseman is affiliated with the Center for Progressive Reform.

More than 15% were very preterm, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preterm-birth\">meaning they were born before 32 weeks</a>. A full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Florida’s rate is slightly higher, at about <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/florida/prematurity-profile\">1 in 9 babies born preterm</a>. In an average week, 456 of the 4,257 babies born in the state will be preterm, and 75 of those will be very preterm.</p>\n\n<p>According to the March of Dimes, preterm birth and low birthweight-related health complications <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/united-states/prematurity-profile\">cause 37.5% of infant deaths</a> nationwide. This makes preterm birth the second-leading cause of infant deaths, after birth defects. Preterm babies who survive infancy are susceptible to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21479-premature-birth\">health complications later in life</a>, including cerebral palsy and learning disabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Preterm and <a href=\"https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=low-birth-weight-90-P02382\">low-birthweight babies</a> – those weighing less than 5.5 pounds (2,500 grams) – are far more likely to <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/find-support/topics/neonatal-intensive-care-unit-nicu/your-babys-nicu-stay\">go to the neonatal intensive care unit</a>, or NICU. Very preterm infants tend to have the longest NICU stays, <a href=\"https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb163.pdf\">averaging around 43 days</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the emotional toll this takes on a family, preterm births and their resulting health complications carry substantial financial costs. The average NICU admission in 2021 <a href=\"https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals-dropdown/all-hcci-reports/nicu-use-and-spending-1\">cost around US$71,000</a>. And economists estimated the lifetime societal cost of all preterm babies born in 2016, from birth to subsequent disability care, at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semperi.2021.151390\">$25.2 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We are a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1464YEAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">public policy Ph.D. student</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0GrgbR4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">public policy researcher</a> focusing on health policy and population health outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, we were sifting through the data on preterm and low birthweight rates in the U.S., in search of places that are doing better than average at preventing preterm births. And that is what we found in the <a href=\"https://www.reachupincorporated.org/our-story/\">Central Hillsborough Healthy Start</a> program, which serves a cluster of <a href=\"https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/\">Tampa ZIP codes with roughly 177,000 residents</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, this program published records showing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-008-0400-y\">30% lower preterm and low-birthweight rates</a> among families at highest risk. Peer-reviewed evaluations link participation in the program to substantial reductions in preterm and low-birthweight outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>These remarkable improvements <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.7712\">remained consistent through 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When we looked at what this program is doing, we found a set of practices that can serve as a model for other counties in Florida and around the U.S. to lower preterm birth rates, saving money and, more importantly, lives.</p>\n\n<h2>Screening for risk factors</h2>\n\n<p>The program does early screening for risk factors of preterm birth using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.7712\">Florida’s Healthy Start prenatal risk screen</a> at the pregnant person’s first prenatal visit. This screening has been proven to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.7712\">correctly flag a good share of higher-risk pregnancies</a>, while avoiding many false alarms, helping scarce services reach families who need them most.</p>\n\n<p>This is key, because the risk of preterm birth isn’t spread out evenly across all pregnancies. The <a href=\"https://www.tgh.org/about-tgh/community-health-and-wellness/community-health-assessment\">neighborhoods that Central Hillsborough Healthy Start serves</a> include many young, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/175204\">Black</a>, unmarried, <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/united-states/prematurity-profile/\">low-income</a> families that are eligible for Medicaid. All of these factors place them at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-008-0400-y\">high risk for preterm birth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Early screening allows the Healthy Start program to identify mothers at highest risk and tailor its resources to assist them.</p>\n\n<h2>Measuring against the rest of the state</h2>\n\n<p>The Florida Healthy Start prenatal risk screen is available throughout the state.

These programs are critical, because <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21479-premature-birth\">obesity, diabetes, hypertension and smoking during pregnancy</a> are significant risk factors for preterm births.</p>\n\n<p>The program also helps to connect patients to resources they may need during and after pregnancy by making personal introductions to <a href=\"https://www.healthystartcoalition.org/\">community partners</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.healthystartcoalition.org/wirs-at-wic\">women and infant resource specialists</a> in women, infants and children, or WIC, clinics. </p>\n\n<p>Healthy Start workers also connect patients to <a href=\"https://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/childrens-health/healthy-start/\">interconception care</a> for healthy birth spacing between pregnancies, which can help prevent future preterm births. Studies show that more than 30% of U.S. mothers who give birth preterm conceived their baby <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/united-states/prematurity-profile/\">less than 18 months after having their previous child</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Healthy Start staff use <a href=\"https://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/childrens-health/healthy-start/_documents/chapter-4-coordinated-intake-and-referral-3-2019.pdf\">Florida’s coordinated intake and referral approach</a> to track referrals and follow up across partners. This is vital to helping the program’s staff see who has been contacted, which services were delivered and whether referrals took place. They can then follow up if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2>Stability and sustainability</h2>\n\n<p>Central Hillsborough Healthy Start operates through a local nonprofit, <a href=\"https://www.reachupincorporated.org/central-hillsborough-healthy-start/\">REACHUP Inc.</a>, in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/\">University of South Florida</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.healthystartcoalition.org/\">Hillsborough Healthy Start Coalition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Its funding comes primarily from the federal government through the <a href=\"https://taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/RecipDetail?arg_EntityId=n55BDVF5ylXzv6fMHn%2B%2F5A%3D%3D\">Health Resources and Services Administration’s national Healthy Start program</a>. The program’s <a href=\"https://taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/AwardDetail?arg_AwardNum=H4912793&amp;arg_ProgOfficeCode=192\">current federal funding</a> extends into 2029. But <a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/whats-in-the-fy2026-budget-for-babies/\">proposed changes to the federal budget</a> threaten to eliminate this funding altogether. </p>\n\n<p>The program’s budget is supplemented by <a href=\"https://www.reachupincorporated.org/benefactors/\">local partners</a>, including Hillsborough County, which helps sustain operations despite federal uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Locally, the <a href=\"https://www.healthystartcoalition.org/\">Hillsborough coalition’s portfolio</a> includes programs that work together like one team, sharing information so families keep getting help even when one grant ends. These partnerships with local community organizations allow the program to remain stable.</p>\n\n<h2>A model for others</h2>\n\n<p>Looking at the data, we believe Central Hillsborough Healthy Start has succeeded by using the same basic approach for everyone, then customizing. Everyone gets screened early and set up with nurse visits. Then, its adds what each family needs so that support fits real life.</p>\n\n<p>The Central Hillsborough story shows that health disparities are not inevitable. And this model can serve as a feasible blueprint for other communities. With early identification, consistent support and sustained investment, the outcomes for mothers and babies can improve dramatically.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation focused on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268058/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

I was excited to hear them talk about their new book and their history of working together, so I was confused but delighted when their conversation took a turn toward <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=02G3EdMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">my area of expertise – electronic health records</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One actress noted that on a recent trip to the optometrist, she was asked about her ethnicity. “And I was like, what difference does it make?” she said.</p>\n\n<p>The host chimed in with her experience of being asked similarly personal questions before a mammogram. “Like, it doesn’t matter if I’m married or not. It doesn’t matter if I’m white or Asian, you know?” she remarked.</p>\n\n<p>Listening to the host and actresses question a process that, to me, seems straightforward and purposeful served as a stark reminder of the chasm that often exists between how <a href=\"https://fairbanks.indianapolis.iu.edu/about/directory/inderstrodt-jill.html\">researchers like me</a> use patient data and a patient’s actual experience of clinical data collection.</p>\n\n<p>For those of us who use demographic data collected during health care encounters to conduct research and design interventions, it does matter whether patients answer their doctor’s demographic questions. But as a patient myself, I can see how these questions might seem unnecessary and even invasive.</p>\n\n<p>So it may help to understand why your doctors collect this data, how researchers use it and what medical discoveries might be possible when we know more about who patients are.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"patient sitting on table looks at doctor filling out form on clipboard\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707180/original/file-20251208-56-q1ihuy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Your doctor’s questions might sometimes seem arbitrary and invasive.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/african-american-female-patient-visiting-doctor-royalty-free-image/1386035214?phrase=patients%20doctors%20office%20forms&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Natalia Gdovskaia/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why your data matters</h2>\n\n<p>When you answer the demographic questions your doctor logs in your electronic health record, you’re doing more than disclosing personal information. You’re adding one small piece to a giant puzzle of data that allows researchers like me to see a bigger picture. </p>\n\n<p>Your health information can help us understand who gets sick and why. It might even be used to design real health interventions.</p>\n\n<p>As a researcher focused on improving health and health care for moms and their babies, I consider myself lucky to live in Indiana, a state with one of the nation’s most comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.ihie.org/\">health information exchanges</a>. These exchanges are interconnected networks of hospital system electronic health record databases from all over the state that allow researchers like me to learn about how individuals and groups experience health and medical care.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my colleagues and I in the Indiana University <a href=\"https://news.iu.edu/publichealth/live/news/46672-fairbanks-school-researcher-joins-statewide-team\">Better AI for a Strong Rural Maternal and Child Health Environment Lab</a> use this data to train machine learning models that predict <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/find-support/topics/pregnancy/preeclampsia\">preeclampsia</a>, a life-threatening condition of high blood pressure during pregnancy, before a mom gets really sick.</p>\n\n<p>We could use only clinical data: diagnoses, labs and vital readings like blood pressure that contribute to the outcome of preeclampsia. But for conditions like preeclampsia, Black moms are diagnosed at higher rates than their white counterparts. Research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.007546\">race and racism can be major contributing factors</a> to this disparity.</p>\n\n<p>In order to predict preeclampsia accurately and use these predictions to help doctors monitor, diagnose and treat the condition, my team needs to factor in other information that can illuminate these different outcomes, called <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health\">social determinants of health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Social determinants of health are the parts of ourselves and our environments that drive our health status. Race itself isn’t a social determinant of health, but racism is. This includes structural racism, like a ZIP code’s history of school segregation or redlining. If available, we also include information you might have given at your doctor’s visit, like if you haven’t had enough food to eat in the past month, or if you have a history of intimate partner violence or homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>Because there is more variation within races than between them, race alone actually tells us very little. Including social determinants of health in our datasets provides added context as to how you move about the world, what resources you have access to and how your environment might shape your health.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utBlfjihvAs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Social determinants of health are the environmental and social conditions that can affect the health of individuals and communities.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>\n\n<p>This is why your cardiologist asks about your marital status. Your response might help researchers understand why single moms are more likely to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahjo.2021.100015\">cardiovascular disease</a> than their married counterparts. And telling your optometrist your race is one of the only ways to learn what role race might play in patients using weight loss drugs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.10318\">experiencing vision loss</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other researchers have used data from electronic records to determine how many people in a geographic area or of a certain demographic group <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-073791\">have diabetes</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.42222\">to predict dementia</a> and even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13061028\">to track gum disease</a>.</p>\n\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers used data from electronic health records to determine what types of people were getting sick. They investigated COVID-19 patients’ <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.4223\">race</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88130-w\">geography</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.22360\">insurance status</a>. Researchers continue to use this data to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2025.102935\">track long COVID</a>, a condition that health professionals still don’t completely understand.</p>\n\n<h2>Honoring patient privacy</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, these health information exchanges are careful about how and with whom they share patient data. The data is tailored to the needs of the study and shared in compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a>, or HIPAA.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, for my most recent preeclampsia study, the health care system sent a dataset that contained limited pieces of personal information, like the baby’s birth date, the mom’s birth date – since we often need to know how old she was when she gave birth – and their ZIP code so we can see trends in preeclampsia across geographic areas.</p>\n\n<p>The data wasn’t allowed out of the health system’s virtual private network, so the data remains within our firewall. This ensures that the data remains safe. And all of this must be approved by our university’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.15-0706\">institutional review board</a>, a rigorous process that ensures our research can’t harm participants. </p>\n\n<h2>Improving health care for everyone – including you</h2>\n\n<p>All of this research drives innovation and serves as a basis for the programs, protocols and policies that improve health – from you as an individual all the way to the national and even global level.</p>\n\n<p>Your doctor can use the information you provide to recommend services or therapies for you. For instance, if your doctor finds out through check-in questioning that you haven’t had enough food in the past month, they can refer you to a nutrition program, sometimes run by the <a href=\"https://www.ecommunity.com/locations/community-cupboard-lawrence\">hospital system</a> itself. If you were married at your last appointment but now list your marital status as “separated,” your doctor can check in with you to see if you need any additional mental health or social services.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s normal for these personal questions to feel a little uncomfortable, it helps to remember that there is a good reason your doctor is asking them. Your data can help move medical research forward.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268268/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jill Inderstrodt receives funding from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health.   </span></em></p>",

Judean culture had been transformed by Greek influence for centuries, but Antiochus attempted to quash Judean religious distinctiveness altogether. This led to a rebellion by the Hasmonean family, <a href=\"https://ia801404.us.archive.org/29/items/from-maccabees-to-mishnah-shaye-j.-d.-cohen/From%20Maccabees%20to%20Mishnah%20%28Shaye%20J.D.%20Cohen%29.pdf\">known also as the Maccabees</a>. They established a dynasty that lasted until the conquest by Rome in 63 B.C.E. </p>\n\n<p>The story is preserved in the Books of the Maccabees, written during the second and first centuries B.C.E. Some Christians consider the texts part of the Bible, though Jews today do not. The first rabbis working 2,000 years ago left it out of the Jewish Bible.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://history.ucdavis.edu/people/joshua-shanes\">scholar of modern Jewish religion and politics</a>, I have always been fascinated by the ways in which modern Jews pick and choose from the well of tradition to construct a form of Jewishness they feel is authentic. </p>\n\n<p>Hanukkah serves as a prime example of this process.</p>\n\n<h2>What does the holiday celebrate?</h2>\n\n<p>The eight-day holiday has two traditional components. On the one hand, its liturgy gives thanks to God for the military victory. This reflects the original pre-rabbinic core of the holiday, which was declared by the new Hasmonean dynasty to celebrate its triumph.</p>\n\n<p>The primary ritual of the holiday, however, is the lighting of the Hanukkah menorah. It celebrates the legend of a single flask of pure oil found in the Temple that was sufficient for just one day, but miraculously burned for eight.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white sketch depicts several soldiers destroying statues and other things, while others with stern expressions stand alongside them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=415&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=415&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=415&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707355/original/file-20251209-56-230hh6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A sketch illustrating Judas Maccabeus’ orders to priests to cleanse the temple sanctuary.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cleansing-the-temple-in-jerusalem-history-of-the-maccabees-news-photo/2238465281?adppopup=true\">Sepia Times/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The earliest version of this story appears in the Talmud – the main collection of rabbinic laws and commentary – some 500 years after the story occurred. The founders of Rabbinic Judaism – the Judaism of the past 2,000 years – were <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/uncovering-the-truth-about-chanukah\">apparently uncomfortable with its military message</a> and reshaped the holiday to give it new meaning. </p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/uncovering-the-truth-about-chanukah\">words</a> of historian <a href=\"https://www.malkasimkovich.com/\">Malka Simkovich</a>, “Instead of glorying military prowess, the holiday instead glorifies the unconditional and miraculous divine light that Jews can depend on, even in the gloomiest of darkness.” This reflects Rabbinic Judaism’s tendency to reread biblical and other texts about land and power as metaphors for spiritual growth and faith.</p>\n\n<p>Though popular today, Hanukkah is traditionally a minor holiday on which work is permitted. Over time, it developed into a celebration emphasizing family and children, games and gifts and special foods.</p>\n\n<h2>Modernity brings new meanings</h2>\n\n<p>In the 19th century, this shared meaning of the holiday changed. In <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-hanukkah-came-to-america-106426\">America</a> and <a href=\"https://brill.com/display/book/edcoll/9789047402435/B9789047402435_s013.xml\">parts of Europe</a>, Jews experienced emancipation and economic mobilization and sought ways to integrate into their local national communities. </p>\n\n<p>As Jews became more integrated into wider society, Hanukkah served as an opportunity to celebrate at a time of year when their Christian neighbors were <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/christmassocialh0000conn/page/n7/mode/2up\">doing the same</a>. They continued to celebrate the holiday in its rabbinic, spiritual meaning, however. As the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.yivo.org/article/105\">pioneering European Hebrew newspaper Hamagid</a> wrote in 1857: “More than we recall the physical valor of the Maccabees, we understand the war as a struggle for spiritual deliverance from Greek culture.”</p>\n\n<p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/zionism/9780813576107\">Zionism, the Jewish nationalist movement</a> born in the 1880s in Europe, that defined Jews as a modern nation rather than just a religion. It hoped one day to establish a home in Palestine, the site of the ancient Israelite kingdoms. They used Jewish traditions, especially pre-rabbinic biblical traditions about Jews living in that land, to prove the validity of their worldview. </p>\n\n<p>Zionists quickly adopted Hanukkah as their most important holiday. They did this for a variety of reasons, but most important was its easy reformulation into a secular nationalist festival. </p>\n\n<h2>Zionism remakes Hanukkah</h2>\n\n<p>Hanukkah was not merely repackaged by Zionists in Europe; it was totally transformed from a relatively minor holiday into the central annual celebration of the movement. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, while the miracle of the oil defined traditional celebrations, it was specifically the military victory that defined Zionist ones. For the fledgling nationalist movement, the ancient story gave a historical example of Jewish heroes who successfully fought to expel foreign invaders from their homeland. </p>\n\n<p>They exemplified the “new Jew,” the “Jew of muscle” that their <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/zionism-and-the-fin-de-siecle/paper\">leaders promoted</a>, in contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/260942?seq=1\">European stereotype</a> of Jews as weak or bookish.</p>\n\n<p>The role of God and even the Temple was limited; the story was refocused on the nation and its military struggle for freedom and independence. <a href=\"https://brill.com/display/book/edcoll/9789047402435/B9789047402435_s013.xml\">Hanukkah offered weapons, heroes and victories, writes</a> historian <a href=\"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9670-francois-guesnet\">Francois Guesnet</a>: “It was an occasion to confront the glorious past with the needs of the contemporary national re-awakening.”</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Zionist Hanukkah celebrations also connected the movement to Jewish religious observance, thereby appealing to traditional groups without alienating its secular core. After all, Hanukkah was a traditional Jewish celebration, and since work is allowed, they were not violating any ritual laws with their events.</p>\n\n<p>Orthodox leaders did not buy it. </p>\n\n<p>In Sanz, for example – a city today in Poland – the Zionists’ first Hanukkah celebration in 1900 raised a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/history/european-history-after-1450/diaspora-nationalism-and-jewish-identity-habsburg-galicia?format=PB&amp;isbn=9781107674899\">storm of protest</a> by local Hasidic leaders. They accused the Zionists of desanctifying the holiday and defiling the Hanukkah miracle. They even complained that the Zionists defiled the Star of David by using it in their signage and directed that the emblem be torn off the Holy Ark in the synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, the Zionists’ version of Hanukkah largely won, especially in Israel. Zionists brought these values into the new Jewish state that they succeeded in  creating in 1948. But it has also been embraced by many Jews in the diaspora. </p>\n\n<h2>Other meanings persist</h2>\n\n<p>The rabbinic tradition has not disappeared. There are still ultra-Orthodox Jews who reject the Zionist return to pre-rabbinic traditions of the Book of Maccabees, for example. There are also many liberal Jews, especially young Jews, who reject the infusion of Zionism into their Jewish identity. </p>\n\n<p>These numbers have grown <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/186698/october-7-anniversary-american-jewry-broken-half\">in recent years</a> due to Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. </p>\n\n<p>The Book of Maccabees describes the battle against Antiochus being preceded by a battle against Jews who sided with him. As a result, it has become almost an annual tradition for Jews to accuse each other of representing that traitorous group and to claim that one’s own camp represents the true Jews. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man and a woman dressed in black bending down while lighting candles placed inside a glass box mounted on a wall.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707544/original/file-20251209-56-id3xqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man and woman light candles on the second night of Hanukkah, in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem, on Dec. 13, 2017.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-ultra-orthodox-jewish-man-and-woman-light-candles-on-the-news-photo/891685490?adppopup=true\">Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Some Jews <a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/chanukkah-the-most-zionist-of-holidays-an-in-depth-historical-look/\">will write editorials</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JewishLifeNow/posts/pfbid0aWJt9M6Zou7cprv53ad5cs8KtX3NwaDEVD3f9us3hz1X51deRnYbNG2xUVef79bSl\">social media posts</a> about how Hanukkah “proves” that Zionism is the authentic interpretation of Jewish tradition.

Their opponents <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/zionism-made-hanukkah-about-israel-but-its-always-been-a-holiday-of-diaspora/\">respond with articles</a> about Hanukkah’s history as a rabbinic holiday and how it has been reinterpreted since the start of the Zionist movement. </p>\n\n<p>Each argues that their own interpretation is the correct one.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, Judaism is constantly being made and remade. Is Hanukkah’s “real” meaning the Zionist return to pre-rabbinic sources? Or is it the rabbinic spiritualization of the holiday and its metaphor of bringing light into darkness? There is no clear answer.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, both sides have sources to support their interpretation. Zionists can draw on the military imagery featured in the First Book of Maccabees and other sources. For those who prefer the holiday as presented by the rabbis who founded Rabbinic Judaism 2,000 years ago, there is an equal wealth of material, including in the prayers recited in synagogues.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbis assigned a special reading from the later biblical books for each Sabbath and holiday. Their choice for the Sabbath of Hanukkah – <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.4?lang=en\">Zechariah 2:14-4:7</a> – is revealing: “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: ‘Not by military might and not by physical power, but by My spirit,’ says the Lord of Hosts.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271624/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Shanes does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Each carbon credit is supposed to represent the reduction or prevention of one metric ton of carbon dioxide. </p>\n\n<p>However, carbon offset projects have <a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/repository-of-articles\">come under scrutiny in recent years</a>. Tree-planting projects, the most common type, take time to meet their promise as the trees grow, and <a href=\"https://carboncredits.com/the-pitfalls-of-low-quality-carbon-offsets-are-they-a-threat-to-our-planet/\">wildfires and logging can wipe out the benefit</a>. Studies have found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51151-w\">companies tend to buy cheap</a>, low-quality carbon credits, which run a risk of exaggerating their carbon reduction claims or providing <a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research-and-impact/publications/quality-assessment-of-redd-carbon-credit-projects\">results that would have happened anyway</a>, leaving no real climate benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, several teams, perhaps unknowingly, have been purchasing fraudulent or low-quality credits.</p>\n\n<h2>Reputations at risk</h2>\n\n<p>FIFA brought the sports world’s carbon offset problem into the spotlight during the <a href=\"https://www.si.com/soccer/2022/11/01/sports-greenwashing-daily-cover\">2022 Qatar World Cup</a>.</p>\n\n<p>FIFA claimed the event would be carbon neutral, but that claim <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2023/07/03/the-2022-qatar-world-cup-was-greenwashed-the-swiss-fairness-commission-finds-in-favor-of-six-ngos-alleging-misleading-and-unfair-advertisement-by-fifa/\">relied on creative accounting</a> that understated the event’s construction and travel emissions. Organizers also used <a href=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/publications/poor-tackling-yellow-card-for-2022-fifa-world-cups-carbon-neutrality-claim/\">low-quality offsets</a>. Many of those offsets were renewable energy projects with a high likelihood of being built anyway.</p>\n\n<p>A year after the tournament, FIFA had completed offset purchases for <a href=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/06/07/foul-play-advertising-regulator-gives-fifa-red-card-for-billing-world-cup-as-carbon-neutral/\">less than a third</a> of the World Cup’s estimated emissions, the nonprofit Carbon Market Watch found. And Switzerland’s advertising regulator <a href=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/06/07/foul-play-advertising-regulator-gives-fifa-red-card-for-billing-world-cup-as-carbon-neutral/\">ordered FIFA to stop</a> claiming the World Cup had been “carbon neutral.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A view across the stands during a game at Fenway Park under the lights.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704346/original/file-20251124-66-w7nd64.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In 2022, the Boston Red Sox announced a plan to route a portion of the proceeds from every ticket purchased at Fenway Park to a carbon offset project run by Aspiration.

Team owner <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/clippers-steve-ballmer-defends-self-team-from-accusations-of-cap-circumvention-they-conned-me\">Steve Ballmer, who personally invested at least $50 million</a> in Aspiration, told ESPN he and the team did nothing wrong. “<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46161800/clippers-ballmer-details-affiliation-aspiration-wake-kawhi-leonard-report\">They conned me</a>,” he said. </p>\n\n<p>While the scandal focused on financial fraud and the salary cap, it also raised questions about the team’s sustainability claim.</p>\n\n<h2>Without verification, who knows?</h2>\n\n<p>In some cases, the value of offset projects is difficult to verify, even when trees are being planted nearby.</p>\n\n<p>The Seattle Sounders FC declared itself the <a href=\"https://www.soundersfc.com/news/sounders-fc-becomes-first-carbon-neutral-professional-soccer-team-north-america\">first carbon-neutral professional soccer team</a> in North America in 2019 by cutting its waste, water and energy use and offsetting its remaining emissions <a href=\"https://forterra.org/our-work/programs/evergreen-restoration-program/\">through the nonprofit organization Forterra</a>, which plants trees <a href=\"https://forterra.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ECC-and-ERP-Planting-Sites.pdf\">in the Puget Sound region</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the effort <a href=\"https://www.lumenfield.com/venue-info/sustainability\">positioned the club as a sustainability leader</a>, the offsets lacked what’s known as third-party verification. Similar to how organic food must be certified by reputable agencies, third-party validation of carbon credits ensures credits truly represent the removal of carbon from the atmosphere or avoided emissions.</p>\n\n<p>Without verification, it’s unclear whether claimed emission reductions are permanent, accurately tracked and transparently reported.</p>\n\n<h2>Potential legal consequences</h2>\n\n<p>Even the most prominent venues are susceptible to issues with unreliable credits.</p>\n\n<p>Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle has been celebrated as the world’s <a href=\"https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en/Stories/climate-pledge-arena-first-zero-carbon-certified-arena#main-navigation\">first “zero-carbon” certified arena</a>, with electric Zambonis, recycled materials, renewable energy and free public transit.

Yet the technology is far from mature. Large language models advance rapidly  <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/gpt-5-vs-gpt-4-heres-whats-different-and-whats-not-in-chatgpts-latest-upgrade\">from one generation to the next</a>, and experts can only speculate how AI will affect the workforce and peoples’ daily lives. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-mml/peter-mullner/\">materials scientist</a>, I am interested in how materials and the technologies that derive from them affect society. AI is one example of a technology driving global change – particularly through its demand for materials and rare minerals.</p>\n\n<p>But before AI evolved to its current level, two other technologies exemplified the process created by the demand for specialized materials: cars and smartphones. </p>\n\n<p>Often, the mass adoption of a new invention changes human behavior, which leads to new technologies and infrastructures reliant upon the invention. In turn, these new technologies and infrastructures <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-glass-and-steel-to-rare-earth-metals-new-materials-have-changed-society-throughout-history-258244\">require new or improved materials</a> – and these often contain <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals\">critical minerals</a>: those minerals that are both essential to the technology and strain the supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/fs20253038\">unequal distribution</a> of these minerals gives leverage to the nations that produce them. The resulting power shifts strain geopolitical relations and drive the search for new mineral sources. New technology nurtures the mining industry.</p>\n\n<h2>The car and the development of suburbs</h2>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1913/dec/vol-10-manufactures.html\">only 5 out of 1,000</a> people owned a car, with annual production around a few thousand. Workers commuted on foot or by tram. Within a <a href=\"http://www.honolulutraffic.com/Book_Chapter_1.pdf\">two-mile radius</a>, many people had all they needed: from groceries to hardware, from school to church, and from shoemakers to doctors. </p>\n\n<p>Then in 1913, Henry Ford transformed the industry by inventing the assembly line. Now, a middle class family could afford a car: Mass production cut the price of the Model T from US$850 in 1908 to <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/October-7/moving-assembly-line-at-ford\">$360 in 1916</a>.

But building these required better materials. </p>\n\n<p>In 1970, the entire frame and body of a car was made from one steel type, but by 2017, 10 different, highly specialized steels constituted a vehicle’s <a href=\"https://autocomponentsindia.com/lightweighting-lies-heavy-on-automotive-industry/\">light-weight form</a>. Each steel contains different chemical elements, such as molybdenum and vanadium, which are mined only in a few countries. </p>\n\n<p>While the car supply chain was mostly <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub1712.pdf\">domestic until the 1970s</a>, the car industry today <a href=\"https://www.aftermarketnews.com/world-us-auto-parts-come/\">relies heavily on imports</a>.

In 1983, Motorola released the <a href=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/about/history/explore-motorola-heritage/cell-phone-development.html\">DynaTAC</a>, the first commercial cellular phone. It was heavy, expensive and its battery lasted for only half an hour, so few people had one. Then in 1996, Motorola <a href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co430373/motorola-startac-mobile-phone-1997\">introduced the flip phone</a>, which was cheaper, lighter and more convenient to use. The flip phone initiated the mass-adoption of cell phones.

At the same time, American <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison\">women are dying during or after pregnancy</a> at higher rates than in any other high-income country.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, many U.S. health care providers and policymakers are <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases/report-enhancing-maternal-health-initiative\">looking for ways to improve maternal care</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We believe <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-does-a-birth-doula-do-202311222995\">doulas</a> – care workers who provide nonmedical support before and during pregnancy, labor, birth and the postpartum period – may be a part of the solution.</p>\n\n<p>We are a <a href=\"https://obgyn.ufl.edu/profile/louis-jacques-adetola/\">physician-researcher</a> specializing in high-risk pregnancies and breastfeeding and a <a href=\"https://soccrim.clas.ufl.edu/directory/students/seun-ajoseh/\">Ph.D. candidate in sociology</a> focused on reproductive health and health care disparities. </p>\n\n<p>As hospitals adopt <a href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Documents/24-746-Doula-Guidance-for-Hosps.pdf\">more favorable policies</a> and <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/current-state-doula-medicaid-efforts/\">states expand insurance coverage for doula services</a>, doulas are becoming <a href=\"https://madriella.org/the-doula-boom-how-policy-shifts-and-public-demand-are-fueling-a-new-era-of-empowerment/\">part of the mainstream U.S. maternal health system</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>But there are still significant barriers to access, including awareness, costs and challenges to full partnership with doulas in hospitals.</p>\n\n<h2>What a doula offers</h2>\n\n<p>Pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2014.12.005\">vulnerable times</a>, and many parents-to-be and new parents find it can be difficult to navigate. Doulas advocate for their clients, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2024.01.003\">helping them voice what they need</a>. They can also help address <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2022.08.007\">mistreatment and guide them to appropriate resources</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Doulas do not perform clinical tasks, such as giving medical advice, making medical decisions, providing prescriptions or delivering babies. Rather, they provide nonmedical support. This will look different depending on the type of doula parents hire.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newhopefertility.com/blog/what-is-a-fertility-doula-guest-feature/\">Fertility doulas</a> assist people who are trying to get pregnant. They offer emotional support throughout the fertility journey, complementing the medical care, diagnostics and interventions provided by fertility doctors.</p>\n\n<p>During pregnancy and labor, birth doulas help their clients <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmhs.2025.100077\">identify normal symptoms</a> and those that may be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmhs.2025.100077\">urgent warning signs</a>. They also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2005.01.002\">provide labor support</a>, such as positioning and breathing assistance, massage, words of encouragement, coaching, education, continuous presence and other forms of comfort. They offer direct emotional support through the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmhs.2025.100077\">validation of clients’ experiences and emotions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Postpartum doulas offer extended support to new parents and infants in the immediate days, weeks or months after delivery. They educate parents and act as a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmhs.2025.100077\">bridge to mental health services</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-025-07855-y\">additional resources</a> such as diapers, feeding support and housing needs. They may help with supporting a new mom’s infant feeding goals, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01002.x\">integrating the infant into the family</a>, sibling care and processing their births.</p>\n\n<p>Full-spectrum doulas offer support throughout pregnancy, delivery and up to six months after birth. Still others offer bereavement services for parents experiencing pregnancy loss, such as abortion, miscarriage and stillbirth.</p>\n\n<p>This sort of holistic care can be invaluable, even for women with access to good medical care. Several months ago, one of us (Adetola) helped a patient find a postpartum doula. She was an educated woman with insurance and access to top medical care. She was suffering the effects of postpartum depression and anxiety despite all the therapy and medical resources offered.</p>\n\n<p>She later wrote that, for her, “the support of my postpartum doula was invaluable in my recovery. My doula provided me with the support I needed in caring for my baby for me to care for myself. Not only did she care for my baby for me to rest, but she helped me with breastfeeding.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman kneels in front of another woman breastfeeding a baby\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704945/original/file-20251126-56-3uushy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">During the postpartum period, doulas support new mothers in feeding their newborns.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/nurse-doula-accompanying-breastfeeding-royalty-free-image/1389331341?phrase=doula&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">Igor Alecsander/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Doula training</h2>\n\n<p>As of August 2025, <a href=\"https://www.poidata.io/report/doula/united-states\">there were 2,232 registered doula businesses</a> in the U.S. California has the highest concentration at 7.5%, while West Virginia has the lowest concentration, 0.1%. These numbers may not reflect hospital-based or nonprofit-affiliated doulas, or those not formally registered.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., more than 100 independent organizations provide doula training. Some of the larger organizations include <a href=\"https://www.dona.org/\">DONA International</a>, <a href=\"https://childbirthinternational.com/\">Childbirth International</a> and the <a href=\"https://cappa.net/\">Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association</a>. Doula training typically covers <a href=\"https://childbirthinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Birth-Doula-Syllabus-1.pdf\">communication and advocacy skills</a>, stages of labor and birth, and postpartum support. It also includes coursework on how to build a business as well as infection prevention and control.</p>\n\n<p>Some organizations provide online or in-person courses, and doula training can also be done through apprenticeships. While certifications or licenses are not required to practice, various state Medicaid programs mandate training and certification <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/doula-medicaid-training-and-certification-requirements-summary-of-current-state-approaches-and-recommendations-for-improvement/\">to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Better outcomes with doula support</h2>\n\n<p>The services that doulas offer can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114296\">complement the more mainstream biomedical approach</a> of many doctors and nurses.</p>\n\n<p>Maternal health outcomes in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison\">have been worsening for decades</a> in comparison to other high-income countries. </p>\n\n<p>But studies show that a doula-clinician partnership improves key components of maternal health care, such as better <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-024-00682-w\">communication and patient-centered care</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2023.100259\">accountability in the health care team</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2024.03.001\">continuity of support for mothers</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Having a doula present in the lead-up to delivery, at the delivery or both is associated with lower rates of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101531\">cesarean deliveries</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-017-2402-0\">preterm births</a> and fewer <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.22.1.49\">low-birthweight infants</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Doula support is also associated with improved <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-018-2537-7\">childbirth education attendance</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(98)00430-x\">birth satisfaction</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000005465\">self-efficacy and confidence</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15568253251367430\">breastfeeding experiences and outcomes</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-018-2537-7\">positive infant-care behaviors</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>After birth, infants born with a doula present have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003766.pub6\">higher five-minute Apgar scores</a>, an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003402.htm\">assessment of infant health</a> taken exactly five minutes after birth. Parents who received doula support have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101531\">reduced rates of postpartum depression and anxiety</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Doula support has also been shown <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2016.03.150300\">to help close</a> <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/womens-health/features/maternal-mortality.html\">maternal outcome gaps</a>, particularly those rooted in <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dfcd768f1caf6fabf3d281f762e8d068/ASPE-Doula-Issue-Brief-12-13-22.pdf\">racial, socioeconomic</a> and <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2025/06001/effect_of_doula_care_on_social_determinants_of.58.aspx?context=latestarticles\">institutional barriers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And beyond all the health benefits for parents and infants, research shows that doulas can reduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12218\">health care costs associated with having a baby</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh3Jy5T_exE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Some hospitals provide doulas to all of their pregnant and postpartum patients.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Funding sources for doula support</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, despite all of these benefits, many U.S. families struggle to afford doula care. Private insurance <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/private-insurance-coverage-of-doula-care-a-growing-movement-to-expand-access-2/\">does not typically cover doula services</a>. Clients can pay out of pocket using a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010817\">flat-rate service charge, fee-for-service or monthly stipend model</a>. They can also pay for these services using extended benefits such as flex or health savings accounts.</p>\n\n<p>The cost <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-01-22-BixbyNHeLP-Cost-Benefit-Analysis-of-Doula-Care.pdf\">varies by state and region</a>, experience level and service package. Out-of-pocket costs for comprehensive birth doula services can <a href=\"https://blog.imodstyle.com/how-much-does-a-doula-charge-a-complete-cost-breakdown/\">range from US$800</a> <a href=\"https://www.partumhealth.com/resources/how-much-does-a-doula-cost\">to more than $3,000</a> across the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>As of September 2025, <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/current-state-doula-medicaid-efforts/\">23 states plus Washington, D.C.</a>, were actively reimbursing Medicaid coverage for doula care.</p>\n\n<p>Only two states – <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/private-insurance-coverage-of-doula-care-spring-2024-state-of-the-states/\">Rhode Island and Louisiana</a> – currently require that private health plans cover doula care. However, Colorado, Virginia, Illinois and Delaware are in the process of implementing doula coverage in <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/private-insurance-coverage-of-doula-care-spring-2024-state-of-the-states/\">private health plans</a>. <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/private-insurance-coverage-of-doula-care-spring-2024-state-of-the-states/\">More states are expected</a> to continue efforts to require doula coverage for private health plans.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ancientsongdoulaservices.com/\">Some community-based organizations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.healthystartflorida.com/programs/healthy-start-doula/\">nonprofits</a> provide free or low-cost doula care through grants or donations. These programs usually prioritize low-income families. In New York City, free or low-cost doula support is available through the <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/citywide-doula-initiative.page\">Citywide Doula Initiative</a> which serves Medicaid-eligible families, teen parents and residents of priority neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, some hospitals and birth centers employ doulas or work with them as part of their maternal care teams. </p>\n\n<h2>Finding a doula</h2>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.dona.org/what-is-a-doula-2/how-to-hire-a-doula/\">hiring a doula</a>, you’ll want to consider their training, certifications and experience. You will also want to know how available they are, what services they offer and their fees and payment methods. </p>\n\n<p>In addition:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Consider asking your health care provider or hospital for recommendations for doulas in the community. </li>\n<li>Look into doula directories, such as <a href=\"https://www.dona.org/what-is-a-doula-2/find-a-doula/\">DONA International</a>, <a href=\"https://doulamatch.net/\">DoulaMatch.net</a>, <a href=\"https://cappa.net/directory/\">CAPPA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.blackdoulas.life/\">National Black Doulas Association</a>. Also, check to see whether your state has a doula directory, like those in <a href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/doula-directory.aspx\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.health.state.mn.us/facilities/providers/doula/index.html\">Minnesota</a> <a href=\"https://ordoulas.org/directory?&amp;tab=1\">Oregon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/keep-mi-healthy/maternal-and-infant-health/mdhhs-doula-initiative/mdhhs-doula-registry\">Michigan</a>.</li>\n<li>Ask for recommendations from friends, family or local parenting groups.</li>\n<li>Check local community boards, birth centers and drugstores for any doula advertisements.</li>\n<li>You might also connect with doulas at birth or parenting classes.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253903/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adetola F.

That’s a departure from fundamental constitutional protections in the U.S. that provide the right to a hearing before indefinite imprisonment. </p>\n\n<p>In response, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/28/trump-detention-deportation-policy-00669861\">federal judges are systematically rejecting</a> the Trump administration’s attempt to drastically expand who can be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-orders-trump-administration-provide-bond-hearings-detained-migrants-2025-11-25/\">locked up without a hearing</a> while awaiting deportation proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump White House policy has been challenged in at least 362 cases in federal district courts, according to a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.647311/gov.uscourts.nysd.647311.28.0.pdf\">recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan</a>. Challengers have prevailed in 350 of those cases – decided by over 160 different judges sitting in about 50 different courts across the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Behind those numbers are thousands of people whose freedom hangs in the balance while courts decide whether their imprisonment is lawful.</p>\n\n<p>Trump administration officials claim they are targeting only “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/immigrants-detained-denied-bond-ice-self-deportation-rcna237505\">the worst of the worst</a>” in immigration enforcement. Yet <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/new-data-prove-dhs-lied-about-cato-report-ice\">nearly three-quarters of people detained</a> had no criminal history at all. Of those with criminal histories, many involved only minor offenses such as traffic violations.  </p>\n\n<p>The immigrants are in civil immigration proceedings to determine whether they can remain in the United States. Yet under the administration’s new policy, many are being held in <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-immigrant-detention\">jail-like facilities indefinitely</a>, including “state-run prisons located in remote areas, soft-sided tent structures, military bases, and even in prisons in other countries,” according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute think tank.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70rnLI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a law professor</a> who studies due process in immigration proceedings, I view the overwhelming judicial consensus against this policy as the federal courts performing their essential constitutional function: checking executive overreach.

The new interpretation extends it to anyone present in the U.S. illegally. That includes people who entered years or decades ago, have established families and businesses and are pursuing legal pathways to remain in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The practical effect of the change is that people who were previously entitled to request release on bond while their deportation cases proceeded are now subject to automatic, indefinite detention without court review of whether their imprisonment is justified.</p>\n\n<h2>Courts overwhelmed by petitions</h2>\n\n<p>Within months of the July policy announcement, <a href=\"https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/federal-lawsuits-challenging-immigration-detention-flood-texas\">more than 700</a> emergency habeas petitions – legal challenges to unlawful imprisonment – reached federal courts nationwide. </p>\n\n<p>In Michigan alone, U.S. District Judge Hala Jarbou – a Trump appointee – <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/28/trump-detention-deportation-policy-00669861\">received more than 100 individual cases</a> from detainees challenging their imprisonment. Then, 97 additional detainees filed a joint lawsuit. Cases arose across the country as immigrants who were arrested at workplaces, courthouses or during <a href=\"https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/195-the-immigration-detention-flood\">routine check-ins with immigration officers</a> asked federal courts to order their release or grant them bond hearings.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has fought these cases on multiple fronts. It has argued that the detention policy is lawful and that federal courts <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.447617/gov.uscourts.flmd.447617.31.0.pdf\">lack jurisdiction to review it at all</a>.

They have found that courts retain the power to review whether detentions comply with the Constitution and federal law.</p>\n\n<p>As one district court judge explained, accepting the government’s position would mean the executive branch could detain noncitizens indefinitely without ever having to justify that detention to a court. It’s a result that would raise “<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.447617/gov.uscourts.flmd.447617.31.0.pdf\">serious constitutional concerns</a>” about suspending habeas corpus, the fundamental right to challenge unlawful imprisonment.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.647311/gov.uscourts.nysd.647311.28.0.pdf\">Judge Kaplan similarly concluded</a> that the “current administration’s unilateral decision that all noncitizens … are to be mandatorily detained affords to such individuals no process, let alone due process. It is unconstitutional.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UttF0CdYXNU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">An explanation on what “due process” means.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The policy’s ripple effects extend beyond the courts. </p>\n\n<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained a record <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ices-detainee-population-reaches-66000-a-new-record-high-statistics-show/\">66,000 people</a> in November 2025 – more than any previous administration had ever held at one time. The American Immigration Council, which advocates for immigration rights, documented <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/trump-deadlier-for-ice-detainees-than-covid-19-pandemic/\">23 deaths in ICE detention</a> during fiscal year 2025. The previous four years combined saw 24 such deaths.</p>\n\n<h2>A nationwide remedy</h2>\n\n<p>The piecemeal nature of hundreds of individual court rulings creates its own problems. Each emergency petition requires rushed briefing and a hearing. That strains the courts and detained immigrants’ ability to secure representation. Outcomes can vary based on which judge hears a case, creating geographic disparities in who remains detained and who is released.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why the November decision in <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70895584/lazaro-maldonado-bautista-v-ernesto-santacruz-jr/\">Maldonado Bautista v. Santacruz</a> is potentially transformative. U.S. District Judge Sunshine S. Sykes <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70895584/82/lazaro-maldonado-bautista-v-ernesto-santacruz-jr/\">certified a nationwide class of noncitizens</a> subject to the policy and separately <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/bautista-v-noem?document=Order-Granting-PSJ\">ruled that the government’s interpretation of the law was wrong</a> – detainees are entitled to bond hearings. Combined with the nationwide class certification, this ruling could require the Trump administration to provide bond hearings to thousands of people currently in mandatory detention.</p>\n\n<p>But implementation has been uneven. Immigration judges – who are <a href=\"https://www.aila.org/the-truth-about-our-immigration-court-system\">Justice Department employees</a>, not independent federal judges – have responded inconsistently to Judge Sykes’ order. </p>\n\n<p>In a recent immigration court decision in Memphis, Tenn., a <a href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-immigration-news-judges-order-could-make-thousands-arrested-immigrants-eligible-bond-hearings-release/18242722/\">judge denied a bond hearing request</a>. The judge stated that further guidance from the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir\">Executive Office for Immigration Review</a>, a Department of Justice office, was required before complying with Sykes’ order. </p>\n\n<p>Attorneys representing the class say they’ve seen similar resistance from some immigration judges, while others have begun granting bond hearings. They plan to return to federal court in January 2026 to present evidence of this confusion and seek further relief.</p>\n\n<p>The near-unanimous rejection by federal judges – <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-iii/clauses/45#article-iii-section-one-by-richard-garnett-and-david-strauss\">insulated from political pressure by lifetime appointments</a> – demonstrates why the Constitution grants judges life tenure. Federal courts remain the final check when executive action threatens fundamental due process rights.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271076/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Cassandra Burke Robertson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Next year, Nevada’s government will ask residents to approve <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevadans-vote-to-enshrine-abortion-rights-in-constitution-but-it-needs-approval-in-2026\">constitutional protection for abortion rights</a> for the second time, as required by state law. The same measure passed in 2024 with <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_6,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024)\">just over 64% of the vote</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Virginians will likely see a similar ballot initiative. In November 2025, voters there cemented a <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/11/04/election-2025/\">majority for Democrats in the state legislature</a>, and the House of Delegates is expected to put forth an <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/10/20/virginia-governor-election-abortion-spanberger-sears/\">abortion rights ballot measure</a> to voters in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-abortion proponents in Missouri want to undo an amendment protecting abortion rights that voters passed in 2024. They’re advancing <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2025/09/30/missouri-abortion-ban-amendment-campaign-fundraising/\">a new measure that could strip residents of the reproductive rights</a> that are now constitutionally enshrined.</p>\n\n<p>However, the most consequential questions about abortion in 2026 could be answered at the federal level, by the Trump administration or in the courts. As a scholar of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q974nRQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">reproductive health law</a>, I’m watching how federal judges and agencies respond to conservative efforts to restrict or end people’s access to mailed abortion medication.</p>\n\n<h2>Medication abortion in the courts</h2>\n\n<p>Over 25 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation\">approved mifepristone</a> – one of two drugs commonly paired together to end a pregnancy. Since that time, <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/05/23/mifepristone-misoprostol-and-abortion-medications-experts-explain-how-these-drugs-can-be-used-to-terminate-a-pregnancy/\">medication abortion</a> has been closely regulated by the FDA and is under attack.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of anti-abortion physicians, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/23-235\">sued the FDA for approving mifepristone</a> in 2000 and for each time the agency eased a restriction on mifepristone thereafter, in 2016 and 2021. The complaint argued that the FDA failed to consider evidence establishing the harm caused by medication abortion – claims roundly rejected by decades of <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/2025/10/war-mifepristone-how-junk-science-and-false-narratives-threaten-us-abortion-access\">rigorous, peer-reviewed research</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf\">Supreme Court in 2024 ruled</a> that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing to sue because FDA regulation of medication abortion caused no actual injury to the doctors it represented, who do not prescribe mifepristone or perform abortions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet the case lives on in lower federal courts. There is ongoing litigation, and politicians are taking up the fight over mailed medication abortion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5531327-mifepristone-lawsuit-transferred-missouri/\">Kansas, Missouri and Idaho</a> intervened in the Alliance lawsuit <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5617736-mifepristone-lawsuit-missouri-kansas-idaho/\">in 2023</a>, seeking to establish standing, and Louisiana sued the FDA in a separate case challenging the <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/09/fda-abortion/\">FDA’s regulation of mifepristone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The pending actions focus on the FDA’s decision in 2021 to lift the requirement that patients pick up mifepristone in person, which has permitted patients to receive medication abortion by mail. These states claim this development is dangerous and threatens their right to enforce their abortion bans.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2025, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/chelius-v-becerra?document=joint-motion-stay-case-pending-agency-review\">a federal court in Hawaii</a> came to a different conclusion. The court concluded that because mifepristone is very safe, the FDA must reconsider whether the drug necessitates any restrictions at all.</p>\n\n<h2>The politics of medication abortion</h2>\n\n<p>The dispute over medication abortion is playing out in Washington, D.C., too.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, 51 <a href=\"https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2025/10/51-republican-senators-urge-fda-to-continue-to-stand-for-life-reevaluate-generic-abortion-pill-approval\">Republican senators</a> and <a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/pdfs/mifepristoneletter081325.pdf\">22 Republican attorneys general</a> asked the FDA to reinstate the 2021 in-person restriction and upend the transit of abortion pills.</p>\n\n<p>In response to Republicans’ push to restrict or withdraw the availanlity of mifepristone, 47 <a href=\"https://www.murray.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11.06.2025-Letter-to-HHS-and-FDA-re-Mifepristone-Review-FINAL.pdf\">Democratic senators</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/attorneys-general-issue-joint-statement-affirming-safety-and-access-medical\">20 attorneys general</a> issued letters supporting mifepristone’s safety. The letters questioned <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-fda-abortion-pill-mifepristone-safety-review/\">a pledge by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> and his FDA chief to commence a “review” of the drug. The Democratic senators’ letter pressed the agency to remove all remaining restrictions on mifepristone.</p>\n\n<p>In early December, Bloomberg reported that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/fda-slow-walking-a-long-awaited-abortion-pill-safety-study\">the FDA had quietly postponed its planned mifepristone “review</a>” until after the 2026 midterm elections.</p>\n\n<h2>The battle over telehealth abortion care</h2>\n\n<p>Decades of research demonstrates that medication abortion is safe and effective. When commenced before 10 weeks’ gestation, the two-drug method <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21899-medical-abortion\">is effective about 98% of the time</a>. Complications, such as infection or hemorrhage, are rare; they occur in <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/05/23/mifepristone-misoprostol-and-abortion-medications-experts-explain-how-these-drugs-can-be-used-to-terminate-a-pregnancy/\">perhaps a fraction of a percent of all medication abortions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet courts and legislators cannot agree on basic facts, in part due to widespread disinformation about abortion care, and anti-abortion forces have waged a <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/08/28/texas-lawsuits-target-telehealth-abortion/\">concerted national campaign to stop mailed abortion pills</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, no part of the medication abortion process needs to be done in person: The patient, provider and pharmacy can all interact virtually.</p>\n\n<p>Mailed medication abortion is <a href=\"https://www.kuow.org/stories/abortion-by-mail-is-on-the-rise-even-in-states-like-washington-where-it-remains-legal\">popular nationwide</a>, <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/08/15/people-in-states-with-abortion-bans-are-the-biggest-users-of-abortion-telemedicine/\">particularly in states with abortion bans</a>. Because of mailed medication abortion, the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/abortion-trends-before-and-after-dobbs/\">average number of abortions nationwide has actually increased</a> since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, reversing abortion protections under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>Providers in <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.2070\">so-called “shield” states</a> are a key reason for this. Eight U.S. states have laws that shield providers from civil, criminal and professional consequences for delivering reproductive health care to out-of-state patients.</p>\n\n<p>In these shield states, doctors may prescribe abortion medication no matter where the patient lives, so long as that care is delivered by a provider licensed and located in the shield state, complying with the shield state’s laws.</p>\n\n<p>These laws are the subject of legal conflicts between anti-abortion states and shield states.</p>\n\n<p>Late in 2024, Texas sued a doctor in New York, a shield state, for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-doctor-maggie-carpenter-pills-847112cde026e29333c3481310593582\">violating Texas abortion and licensure laws</a>. In early 2025, Louisiana indicted the same New York physician.</p>\n\n<p>Texas won its case in a Texas court and then asked New York to enforce the judgment of more than $100,000 in fines and fees. A <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/27/new-york-texas-abortion-doctor-pills/\">New York court has refused to do so</a>, citing its shield law. New York also rejected Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor to stand trial for the same reason.</p>\n\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2025, <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB7/id/3267366\">Texas officially enacted the first bill</a> in the country that explicitly targets shield laws. <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/12/texas-abortion-pill-private-lawsuits-legal-fight/\">Passed in September 2025</a>, HB 7 allows private citizens to file lawsuits against a person or entity for attempting or intending to mail abortion pills into the state.</p>\n\n<h2>Watch the courts and the FDA</h2>\n\n<p>Having <a href=\"https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDra2200280\">written about shield laws</a> extensively, I believe these interstate conflicts will land, sooner or later, before the Supreme Court. Right now, state and federal courts are deciding the issues.</p>\n\n<p>If judges determine that shield laws are unconstitutional or that the FDA acted illegally, courts could substantially alter people’s ability to gain access to medication abortion.</p>\n\n<p>So could the FDA. If it reimposes an unnecessary restriction on mifepristone, meaning the drug would no longer be widely available through telehealth, that decision would curb how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/opinion/abortion-pills.html\">1 in 4 women in the U.S. receive abortion care</a> today.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx\">But opinion polls</a> indicate that the majority of Americans do not think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, and they vote accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2025, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5599185/2025-election-results-georgia-pennsylvania-democrats-win\">won significant elections</a>, for example, in New Jersey, Virginia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/abortion-election-state-explainer\">Pennsylvania</a>. Abortion was absent from ballots in these states this year, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/abortion-election-state-explainer\">these races</a> still <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/11/04/election-2025/\">held significance for abortion rights</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The election of a pro-choice governor and legislature in Virginia, for example, all but guarantees that abortion will continue to be legal in the last Southern state to protect broader abortion rights. Likewise, Pennsylvanians opted to keep the state supreme court’s liberal majority, which <a href=\"https://statecourtreport.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/pennsylvania-supreme-court-ruling-overturns-decades-old-precedent\">struck down</a> the state prohibition on Medicaid payment for abortion.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, two years after the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">fall of Roe v.

About <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2023-nsduh-detailed-tables\">1 in 10 smoke cigarettes</a>. For teens living in neighborhoods with high levels of disadvantage and social disorganization, the <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/Publications/pdf/Opportunity_Neighborhoods.pdf\">odds are 35% to 72% higher</a>. Disadvantaged neighborhoods generally have higher levels of economic hardship, poorer educational opportunities and limited resources. Those factors weaken the social fabric of a community.</p>\n\n<p>Although alcohol and tobacco use among adolescents <a href=\"https://monitoringthefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mtf2025.pdf\">has declined in recent years</a>, both remain the most commonly used and abused substances compared to cocaine or heroin.  Alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to substance dependence in adulthood, sexual victimization, some cancers and premature death.</p>\n\n<p>One of us – Anna Maria Santiago – <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D1jZaTAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">studies neighborhood effects, or</a> how where children and adolescents live affects their health and well-being. Iris Margetis is <a href=\"https://econ.msu.edu/about/directory/margetis-iris-grad-2020\">a Ph.D. candidate in economics</a> and co-author of the study. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Exposure to neighborhood violence <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2013.01.012\">has been thought to trigger adolescent</a> alcohol and tobacco use as a way of coping with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.06.004\">heightened levels of stress</a> associated with that exposure. However, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.08.015\">previous findings have been mixed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Seventeen percent of survey participants started smoking as teens. The average age of first use was 15.6 years. Fifteen percent started drinking as teens when they were 16.1 years old, on average. </p>\n\n<p>Greater exposure to neighborhood violence prompted teens in our study to start drinking and smoking two to eight months earlier than their peers. Girls started using both substances earlier than boys. Latino teens started earlier than African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>We controlled for other potential individual, household and neighborhood risk factors such as family size, household stressors and level of neighborhood disadvantage. The risk of starting to use alcohol still increased 32% for all teens residing in neighborhoods with greater violence. The risk of tobacco use in those neighborhoods was 1.3 to 1.5 times higher for boys, Latino and African American adolescents.</p>\n\n<h2>How we do our work</h2>\n\n<p>We analyzed administrative and survey data originally gathered from a natural experiment involving a policy change in Denver for approximately 1,100 Latino and African American teens. The teens lived in 110 census tracts across metro Denver. </p>\n\n<p>To measure exposure to violence, we used our survey data to create a neighborhood problems index that measured several factors. Those included the presence of people selling drugs, gang activity, homes broken into by burglars, people being robbed or mugged, people getting beaten or raped, and children and youth getting into trouble. We defined the presence of three or more of these as high exposure to neighborhood violence.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>We still don’t know what community interventions work best. But research suggests that caregiver and community-level action is crucial. According to study participants, caregivers monitored their adolescents closely. They limited unsupervised time outside or with friends, especially in neighborhoods with higher exposure to violence. </p>\n\n<p>Study findings suggest that neighborhood youth clubs, sports teams, community centers and parks may serve as powerful deterrents to substance use initiation among teens. Community-led, evidence-based programs such as <a href=\"https://www.riseaboveco.org/\">Rise Above Colorado</a> support efforts promoting positive youth development and fostering positive community norms as prevention and early intervention strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The state of Colorado says preventing or delaying initiation of both alcohol and tobacco use <a href=\"https://cdphe.colorado.gov/youth\">remain key public health goals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, additional work is needed to develop programming and activities that facilitate these efforts in Latino and African American communities. </p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270412/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Anna Maria Santiago previously received funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; the John D. and Catherine T.

Manufacturers like Apple and Dell, as well as mobile service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon, offer their own options for customers to buy used items. Their sales rely on the availability of a <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/the-enormous-opportunity-of-e-waste-recycling/\">large volume of used products</a>, which are supplied by the emergence of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/second-hand-electronic-products-market-090000899.html\">an entire line of businesses</a> that process used, discarded or returned electronics.</p>\n\n<p>Those developments are some of the results of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.0444\">widespread innovations across the electronics industry</a> that supply chain researcher <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/suresh/\">Suresh Muthulingam</a> and <a href=\"https://sites.gatech.edu/suvrat/\">I</a> have linked to <a href=\"https://calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/statutes/\">California’s Electronic Waste Recycling Act</a>, passed in 2003.</p>\n\n<h2>Recycling innovation</h2>\n\n<p>Originally intended to reduce the amount of electronic waste flowing into the state’s landfills, California’s law did far more, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.0444\">unleashing a wave of innovation</a>, our analysis found. </p>\n\n<p>We analyzed the patent-filing activity of hundreds of electronics firms over a 17-year time span from 1996 to 2012. We found that the passage of California’s law not only prompted electronics manufacturers to engage in sustainability-focused innovation, but it also sparked a surge in general innovation around products, processes and techniques. </p>\n\n<p>Faced with new regulations, electronics manufacturers and suppliers didn’t just make small adjustments, such as tweaking their packaging to ensure compliance. They fundamentally rethought their design and manufacturing processes, to create products that use recycled materials and that are easily recyclable themselves. </p>\n\n<p>For example, Samsung’s <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-galaxy-s25-receives-2025-rema-design-for-recycling-award\">Galaxy S25</a> smartphone is a new product that, when released in May 2025, was made of eight different recycled materials, including aluminum, neodymium, steel, plastics and fiber.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with advanced recycling technologies and processes, these materials can be recovered and reused several times in new devices and products. For example, Apple invented the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrTd3VKLSrz/?hl=en\">Daisy Robot</a>, which disassembles old iPhones in a matter of seconds and recovers a variety of precious metals, including copper and gold. These materials, which would otherwise have to be mined from rock, are reused in Apple’s manufacturing process for new iPhones and iPads.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>How do consumers benefit?</h2>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C. have passed laws requiring <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/electronics-batteries-management/regulations-electronics-stewardship\">electronics recycling and refurbishing</a>, the process of restoring a pre-owned electronic device so that it can function like new.</p>\n\n<p>The establishment of <a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-establishes-industry-standard-for-grading-pre-owned-wireless-devices\">industry guidelines and standards</a> also means that all pre-owned devices are thoroughly tested for functionality and cosmetic appearance before resale. </p>\n\n<p>Companies’ deeper engagement with innovation appears to have created organizational momentum that carried over into other areas of product development. For example, in our study, we found that the passage of California’s law directly resulted in a flurry of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.0444\">patents related to semiconductor materials, data storage and battery technology</a>, among others. These scientific advances have made devices more durable, repairable and recyclable.</p>\n\n<p>For the average consumer, the recycling laws and the resulting industry responses mean used electronics are available with similar reliability, warranties and return policies as new devices – and <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/us-refurbished-and-used-mobile-phones-market\">at prices as much as 50% lower</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270347/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Suvrat Dhanorkar does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Now, a year after that conflict ended with the <a href=\"https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2025/05/07/the-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-winners-losers-and-challenges-ahead/\">fall of the Assad regime</a> in December 2024, many in Germany – including the country’s leader – want those same Syrians gone.</p>\n\n<p>In November, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced a controversial plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/04/friedrich-merz-syrians-no-reason-asylum-germany\">deport Syrian refugees</a> “in the near future.” He also urged the <a href=\"https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/61640/syrians-in-germany-facts-figures-and-data\">1 million Syrians in Germany</a>, most of whom are Muslim, to voluntarily return. </p>\n\n<p>This hardened stance toward Syrian refugees, expressed at the highest level of government, has been interpreted as Merz’s attempt to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl\">stave off</a> Germany’s rising far-right party, the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/25785648.2022.2069337\">Alternative for Germany (AfD)</a>. In the <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-results-explained-in-graphics/a-71724186\">February 2025 national election</a>, the AfD won almost 21% of the vote, making it the second-largest party in the parliament. The government’s perceived rationale is that in getting tough on immigration, Merz will steal some of the thunder on an issue that has seen the AfD swell its support.</p>\n\n<p>However, the reality is more complex. Racism and Islamophobia are not purely far-right phenomena. Rather, they have been part of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foreign-in-two-homelands/4870EABAF5DF7793FC782685D792DAAA\">mainstream German politics and society</a> for decades.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://history.richmond.edu/faculty/mkahn/\">expert in German migration history and far-right extremism</a>, I have studied the history of racism and Islamophobia in Merz’s own party, the centrist Christian Democratic Union (CDU). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009486682\">My recent book</a> explains how the CDU used similar tactics during the 1980s to kick out another group of predominantly Muslim migrants: Turks, who are Germany’s largest ethnic minority.</p>\n\n<h2>Paying Syrians to leave</h2>\n\n<p>Since Bashar Assad’s regime <a href=\"https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2025/05/07/the-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-winners-losers-and-challenges-ahead/\">was toppled</a> on Dec. 8, 2024, nearly <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hope-and-hardship-have-driven-syrian-refugee-returns-but-many-head-back-to-destroyed-homes-land-disputes-269555\">1.5 million externally displaced Syrians</a> have voluntarily returned to their home country. That number comprises about one-quarter of all those who have fled since Syria’s civil war began in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>However, Syrian refugees in Germany have been reluctant to return. Many have <a href=\"https://www.bosch-stiftung.de/en/storys/debatte-rueckkehr-syrischer-gefluechteter\">integrated into German society</a>.

As of December 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/press-releases/unhcr-historic-return-displaced-syrians-presents-opportunity-and-urgent\">United Nations Refugee Agency</a> still stresses that refugees should not be forced to return to Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/62319/germany-financial-incentives-offered-to-syrians-to-return-home\">official German program</a> that facilitates the voluntary return of Syrians has been in effect since January 2025.</p>\n\n<p>To persuade Syrians to leave, Germany is now offering to pay them. Since January, Syrian refugees in Germany have been able to apply online for <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250424-germany-offers-syrians-up-to-4555-to-return-home/\">up to US$4,650 (4,000 Euros)</a> per family to assist their voluntary return. The financial incentives are facilitated through the German government’s <a href=\"https://iom-p-we-webapp-ger-rfg-002.azurewebsites.net/en/news/das-bamf-informiert-aufnahme-des-zielstaats-syrien-in-das-reag-garp-2-0-programm/\">official program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other European countries, along with the <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/voluntary-return-overview-july-2025/488028edbf\">European Union</a> and the <a href=\"https://help.unhcr.org/syria/where-to-find-help/cash-assistance/cash-for-returnees/\">U.N. Refugee Agency</a>, are also offering Syrians financial incentives. A similar German policy applies to <a href=\"https://www.returningfromgermany.de/en/programmes/reag-garp/\">other migrant nationalities</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A destroyed homeland</h2>\n\n<p>Germany’s repatriation schemes have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2AoOEYaG2I\">come under severe criticism</a> from leading human rights organizations like <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2024/12/europe-safety-of-syrians-in-europe-must-not-be-sacrificed-to-political-interests/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/10/many-syrian-refugees-return-home-others-cannot\">Human Rights Watch</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, critics say, the money is far too meager to restart one’s life in Syria. Financial incentives can help with reintegration, but only if they are “robust and durable,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/post-assad-returns-syria\">Migration Policy Institute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, two-thirds of people in Syria are <a href=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/where/middle-east-and-northern-africa/syria_en\">dependent on humanitarian aid</a>. Over 7 million remain <a href=\"https://www.internal-displacement.org/countries/syria/\">internally displaced</a>, and many Syrians do not have <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/syrias-returnees-live-in-tents-atop-ruins/a-72624832\">electricity, water, sanitation or medical supplies</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Many people’s homes there are destroyed or mired in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hope-and-hardship-have-driven-syrian-refugee-returns-but-many-head-back-to-destroyed-homes-land-disputes-269555\">land disputes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Syrian <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/04/german-syrian-activist-urges-berlin-to-retain-asylum-among-ongoing-persecution-fears\">human rights activists</a> have also argued that the country remains unsafe for religious minorities, women and queer people.</p>\n\n<p>Even German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/04/friedrich-merz-syrians-no-reason-asylum-germany\">softened his stance</a> after a visit to Damascus on Oct. 30. “Here, hardly anyone can live a dignified life,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2>Turks in the 1980s: A similar policy</h2>\n\n<p>This is not the first time Germany has attempted to pay migrants to leave. In the 1980s, Merz’s party, the CDU, implemented a similar policy against Turkish migrants.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of Turks came to West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. The government formally recruited them as <a href=\"https://utppublishing.com/doi/book/10.3138/9781487521929\">guest workers</a> to help rebuild Germany after World War II.</p>\n\n<p>By the late 1970s, they increasingly brought their <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-the-family-9780197558416\">spouses and children</a>, becoming Germany’s largest ethnic minority.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foreign-in-two-homelands/4870EABAF5DF7793FC782685D792DAAA\">racism and Islamophobia</a> skyrocketed in 1980s Germany — both on the far right and in the center. </p>\n\n<p>While neo-Nazis violently attacked Turks, Germans on all sides of the political spectrum argued that Islam was incompatible with Europe. It is a view that 40 years on is being echoed by politicians on the right both in Europe and in the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-warns-europe-faces-civilizational-erasure/\">Trump administration</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A group of people load luggage onto the back of a truck.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=561&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=561&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707523/original/file-20251209-56-jruk3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=561&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Turkish guest workers in West Germany pack up ahead of heading to their homeland in 1984.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/t%C3%BCrkische-gastarbeiter-die-in-ihreheimat-zur%C3%BCchkehren-beim-news-photo/542348461?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Henning Christoph/ullstein bild via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Kicking out the Turks</h2>\n\n<p>In that racist climate, then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who led the centrist CDU from 1982 to 1998, expressed his desire to <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/secret-minutes-chancellor-kohl-wanted-half-of-turks-out-of-germany-a-914376.html\">reduce the Turkish immigrant population by 50%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But kicking out half of West Germany’s Turkish population was no easy feat — especially given the sensitivities that still plagued a country scarred by Nazi atrocities and the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/introduction-to-the-holocaust\">genocide of European Jews</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the post-war years, West Germany was desperate to reestablish its reputation as a liberal democracy <a href=\"https://www.pennpress.org/9780812244489/the-language-of-human-rights-in-west-germany/\">committed to human rights</a>. As such, forced deportations were not an option.</p>\n\n<p>Kohl’s solution, a precursor to Merz’s, was to pay Turks to leave. In 1983, West Germany passed the controversial remigration law, which offered Turks financial incentives to voluntarily return.</p>\n\n<p>The 1983 law was <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foreign-in-two-homelands/4870EABAF5DF7793FC782685D792DAAA\">widely criticized</a> by rights activists as a “kicking out policy.”</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foreign-in-two-homelands/4870EABAF5DF7793FC782685D792DAAA\">15% of Turkish migrants</a> — approximately 250,000 men, women and children — took the money and left. It was one of the largest and fastest mass remigrations in modern European history.</p>\n\n<p>However, returnees often faced financial and social hardship in Turkey. They struggled to reintegrate into the nation’s then-flailing economy. Many, especially children, were ostracized as “<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/foreign-in-two-homelands/4870EABAF5DF7793FC782685D792DAAA\">Germanized Turks</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>As the Turkish case shows, even a voluntary return is not always a happy homecoming.</p>\n\n<h2>Will Germany deport Syrians?</h2>\n\n<p>Germany today cannot realistically expect large numbers of Syrian refugees to accept the financial incentives. Amid the still ongoing humanitarian crisis in their home country, they would face <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/post-assad-returns-syria\">far more dire hardships</a> than Turks did in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, only about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl#:%7E:text=Germany%20has%20so%20far%20only,according%20to%20Germany's%20interior%20ministry.\">1,300 Syrians</a> in Germany have voluntarily returned since Assad’s regime collapsed last year. That is just 0.1% of Germany’s Syrian population.</p>\n\n<p>Merz has already announced that if Syrians refuse to leave, Germany <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-friedrich-merz-afd-politics-syrians-civil-war-refugees/\">will begin deporting</a> some of them. He recently invited Syria’s president to Germany to discuss deporting Syrians <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/merz-invites-syrian-president-germany-discuss-deportations-2025-11-03/\">with criminal records</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries have already begun deportations of Syrian nationals, including <a href=\"https://unifil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/n2405583.pdf\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/syrians-in-turkey-face-deportation-into-an-unknown-future/a-69491855\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/10/02/i-have-no-idea-why-they-sent-us-back/jordanian-deportations-and-expulsions-syrian\">Jordan</a>, the countries where most Syrian refugees are located.</p>\n\n<p>Merz is, of course, responding to real political dynamics in Germany. The far right is indeed rising, which the center has responded to by moving further right. And as such, the fact that Merz’s party is cracking down on migration should not come as a surprise.</p>\n\n<p>But today, as in the past, the response risks pandering to racism and Islamophobia that have been <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/germany-s-far-right-drift-how-extremist-ideas-are-gaining-ground-in-the-political-center/3754732\">embedded in Germany’s mainstream</a>. And Syrians, like Turks before them, are caught in the crossfire.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271475/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michelle Lynn Kahn has received funding from the National Humanities Center, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, American Historical Association, American Jewish Archives, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.</span></em></p>",

DNA is organized into regions called genes, each of which codes for proteins that carry out different functions like repairing tissues.</p>\n\n<p>While your DNA generally stays the same throughout your life, it can sometimes collect small chemical changes called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/epigenetics\">epigenetic modifications</a>. These changes act like dimmer switches, turning genes up or down without changing the underlying code. In general, dialing up the activity of a gene increases production of the protein it codes for, while dialing down the gene decreases production of that protein.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aAhcNjmvhc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Epigenetic changes play a significant role in how your body functions and develops.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One common type of epigenetic modification is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2022.03.010\">DNA methylation</a>. DNA methylation is not fixed but can instead change in response to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-you-eat-could-alter-your-unborn-children-and-grandchildrens-genes-and-health-outcomes-221091\">what you eat</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00217-0\">how you move your body</a> or even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09299-y\">how stressed you are</a>. We wondered if these epigenetic changes might also change in response to brain injury in children.</p>\n\n<h2>Epigenetic changes in traumatic brain injury</h2>\n\n<p>To explore this idea, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00460\">enrolled nearly 300 children</a> at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh in our study. Of these children, 189 had a traumatic brain injury serious enough to require at least one night in the hospital, while the others had broken bones but no head injury. </p>\n\n<p>We collected blood samples while they were in the hospital, and again at six and 12 months after their injury. We then measured DNA methylation in a gene called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105078\">brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<em>BDNF</em>)</a>, which plays a role in how the brain develops and repairs. </p>\n\n<p>Within approximately 30 hours of injury, children with traumatic brain injury had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">lower levels DNA methylation</a> than children without brain injury. Interestingly, these differences were not connected to how severe the child’s injury appeared based on tests that health care teams use in the clinic, such as brain scans or evaluations of consciousness. This suggests that two children who look very similar to the eye may be responding to their injury differently at the cellular and epigenetic level.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings also suggest that DNA methylation could help researchers understand something completely new about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">brain’s response to injury</a> that existing clinical tools cannot detect. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor looking at panel of brain scans.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Brain scans don’t show what’s happening at the cellular and genetic level.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-female-doctor-examine-mri-picture-royalty-free-image/1224190214\">mady70/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Improving recovery after traumatic brain injury</h2>\n\n<p>When a child comes to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury, health care teams can assess the injury based on what it looks like and how the child is currently handling symptoms. But they cannot necessarily determine how a child’s body is responding to their injury, or what other factors put them at risk for poor recovery. That gap makes it difficult to predict which children may later experience <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27080734/\">problems with thinking, attention or behavior</a>. Because the brains of children are still developing, early injuries can disrupt development and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.51195\">lead to long-term cognitive or behavioral issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings indicate that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">epigenetic signals like DNA methylation</a> might help clinicians and researchers develop more effective treatment strategies. While it’s still unclear whether these epigenetic changes influence children’s cognitive function after injury, further research could enable DNA methylation to offer a more precise guide to rehabilitation. In fact, our team is currently examining how <a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/1djDWFDVoEiQmU-lrOwRNw/project-details/11087693\">DNA methylation patterns across all genes</a> affect long-term outcomes in children with traumatic brain injury.</p>\n\n<p>Pairing what clinicians can observe at the bedside with information at the cellular and epigenetic level can bring medicine one step closer to individualized care plans matching children with treatments that can most effectively help them heal.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271453/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lacey W.

Though politicians may tout new opportunities to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/climate/trump-offshore-drilling-leases.html\">drill offshore</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-finalizes-plan-to-open-pristine-alaska-wildlife-refuge-to-drilling\">Arctic Alaska</a>, the commercial payoff is not clear and even unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>Having worked in and <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/expert/harold-skip-york\">studied the energy industry for decades</a>, I’ve seen a number of discoveries that companies struggled to moved forward with because either the discovery was not large enough to be commercially profitable or the geology was too difficult to make development plausible. Market conditions are the prime drivers of U.S. energy investment – not moves by politicians seeking to seem supportive of the industry.</p>\n\n<h2>Market fundamentals trump policy announcements</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=RWTC&amp;f=W\">general decline in oil prices</a> from 2022 through late 2025 has reduced the attractiveness of many drilling investments. </p>\n\n<p>And opening the East and West coasts to drilling may sound significant, but these regions have <a href=\"https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/resource-evaluation/2021-assessment-undiscovered-oil-and-gas-resources-nations-outer\">unconfirmed reserves</a>. That means a lot of subsurface work, such as seismic surveys, stratigraphic mapping and reservoir characterization – potentially taking years – would need to be done before any drilling would begin.</p>\n\n<p>Offshore drilling also faces enormous opposition. </p>\n\n<p>On the West Coast, California Gov. <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/11/20/governor-newsom-issues-statement-on-trumps-idiotic-offshore-oil-drilling-proposal\">Gavin Newsom</a> and California Attorney General <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/california-not-your-playground-attorney-general-bonta-condemns-trump\">Rob Bonta</a> have made forceful statements against any new California offshore oil drilling. They have said any effort is economically unnecessary, environmentally reckless and “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/climate/offshore-drilling-california-trump-newsom.html\">dead on arrival</a>” politically in the state.</p>\n\n<p>California local governments, environmental groups, business alliances and coastal communities also oppose drilling and have <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/california-offshore-drilling-newsom-trump/3807191/\">vowed to use legal and political tools</a> to block them.</p>\n\n<p>There is opposition on the East Coast, too. More than <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/press-release/offshore-drilling-plan-leaves-out-atlantic-proposes-leases-in-gulf/\">250 East Coast local governments</a> have passed resolutions against drilling.</p>\n\n<p>Governors on both sides of the aisle, including Democrat <a href=\"https://governor.nc.gov/june-16-2025-letter-governor-stein-and-governor-mcmaster-re-maintaining-trump-moratorium-offshore\">Josh Stein of North Carolina</a> and Republicans <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/kemp-discusses-environment-deal-legacy/article_fc0854fc-bfd5-5bc4-aa03-10830ba9d9e9.html\">Brian Kemp of Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/south-carolina-gov-henry-mcmaster-wants-offshore-no-drill-oil/article_b4162f12-f614-11e7-b5bc-1b205b230114.html\">Henry McMaster of South Carolina</a>, have spoken out against drilling off their coasts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arctic drilling is even harder</h2>\n\n<p>Drilling for oil and gas in the <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/congress-axes-biden-anwr-drilling-limits/\">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> and the Beaufort Sea off Prudhoe Bay in Alaska would be a massive undertaking. These projects require years of development and are subject to future reversals in federal policy – just as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5584883/trump-alaska-wildlife-refuge-oil-gas-drilling\">Trump has lifted long-standing drilling bans</a> in those areas, at least for now.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Alaska is one of the <a href=\"https://digital.akbizmag.com/issue/june-2021/is-alaska-oil-measuring-up/\">most expensive</a> and technically challenging places to drill. Specialized equipment, infrastructure for frozen landscapes, and risk mitigation for <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=AK\">extreme weather</a> drive costs far above other regions. These projects also face logistical challenges, such as pipelines running hundreds of miles through remote, icy terrain.</p>\n\n<p>Natural gas from Alaska would likely be <a href=\"https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2025/12/02/dunleavy-claims-legally-binding-south-korea-pipeline-deal-is-near-lead-lng-developer-disagrees/\">sold to Asian buyers</a>, who increasingly have <a href=\"https://www.ice.com/insights/energy/the-globalization-of-natural-gas-gains-momentum\">alternative sources of supply</a> from Australia, Canada, Qatar and even the U.S. Gulf Coast. As production rises in those places, the entrance of Alaskan natural gas into the market raises the risk for <a href=\"https://www.oilandgasadvancement.com/news/global-lng-supply-excess-could-shrink-the-prices-by-2026/\">global oversupply</a>, which could depress prices and reduce profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Despite political support from the Trump administration, the oil and gas companies would need financing to pay for the drilling. And those loans won’t come if the oil companies don’t have agreements with buyers for the petroleum products that are produced. <a href=\"https://alaskapublic.org/news/2024-05-23/shell-abandons-north-slope-oil-leases-raising-questions-about-the-industrys-future-in-alaska\">Major oil companies</a> have withdrawn from Alaska and signaled skepticism about attractive long-term returns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A close-up of a person holding a pen and signing a piece of white paper.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders seeking to boost the oil and gas industry.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-signs-one-of-five-executive-orders-news-photo/632590450\">Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Trump has helped some</h2>\n\n<p>In the first 10 months of the second Trump administration, the president has signed at least 13 <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025\">executive orders pertaining to the energy industry</a>. Most of them focus on streamlining U.S. energy regulation and removing barriers to the development and procurement of domestic energy resources. However, the broad nature of some of these orders may fall short of establishing the stable regulatory environment necessary for the development of capital-intensive energy projects with long time horizons.</p>\n\n<p>Those efforts have reversed the Biden administration’s go-slow approach to oil drilling, reducing – though not completely eliminating – the backlog of requests for <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/operations-and-production/permitting/applications-permits-drill\">onshore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.data.bsee.gov/Well/APD/Default.aspx\">offshore</a> drilling permits that accumulated during Biden’s presidency.</p>\n\n<p>Delays in permit approvals increase project costs, risk and uncertainty. Delays can increase the chances that a project ultimately is downsized – as happened with <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-substantially-reduces-scope-willow-project\">ConocoPhillips’ Willow project in Alaska</a> – or canceled altogether. Longer timelines increase financing and carrying costs, because capital is tied up without generating revenue and developers must pay interest on the debt while waiting for approvals. Delays also lead to higher project costs, eroding project economics and sometimes preventing the project from turning a profit.</p>\n\n<h2>Investment follows economics, not politics</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike in some countries, such as with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Norway’s Equinor or China’s CHN Energy, the U.S. does not have a <a href=\"https://www.nationaloilcompanydata.org/indicator\">national oil or gas company</a>. All of the major energy producers in the U.S. are privately owned and answer to shareholders, not the government. </p>\n\n<p>Executive orders or political slogans may set a tone or direction, but they cannot override the fundamental requirement for profitability. Investments can’t be mandated by presidential decree: Projects must make economic sense. Without that, whether due to low prices, high costs, uncertain demand or changing regulations, companies will not proceed.</p>\n\n<p>Even if federal policies open new areas for drilling or relieve some regulatory restrictions, companies will invest only if they see a clear path to profit over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>With most energy investments costing large amounts of money over many years, the industry likely wants a sense of policy stability from the Trump administration. That could include lowering barriers to profitable investments by <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bipartisan-house-permitting-reform-bill/760477/\">accelerating the approval process for supporting infrastructure</a>, such as transmission power lines, pipelines, storage capacity and other logistics, rather than relying on sweeping announcements that lack market traction.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270518/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Skip York does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/202/\">Supreme Court ruled</a> that students could not be discriminated against based on their immigration status. </p>\n\n<p>This ruling ensured that immigrant students could not be denied entrance to public K-12 schools. </p>\n\n<p>The caveat is that the ruling did not extend to higher education. </p>\n\n<p>In 1996, Congress approved the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/illegal_immigration_reform_and_immigration_responsibility_act\">Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act</a>, which made it harder for undocumented immigrants who are deported to reenter the U.S., among other changes to increase border security. </p>\n\n<p>This law also said that states could not provide <a href=\"https://floridacollegeaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRB-Undocumented-students.pdf\">in-state tuition</a> to undocumented students at public universities, unless they gave the same benefits to out-of-state American citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in the early 2000s, a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/06/texas-gop-in-state-tuition-undocumented-students/\">bipartisan group of Texas representatives</a> helped <a href=\"https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-dream-act-house-bill-1403\">pass a bill</a> that opened up in-state tuition to undocumented students. The bill based tuition and scholarships on <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">specific residency requirements</a>, such as graduating from high school in the state, allowing the bill to circumvent the 1996 federal law. </p>\n\n<p>Also in the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.cccco.edu/-/media/CCCCO-Website/Files/General-Counsel/x_ab-540-flyer-ada.pdf\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://open.illinois.edu/legislation-policies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"https://wsac.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2015.1079Report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Washington</a> and <a href=\"https://dreamact.info/students/in-state/new-york?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">New York</a> also passed similar legislation that allows undocumented immigrants to receive in-state tuition – and in some cases, state scholarships – at state universities.</p>\n\n<p>Even some conservative states, <a href=\"https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/8228ef9c-712a-4df8-a759-99d218c2c716/content\">such as Utah</a>, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-70/section-70-3242/\">Oklahoma and</a> <a href=\"https://ksrevisor.gov/statutes/chapters/ch76/076_007_0031a.html\">Kansas</a>, passed such legislation during the early 2000s that let undocumented immigrants pay in-state tuition at public universities and colleges.</p>\n\n<h2>The tide turns</h2>\n\n<p>But just a few years later, things began to shift.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/state/south-carolina/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">South Carolina became the first state</a> to ban undocumented students from studying at public colleges and universities altogether. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/us/14georgia.html\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04immig.html\">Alabama</a> quickly followed suit with similar bans.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, after Congress created the <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/work/daca/\">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> program to allow immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to temporarily work, study and stay in the U.S., some schools in South Carolina <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/dreams-derailed#:%7E:text=South%20Carolina%20enacted%20the%20enrollment,on%20the%20states'%20economic%20vitality.\">briefly banned DACA students</a> from attending public universities – despite the new federal law. </p>\n\n<p>The schools <a href=\"https://che.sc.gov/sites/che/files/Documents/Meetings/2019/Residency_Regional_Workshop_2019.pdf\">reversed course</a> the next year <a href=\"https://www.aclusc.org/press-releases/aclu-of-sc-challenges-state-institutions-to-comply-with-federal-guidance-on-higher-education-admission-for-immigrant-students/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">following a lawsuit</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, but still required DACA students to pay out-of-state tuition.</p>\n\n<p>Until 2015, South Carolina even denied in-state tuition for some <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/stories/splc-lawsuit-south-carolina-tuition-policy-discriminates-against-students-violates-us/\">American citizens with undocumented parents</a>. The state reversed the policy following a lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>The trend toward more restrictive policies toward undocumented students has continued during the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>In February 2025, Florida passed a law that <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/02/20/florida-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">revoked in-state tuition</a> for undocumented students. Florida <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/244/ByVersion?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">still allows</a> undocumented immigrants to enroll at public colleges and universities, as long as they pay full tuition. </p>\n\n<p>And over the summer, the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/in-state-tuition-no-longer-offered-to-some-immigrant-students-in-oklahoma/\">challenged Oklahoma’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-texas-reach-agreement-end-state-tuition-illegal-aliens\">and Texas’</a> in-state tuition policies, which had allowed all undocumented students to pay in-state tuition. </p>\n\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/texas-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">states quickly</a> <a href=\"https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/in-state-tuition-no-longer-offered-to-some-immigrant-students-in-oklahoma/\">ended their</a> policies. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/26/texas-colleges-undocumented-students-guidance/\">Texas and</a> <a href=\"https://www.uscisguide.com/education/state-legislation-supporting-immigrant-access-to-higher-education-in-oklahoma/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Oklahoma still</a> allow DACA recipients to attend public universities and pay in-state tuition rates. </p>\n\n<p>As of 2025, <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/\">22 states and Washington D.C.</a> allow undocumented students to pay <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">in-state tuition</a>. The remaining states, meanwhile, either do not have a state policy, require undocumented immigrants to pay out-of-state tuition, or bar them entirely from attending public universities. </p>\n\n<h2>A challenging environment</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, these shifts make it harder for many undocumented students to go to and stay in college. </p>\n\n<p>The price of in-state tuition at public universities varies, but it typically offers <a href=\"https://finaid.org/otheraid/stateresidency/\">in-state residents a much lower tuition</a> rate than students coming from out of state. While the average in-state tuition at public colleges <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/resources/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">costs about US$11,610</a> for the 2024-25 school year, out-of-state students paid $30,780, on average, during this same time frame. </p>\n\n<p>Undocumented students <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/undocumented-students\">do not qualify</a> for federal financial aid, so paying out-of-state tuition at a public university usually prevents immigrants from pursuing a college degree.</p>\n\n<p>Some research shows that in-state tuition policies help reduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.12.009\">undocumented college students’ dropout rates</a> by about 8%.</p>\n\n<p>In-state tuition policies also <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ875718\">increase college enrollment</a> of noncitizen Latino students by 54%.</p>\n\n<h2>A blockade for students</h2>\n\n<p>I began teaching social studies at a high school in South Carolina in 2012, soon after many of these restrictions on immigrant students were enacted. I found that many educators and students were not aware of these restrictions until students applied to colleges or sought state licenses. </p>\n\n<p>My students included DACA recipients who completed a two-year program in areas like cosmetology, only then to be told they would not be allowed to practice in the state. </p>\n\n<p>My later research focused on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15348431.2021.1995388\">DACA students who aspired to become</a> educators but had to either stop pursuing that goal or go out of state to teach. Other immigrant students I surveyed in my research said they lost motivation in the high school classroom due to the restrictions to pursue higher education.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An aerial view shows a large group of people walking together on a track.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Students stage a walkout at a high school in Charlotte, N.C., on Nov. 18, 2025, protesting Border Patrol operations targeting undocumented immigrants.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-an-aerial-view-students-stage-a-walkout-at-east-news-photo/2247309156?adppopup=true\">John Moore/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Carryover effects</h2>\n\n<p>Policies that make it easier for undocumented immigrants to attend college don’t just affect individual students and their families – they also have a positive effect on local economies. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23315024241287505\">Research from 2025</a> shows that when undocumented students can pay in-state tuition, they become more likely to have a job after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>Another study from Clemson University and the nonprofit group Hispanic Alliance found that South Carolina could be losing <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/daca-south-carolina-jobs-licensed-fields-economy/article_559ea88a-e878-11ee-b525-2b0996e72e82.html\">up to $68 million</a> a year in revenue due to the license policy for DACA recipients. </p>\n\n<p>I have known undocumented people who are aspiring doctors and teachers and moved to other states since they could not study or receive professional licenses in South Carolina. </p>\n\n<p>Restrictive education policies could mean that some of the most talented immigrant students <a href=\"https://hispanicalliancesc.com/allied4work/\">will leave</a> their respective states.

Media and political conversations often use words or terms such as “fading,” “white,” “farming,” “traditional” and “politically uniform” to describe rural communities. </p>\n\n<p>In reality, rural communities are far more varied. Getting these facts right matters because public debates, policies and resources – including money for programs – often rely on these assumptions, and misunderstandings can leave real needs neglected.</p>\n\n<p>We are rural demographers at <a href=\"https://lsu.edu/hss/sociology/people/faculty/profiles/slack_tim.php\">Louisiana State University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/shannon-monnat\">Syracuse University</a> who study the causes and consequences of well-being in rural America. Here we outline six myths about rural America – a few among many – highlighted in our recent book “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">Rural and Small-Town America: Context, Composition, and Complexities</a>.”\n</p>\n\n<h2>Myth 1: Rural America is disappearing due to depopulation</h2>\n\n<p>Many people think rural America is emptying out. The story is more complicated. It’s true that <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/rural-america-lost-population-over-past-decade-first-time-history\">from 2010 to 2020 most rural counties lost population. But about one-third grew</a>, especially those near cities or those with lakes, mountains and other natural attractions. And there have been times, like in the 1970s and 1990s, when rural populations grew faster than cities – <a href=\"https://www.nrs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/book/nc_2002_johnson_001.pdf\">periods called “rural rebounds.</a>”</p>\n\n<p>An important thing to know about rural population change is that the places defined as “rural” change over time. When a rural town grows enough, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-classifications/what-is-rural\">reclassifies it as “urban</a>.” In other words, rural America isn’t disappearing – it’s changing and sometimes urbanizing.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"hAQ2R\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hAQ2R/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 2: Most rural Americans live on farms</h2>\n\n<p>Farming is still important in many rural places, but it’s no longer the way most rural Americans make a living. Today, <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">roughly 6% of rural jobs are in agriculture</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/market-intel/the-other-paycheck-how-off-farm-income-keeps-farmers-farming\">most farm families also have members who work off-farm jobs</a>, often for access to health insurance and retirement benefits.</p>\n\n<p>A bigger source of employment in rural America is manufacturing. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/changes-in-the-us-economy-and-rural-urban-employment-disparities-20240119.html\">manufacturing plays a larger role as a share of jobs and earnings in rural areas than in cities</a>. That also means that deindustrialization – steady job losses in manufacturing over the decades – has been especially painful in rural America. Unlike large cities with lots of employers, rural communities rely on just a few. When <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tyson-foods-chicken-plant-closures-rural-manufacturing-rcna100434\">a rural plant or factory closes, the local impacts are often devastating</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The largest share of rural jobs today <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">is in service-sector work</a>, such as retail, food service, home health care and hospitality. These jobs often pay low wages, offer few benefits and have unstable hours, making it harder for many rural families to stay financially secure.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"d3usM\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/d3usM/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 3: Only white people live in rural America</h2>\n\n<p>People often picture rural America as mostly white, <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/growing-racial-diversity-rural-america-results-2020-census\">but that’s not the full story</a>. About 1 in 4 rural residents are nonwhite. Hispanic and Black people make up the largest shares, and Indigenous people have a greater portion of their population living in rural areas than any other racial group.</p>\n\n<p>Rural America is also getting more racially and ethnically diverse every year. Young people are leading that change: About <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/growing-racial-diversity-rural-america-results-2020-census\">1 in 3 rural children are nonwhite</a>. The future of rural America is racially diverse, even if popular images don’t always show it.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"2gjf2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2gjf2/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 4: Rural America is healthier than urban America</h2>\n\n<p>Many people imagine rural life as healthier than city life. But the opposite is true. <a href=\"https://surface.syr.edu/lerner/9/\">People in rural areas die younger and at higher rates</a> than people in cities. Scholars call this the “<a href=\"https://surface.syr.edu/lerner/9/\">rural mortality penalty,” and it has been widening for years</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic made the gap even larger due to <a href=\"https://egrove.olemiss.edu/jrss/vol37/iss2/3/\">higher death rates in rural communities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t just because rural areas have more older people. Rural working-age people, ages 25 to 64, are dying younger than their urban peers, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article-abstract/35/1/3/8051779\">and the gap is growing</a>. This trend is being <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">driven by nearly all major causes of death</a>. Rural residents have higher rates of early death from cancers, heart disease, COVID-19, motor vehicle crashes, suicide, alcohol misuse, diabetes, stroke and pregnancy-related complications.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"NPsq5\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NPsq5/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 5: Rural families are more traditional than urban families</h2>\n\n<p>Images of rural life often evoke households in which married couples are raising children in traditional family structures. Historically, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11237867\">rural children were more likely to live with married parents. But that’s no longer the case</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, rural children are less likely than urban children <a href=\"https://rprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clark_2024-2_FINAL.pdf\">to live with married parents</a> and are more likely to live with cohabiting unmarried parents or in the care of grandparents or other relatives. Partly as a result, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=110356\">rural child poverty rates are higher</a> than urban rates, and many <a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/halt-in-snap-benefits-will-hurt-millions-of-rural-families/2025/\">rural families rely on safety-net supports such as the food aid program SNAP</a>. Rural families are diverse, and many are economically vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"KXHUw\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KXHUw/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 6: A new ‘rural revolt’ gave Donald Trump his presidential victories</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734668/\">Many rural voters have supported Donald Trump</a>, but this didn’t happen overnight. </p>\n\n<p>For much of the 20th century, Democrats drew major support from rural areas due to the <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">party’s alignment with the working class and 100 years of single-party rule in the South</a> spanning Reconstruction to the civil rights era. </p>\n\n<p>However, social class and regional flips in voting patterns have meant rural voters have been shifting toward Republicans for nearly 50 years. The last time rural and urban residents voted within 1 percentage point  of each other was in 1976, when Georgia peanut farmer and former governor Jimmy Carter was elected.</p>\n\n<p>The partisan gap between rural and urban voters averaged 3 percentage points in the 1980s and 1990s, before growing to 10 percentage points in the 2000s and 20 percentage points in recent cycles. So, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734668/\">Trump’s support in rural America was not a new “revolt</a>” but part of a long-term trend.</p>\n\n<p>And in 2024, the key geographic story wasn’t rural voters at all – it was the sharp drop in turnout in big cities. Both candidates got fewer urban votes than in 2020, with Kamala Harris capturing over <a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/in-the-race-for-the-presidency-gop-turnout-declined-democratic-turnout-collapsed/2024/11/08/\">10 million fewer votes in major and medium-sized cities</a> than Joe Biden had four years earlier.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"8Zhxv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8Zhxv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269037/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tim Slack has received funding from the NSF, USDA, NIH, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Energy, Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon M.

The song was not a commercial success, so he focused on playing drums for a number of local bands.</p>\n\n<p>In 1970, Pendergrass was invited by Philly soul and R&amp;B singer Harold Melvin to play drums with his group, the Blue Notes. During a performance, Pendergrass sang along, leading Melvin to invite him to take over as <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk-of-fame/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">lead vocalist after John Atkins left the group</a>. The following year, <a href=\"https://www.soundofphiladelphia.com/artist/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes</a> signed a record deal with the newly created <a href=\"https://www.soundofphiladelphia.com/about/\">Philadelphia International Records</a>, forging a partnership between Pendergrass and label founders and legendary producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff that would last over a decade.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Five male musicians dressed in dark suits perform on stage in front of microphones\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Teddy Pendergrass (second from right) performs with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes at the Greek Theatre in 1973 in Los Angeles.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/soul-singer-teddy-pendergrass-performs-with-harold-melvin-news-photo/95880269\">Sherry Rayn Barnett /Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Philadelphia International’s influence was felt throughout the music industry, with Gamble and Huff producing many of the hits performed by the label’s artists. <a href=\"https://www.bmi.com/special/gamble-huff-bell\">Gamble and Huff</a> blended soul and funk with complex horn and string arrangements to create the Philly soul sound. </p>\n\n<p>This sound became key in the development of disco, smooth jazz and <a href=\"https://timeline.carnegiehall.org/genres/neo-soul\">neo-soul</a>. Slower, more intimate R&amp;B and smooth jazz also formed the foundation for the “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/what-is-quiet-storm-music/25845/\">quiet storm</a>” radio format that Pendergrass helped foster as a solo artist on stations like <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/celebrated-wdas-radio-personality-tony-brown-dies-at-75/\">WDAS in Philadelphia</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Marvin Gaye’s 1973 album “<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/music-news/getting-marvin-gaye-came-two-sexiest-songs-time-014704514.html\">Let’s Get It On</a>” was Motown’s response to the emergence of Philly Soul, and helped popularize more explicitly sensual R&amp;B and soul.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk-of-fame/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes</a> had their first No. 1 hit with 1972’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Qgh0_JF5o\">If You Don’t Know Me by Now</a>.” While on the Philadelphia International label, the group recorded four gold records between 1972 and 1976. One of their biggest hits, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIkcB8GObo\">Don’t Leave Me This Way</a>” in 1975, was not released until November 1976. It charted after R&amp;B and disco singer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUdw7V-FC_Q\">Thelma Houston’s cover</a> of the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977.</p>\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1TxrKzJe6UCDH6CBvWaxLz?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n<h2>Going solo</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.1015vibe.com/lsp/artist/bio/teddy-pendergrass/\">Pendergrass left the Blue Notes in 1976</a> after disputes with Melvin over money, but he stayed on with Philadelphia International and began a solo career.

He was selling out concerts, and legendary producer Shep Gordon recognized that the vast majority of the attendees were women. This led to Pendergrass’ “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/10/17/163095398/for-the-ladies-r-kelly-teddy-pendergrass-and-the-state-of-r-b\">Ladies Only</a>” tour in 1978, which became a template for future soul and R&amp;B tours by contemporaries like Luther Vandross and <a href=\"https://wers.org/vault-of-soul-teddy-pendergrass/\">later artists like Ginuwine</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ginuwine-jagged-edge-team-to-tour-60245/\">tours were also marketed specifically to women</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The 1979 erotic hit “Turn Off the Lights” strengthened Pendergrass’ reputation as a sex symbol. While Marvin Gaye <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-20/crimes-of-the-times-death-of-marvin-gaye\">was dealing with both financial and personal issues</a>, Pendergrass became the top performer of soul “<a href=\"https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/best_r_b_songs_of_the_70s/s1__40688097\">bedroom ballads</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Pendergrass and Gaye, along with other contemporaries like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBf6RErcQM0\">Barry White</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I3UTG1dSTc\">Minnie Riperton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyxKSEOg2iQ\">Donna Summer</a>, included more explicitly erotic themes and lyrics than earlier artists. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Gaye’s “Let’s Get it On,” he implores to his lover: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s nothin’ wrong with me / Lovin’ you, baby love, love / And givin’ yourself to me can never be wrong / If the love is true, oh baby.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In “Close the Door,” Pendergrass similarly tells his lover: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Close the door / Let me give you what you’ve been waiting for / Baby I got so much love to give / And I wanna give it all … to you …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One challenge for the songwriters like <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2021/04/10/the-sound-of-philadelphia-history/\">Gamble and Huff</a> was to balance the sensuality that fans loved with Federal Communication Commission <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/obscene-indecent-and-profane-broadcasts\">rules regarding profane language</a>. Songs like “Turn Down the Lights,” written by Gamble and Huff for Pendergrass, describe a <a href=\"https://victoriaadvocate.com/2010/01/14/as-a-sex-symbol-teddy-pendergrass-was-romantic-not-explicit/\">detailed night of romance</a> without language that would be considered obscene by the FCC.</p>\n\n<h2>Slow jams and sex positivity</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/03/22/play-another-slow-jam-this-time-make-it-sweet/\">R&amp;B and soul slow jams</a> by artists like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npJEvAETHVU\">Freddie Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u_u4nlYmNs\">Vandross</a> dominated bedroom music through the 1980s, although derivative genres like neo-soul and quiet storm continued to produce bedroom ballads like Gaye’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjlSiASsUIs\">Sexual Healing</a>” in 1982. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/05/madonna-vs-cyndi-lauper-careers-taught-art/\">Madonna and Cyndi Lauper</a> helped bring a female perspective to more sex-positive pop music with songs including “Like a Virgin” and “She Bop.” <a href=\"https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2002/12/04/rhythms-that-make-yo/\">Janet Jackson and Salt-N-Pepa</a> did the same in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HO9H1VMMOk\">R&amp;B</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g\">hip-hop</a>. Other groups embraced their sex symbol status through the 1990s, exemplified by TLC’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmH4_pr6mH0\">Ain’t 2 Proud 2 Beg</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlZydtG3xqI\">Creep</a>,” and Next’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEZRPkAAu8\">Too Close</a>.” The artists of the 1980s and 1990s were also <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2025/12/02/streaming-killed-video-star\">boosted by MTV</a>, bringing a visual element to their sensual lyrics.</p>\n\n<p>The emergence of <a href=\"https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/little-did-the-90s-know-it-but-bell-biv-devoes-brand-of-new-jack-swing/article_6799434a-34d1-5f1d-ab6e-177338b72a85.html\">new jack swing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/new-jack-swing-summer-1988-new-edition-bobby-brown-8462009/\">a term coined in 1987</a> to define a new style that combined dance, hip-hop and R&amp;B, ushered in higher-tempo erotic songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6HNbdi9AA\">Do Me!</a>” by <a href=\"https://bellbivdevoe.com/\">Bel Biv Devoe</a> along with slower bedroom ballads like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV8vB1BB2qc\">I’ll Make Love to You</a>” by Philadelphia’s <a href=\"https://boyziimen.com/\">Boyz II Men</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV8vB1BB2qc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Philly’s Boyz II Men carried the bedroom ballad tradition into the 1990s with “I’ll Make Love to You.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Bedroom ballads with disco-synth makeover</h2>\n\n<p>Philadelphia International’s sound and sensual lyrics have reemerged in recent years through artists Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, whose synth-pop and disco sound can be traced back to Gamble and Huff, and the label’s stable of artists. </p>\n\n<p>Proto-disco songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTt649Hvtxs\">The Love I Lost</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIkcB8GObo\">Don’t Leave Me This Way</a>” by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, and Pendergrass’ disco hit “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAku7KqQPeU\">Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose</a>” – or his later synthesizer-heavy album “Joy” – would influence <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/02/02/arts/music/billie-eilish-charli-xcx-chappell-roan-sabrina-carpenter\">current synth-pop hits</a> like Roan’s disco-influenced “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18\">Pink Pony Club</a>” and Carpenter’s synth-pop “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTLdJ-CM7TQ\">Manchild</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR3Liudev18?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chappell Roan’s campy, disco-influenced hit “Pink Pony Club.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Carpenter in particular has seemingly struck that balance between mainstream success and sensual lyrics. Her past three albums have been certified platinum and embrace increasingly mature themes such as female arousal. </p>\n\n<p>“Man’s Best Friend,” released in August 2025, sparked controversy with a sexually suggestive album cover that further <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250830-sabrina-carpenter-to-taylor-swift-why-female-popstars-embracing-sex-is-still-controversial-in-2025\">cemented her Carpenter’s symbol image</a>. This image is reinforced by her stage presence, like dancing in her underwear on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJP1EBKFsfw\">Saturday Night Live</a>” and mature songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vuCByb6js\">Tears</a>,” </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9vuCByb6js?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">“Tears” by Sabrina Carpenter.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Pendergrass’ career was derailed when he lost control of his car on Lincoln Drive in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia in 1982. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/us/singer-suffers-spinal-injury-in-auto-crash-in-philadelphia.html\">The accident left him a tetraplegic</a>.

      "content": "<p>Brazil’s “<a href=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/law/news/2025/09/01/organized-crime-now-also-an-economic-challenge-in-brazil.ghtml\">criminal economy</a>” does not appear on any national balance sheet. Yet the cost of violence, contraband, tax evasion and environmental crime can be measured in the tens of billions of dollars every year and serves as a major drag on Brazil’s economic growth and stability.</p>\n\n<p>Attempts to quantify this burden go back at least a decade. An influential <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and-Violence-New-Evidence-and-Insights-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf\">2017 study by the Inter-American Development Bank</a> estimated that crime and violence consumes roughly 3.4% of gross domestic product across Latin America and the Caribbean, with <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and-Violence-New-Evidence-and-Insights-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Brazil among the worst-affected countries</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasviolencia/noticia/55/gastos-com-a-violencia-no-brasil-correspondem-a-59-do-pib-diz-pesquisa\">later assessment</a> by Brazil’s own Institute for Applied Economic Research put the annual cost of violence alone at 5.9% of GDP. </p>\n\n<p>Such figures are usually calculated by looking at the cost of violence and crime on the lost earnings of people killed or incarcerated through crime, the medical costs of dealing with the aftermath of violence, the increased cost of security, and the value of damaged or stolen property.</p>\n\n<p>But headline figures still miss much of what never shows up in ledgers. They rarely capture the welfare cost of a homicide, the long-term earnings lost when a teen drops out of school because his neighborhood is dangerous, or the investment that never materializes because a company fears extortion or theft. </p>\n\n<p>As such, some researchers <a href=\"https://pesquisa.ie.unicamp.br/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2019/06/IPEA-Atlas-da-Violencia-2019.pdf\">contend</a> that even a 5.9% estimate should be seen as a lower bound on the cost of violence. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, a <a href=\"https://exame.com/revista-exame/13-trilhao-de-reais-para-o-crime/\">recent analysis</a> of official statistics and private surveys suggest that once indirect losses are fully accounted for, crime may be shaving <a href=\"https://interlira-reports.com/featured/the-impact-of-violence-on-businesses-in-brazil-part-2/07/08/2023/\">around 11%</a> off Brazil’s annual GDP. I believe the real cost could be even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath these totals lies an enormous underground economy that both feeds and conceals illegality. The Underground Economy Index <a href=\"https://www.etco.org.br/projetos/economia-subterranea/economia-subterranea-movimenta-r-17-trilhoes-no-brasil-e-volta-ao-padrao-pre-pandemia/\">estimates that unregistered or informal activity</a> accounted for 17.8% of Brazil’s GDP in 2022, or <a href=\"https://www.etco.org.br/tag/indice-de-economia-subterranea/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">around US$313 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Not all of that is criminal. For many microbusinesses, an informal economy is a survival strategy. But such a vast cash-based economy offers ideal cover for smuggling, tax fraud, counterfeit goods and money laundering, making enforcement vastly more complex.</p>\n\n<h2>From contraband to cargo theft</h2>\n\n<p>Illicit commerce now mirrors the formal economy in scale and diversity. A <a href=\"https://exame.com/economia/contrabando-falsificacao-e-pirataria-prejuizo-chega-a-quase-meio-trilhao-de-reais-diz-fncp/\">recent survey</a> by the National Forum Against Piracy and Illegality found that contraband, falsification and piracy cost Brazil roughly $86 billion in 2024, including $60 billion in lost sales for legitimate companies and $25 billion in unpaid taxes. </p>\n\n<p>Tobacco, clothing, fuel, electronics and pharmaceuticals were among the hardest-hit sectors. Economists <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-72968-8_4\">caution</a> that such figures, based on self-reported industry losses, are imprecise; however, they do underscore how deeply illegal trade has penetrated mainstream markets.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil’s logistics sector offers a particularly stark illustration of how crime acts as a hidden surcharge on everyday goods. According to data compiled by the National Association of Cargo Transport and Logistics, the national haulage association, Brazil recorded <a href=\"https://jornal.usp.br/atualidades/roubo-de-cargas-bate-recorde-em-2024-com-prejuizo-de-r-12-bilhao/\">10,478 cargo thefts</a> in 2024, with estimated losses of $221 million. </p>\n\n<p>When the cost of fuel-related thefts and fraud are added, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-brazils-fuel-mafias-and-their-gas-station-money-laundering-machines-254422\">annual losses rise</a> to $5.34 billion. These crimes, concentrated along major freight corridors in the southeast of the country, force companies to invest in trackers, armored convoys and route changes – costs that ripple through supply chains and ultimately into final prices.</p>\n\n<h2>The new environmental criminal frontier</h2>\n\n<p>Brazil’s criminal economy also burrows into its rivers and forests. A <a href=\"https://escolhas.org/novo-estudo-do-escolhas-revela-quase-metade-do-ouro-produzido-no-brasil-pode-ser-ilegal/\">landmark study</a> by the Choices Institute, a Brazilian think tank, documented that between 2015 and 2020, the country traded 229 tons of gold with signs of illegality, <a href=\"https://escolhas.org/novo-estudo-do-escolhas-revela-quase-metade-do-ouro-produzido-no-brasil-pode-ser-ilegal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">nearly half of total production over that period</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Much of this “suspect” gold <a href=\"https://projetocolabora.com.br/ods16/quase-metade-do-ouro-brasileiro-tem-indicios-de-ilegalidade/\">appears to originate</a> from Indigenous territories or environmental protection areas in the Amazon. That volume is worth tens of billions of dollars, providing a ready vehicle for laundering proceeds from other illicit markets while starving the treasury of royalties and taxes.</p>\n\n<p>The environmental ledger may be the most underappreciated of all. The MapBiomas Alerta project <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/\">confirmed</a> 74,218 deforestation alerts – which give authorities a heads-up on potential logging, fires or land clearance activity – in 2020 across Brazil, covering nearly 5370 square miles (13,900 square kilometers). An <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/RAD2020_FactSheet_FINAL_PT.pdf\">analysis</a> of those alerts found that nearly all bore signs of illegality. These trends have not changed. </p>\n\n<p>Deforestation in the Amazon not only eliminates trees, but it also drains the economy. A recent <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/pt-br/press-release/desmatamento-na-amazonia-ameaca-seguranca-energetica-do-pais-e-gera-perdas-de-bilhoes-para-setor-eletrico/\">study by the Climate Policy Initiative</a> estimates that Brazil’s Itaipu and Belo Monte hydroelectric plants together lose around 3,700 to 3,800 gigawatt-hours of potential generation each year because deforestation has weakened the “<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/amazon-water-flying-rivers-latin-america/\">flying rivers</a>” that carry moisture from the forest to the rest of Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>That lost energy, enough to provide power to roughly 1.5 million people, translates into more than $184 million in foregone revenue annually.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A fire is seen in a forest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Smoke from an illegal fire in Amazon state.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/smoke-from-illegal-fires-lit-by-farmers-rises-in-manaquiri-news-photo/1651329389?adppopup=true\">Michael Dantas/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lawlessness is a regressive tax</h2>\n\n<p>No single study can capture the entirety of Brazil’s criminal economy. Still, putting together the most conservative official numbers yields a rough balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>And even a cautious estimate would put the total cost at around <a href=\"https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/economia/macroeconomia/amazonia-vale-sete-vezes-mais-em-pe-cerca-de-r-15-tri-por-ano-diz-banco-mundial/\">$239 billion to $275 billion</a> annually – or 12% to 14% of Brazil’s GDP, by my estimate.</p>\n\n<p>These costs of crime are a hidden regressive tax, falling hardest on poor Brazilians who are more exposed to violence, more dependent on public services and less able to hedge against inflation or instability.</p>\n\n<p>And every dollar lost to corruption, contraband or illegal deforestation is a dollar that cannot be invested in schools, hospitals or clean energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Countering crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are, however, tentative signs that lawmakers and authorities are beginning to act on this calculus. The Finance Ministry has asked Congress to accelerate a <a href=\"https://www.otempo.com.br/politica/governo/2025/11/14/haddad-pede-que-camara-se-sensibilize-e-aprove-projetos-de-combate-ao-crime-organizado\">package of bills</a> that sharpen the definition and treatment of companies that bake systematic tax evasion into their business model, and to arm prosecutors and tax authorities with stronger tools to overcome the convoluted financial structures that shield them.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of a permanent unit to fight organized crime within the Justice Ministry, bringing together federal tax authorities, federal police, public prosecutors and state-level task forces, also points to a <a href=\"https://exame.com/brasil/o-crime-se-sofistica-e-o-estado-deve-se-sofisticar-contra-ele-diz-haddad-sobre-megaoperacao/\">growing recognition</a> that criminal entities operating within the formal economy can only be reached if fiscal, financial and criminal laws are applied in a coordinated way. </p>\n\n<p>In parallel, national authorities have signaled an intention to negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/brasil-busca-cooperacao-com-eua-para-combater-o-crime-organizado\">new cooperation framework</a> with Washington centered on information-sharing around money laundering, arms trafficking and large-scale tax fraud – embedding the fight against organized crime more explicitly in bilateral economic talks.</p>\n\n<p>And recent enforcement actions offer a glimpse of what a more systemic approach looks like in practice. In August 2025, [federal and state police] cracked down on a national criminal network that used a fintech “shadow bank” and at least 40 investment funds to launder illegal transactions involving roughly 1,000 gas stations from 2020 to 2024. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in November, Brazilian authorities <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2025/novembro/operacao-poco-de-lobato-receita-federal-e-orgaos-parceiros-desarticulam-esquema-bilionario-ligado-a-operacao-carbono-oculto\">executed 126 search and seizure warrants</a> in five states and secured judicial orders to freeze more than $1.8 billion in assets relating to criminal activities. </p>\n\n<p>These measures suggest that Brazil’s institutions – and the lawmakers who shape them – are beginning to treat crime not as an unavoidable backdrop to economic life, but as a macroeconomic distortion that can, and should, be confronted head-on.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is a translation of an article for The Conversation Brazil.

But as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxybJ_sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a scholar</a> of religion and politics, I have often seen how religious diplomacy complements conventional diplomatic tools – the pope’s visit being the most recent example.</p>\n\n<h2>Turkey and religious freedom</h2>\n\n<p>Lebanon and Turkey have a long history of Christianity, dating back to the early centuries of the religion. The Bible mentions <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:21-28&amp;version=NIV\">Jesus visiting Tyre and Sidon, coastal cities in Lebanon</a>. Many early Christian communities thrived in lands of modern-day Turkey, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CHO9781139600507.035\">such as Ephesus, Antioch and Cappadocia</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Despite Turkey’s significance in the history of Christianity, today Christians constitute less than 0.5% of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/christians-have-lived-in-turkey-for-two-millennia-but-their-future-is-uncertain-127296\">its population</a>. These include diverse Christian communities, from Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox to Roman Catholic and Protestant. </p>\n\n<p>Turkey’s constitution guarantees religious freedom, but Christians face legal and administrative hurdles in matters such as <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/alien-citizens-state-and-religious-minorities-turkey-and-france\">building places of worship</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The pope’s visit did not directly confront these structural issues, but the trip itself drew international <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pope-leo-xiv-opens-foreign-trip-visit-turkey-127923511\">attention to the plight of Christians</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The pope met with Muslim leaders to foster dialogue. He visited Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, an architectural icon for Turkish Muslims. In a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the pope emphasized Turkey’s role as “<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251127-pope-to-meet-erdogan-in-turkey-in-first-overseas-trip\">a bridge between East and West, Asia and Europe</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Even the pro-government media, which does not usually support rights for religious minorities, highlighted Turkey’s responsibility to provide religious freedoms for its <a href=\"https://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/papa-xiv-leonun-turkiye-ziyaretine-iliskin-ortaya-atilan-iddialar-tek-tek-curutuldu-iste-maddelerle-gercekler-7474197\">Christian minorities</a> in its coverage of the trip. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707252/original/file-20251209-56-af8b5u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Several people walking in a large dome-like structure with high ceilings.

They are followed by Greek Orthodox communities, concentrated in Beirut and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203864630\">Mount Lebanon</a>. Other groups include Melkite Greek Catholics, Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, Assyrians, Chaldean Catholics, Copts and various Protestant communities. </p>\n\n<p>Christians in Lebanon enjoy constitutional protections and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5474992_LEBANON-2023-INTERNATIONAL-RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM-REPORT.pdf\">better political representation</a> than Christians in other Middle Eastern countries. Lebanon’s confessional system allocates power among <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/melg/6/3/article-p250_5.xml\">religious communities</a>. The president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the speaker of the parliament must be a Shia Muslim; parliament and cabinet seats are split equally between Christians and Muslims. </p>\n\n<p>However, Christians are concerned with their <a href=\"https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1486323/from-north-to-south-lebanons-christians-live-in-fear-of-a-great-decline.html\">decreasing population in Lebanon</a>. They constituted over 50% of the population when Lebanon <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40262539\">gained its independence from France in 1943</a>. Over the years, many Christians left Lebanon because of economic pressures, <a href=\"https://eclj.org/religious-freedom/un/sud-liban-reconstruire-esperance-chretiens-pris-entre-deux-fronts\">the dominance of the Shia group Hezbollah</a> and insecurity stemming from Israeli strikes. </p>\n\n<p>The pope advised political leaders to prioritize cooperation over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/pope-leo-xiv/pope-leo-xiv-calls-lebanese-leaders-for-peace-rcna246560\">sectarian interests</a> within its confessional political system. As a gesture, he joined Muslim leaders in Martyrs’ Square in Beirut and shared readings from <a href=\"https://www.asianews.it/news-en/Popes-words-in-Beiruts-Martyrs'-Square-echo-among-the-people-64393.html\">both the Gospels and the Quran</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Moral boost</h2>\n\n<p>The pope’s visit provided a morale boost for <a href=\"https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2025/12/pastors-in-lebanon-hope-papal-visit-will-give-boost-to-christians-civil-rights\">Lebanese Christians</a>. Many saw the pope’s presence as encouragement to stay in Lebanon <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pope-visit-christian-sites-lebanon-encourages-christians-abandon-127992830\">despite all the concerns</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, some <a href=\"https://www.wrkf.org/npr-news/2025-11-29/popes-visit-to-lebanon-sparks-hope-but-also-frustration\">expressed disappointment</a> that the pope did not travel to southern Lebanon, where Christian villages have suffered from Israeli strikes. </p>\n\n<p>However, the pope reiterated the Vatican’s support for a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/world/middleeast/pope-leo-two-state-solution-israel.html\">two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian</a> conflict as the only way to resolve “the conflict they continually live.” </p>\n\n<h2>Religious diplomacy</h2>\n\n<p>Through his visits to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV intertwined religious teachings with cultural gestures to promote a message of peaceful coexistence.</p>\n\n<p>By meeting Christian groups in Turkey and Lebanon, he offered moral support and visibility to minorities facing insecurity and emigration pressures. By meeting with Muslim leaders, he showcased the Vatican’s commitment to coexistence and dialogue with Islam.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the pope’s religious diplomacy will lead to tangible policy outcomes. Yet, one thing is clear: Religious diplomacy serves as a valuable tool for encouraging dialogue and understanding as it did with the pope’s visit.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271208/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ramazan Kılınç does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It dovetails, moreover, with a ubiquitous political slogan: “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/hillary-clinton-just-said-it-but-the-future-is-female-began-as-a-1970s-lesbian-separatist-slogan/\">The future is female</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-trump-promotes-a-radical-unscientific-theory-about-sex-and-gender-in-the-name-of-opposing-gender-ideology-extremism-250552\">historical moment</a> when society is bitterly contesting ideas about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/anti-trans-measures-dont-just-target-transgender-men-and-women-a-sociologist-explains-how-male-or-female-categories-miss-the-mark-for-nonbinary-americans-251443\">gender</a>, we’d note that these notions still rely on a simplistic binary.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://religiousstudies.calpoly.edu/faculty-staff/anya-foxen\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.uh.edu/class/ccs/people/borkataky-varma/\">scholars</a> who study the entangled history of spirituality and gender, we often observe an especially fraught version of this dynamic playing out among “spiritual but not religious” practitioners, often called spiritual seekers. To many such people, the divine feminine represents an escape from oppressive gender norms, and yet many stumble in trying to reconcile the idea with the embodied realities of biological sex.</p>\n\n<p>An approach that escapes this dilemma is the centuries-old Kundalini tradition, which paints a model of the divine feminine beyond gender altogether.</p>\n\n<h2>The feminine Shakti</h2>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-the-early-church-thought-about-gods-gender-100077\">certainly examples</a> of the feminine divine to be drawn from Christian and other Abrahamic religious traditions. Yet many seekers quickly find themselves reaching beyond these borders.</p>\n\n<p>When they do, one of the first concepts they come across is Shakti, a divine feminine energy that manifests in the human body as the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-serpents-tale/9780231559430/\">electrifying force of Kundalini</a>. Both terms originate in South Asian religions – especially Hinduism – that fall under the broad umbrella of tantra. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691057798/tantra-in-practice\">Tantric cultural and spiritual traditions</a>, which began to emerge in the early centuries of the Common Era, take a positive perspective on the material world in general and the human body in particular, as opposed to traditions that regard both as inherently illusory or sinful. In tantra, the material world and physical body are suffused by divine energy. This energy is called Shakti, and it is feminine.</p>\n\n<p>Another key idea common to tantric traditions is that the universe is composed of two fundamental principles – or rather that it has two poles: a dynamic energy, which is female, balanced by an unchanging consciousness, which is male. As the great Goddess, Shakti goes by many names, including Durga, Kali and myriad others. The masculine principle is usually called Shiva, though this can vary as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Divinity beyond binaries</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780197549889.001.0001\">Tantric traditions</a> span over a millennium in time and a subcontinent in space, so it should come as no surprise that they are incredibly diverse. However, most practices that enjoy global popularity today, especially those centered on the divine feminine energy of Kundalini, can be traced to a specific tradition called <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/K/Kundalini\">Kaula Tantra</a>, which developed in the northeast of modern-day India near Kashmir.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left \">\n            <img alt=\"An old painting of a many-armed religious figure.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A picture of tantric art from the 19th century.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/tantra-is-an-esoteric-current-of-hinduism-the-word-tantra-news-photo/1354453057?adppopup=true\">Pictures From History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This tradition is distinctive by maintaining that while the cosmos is polar, it is also nondual, meaning that there is only one ultimate reality. So, the pairing of Shakti and Shiva, feminine and masculine, energy and consciousness, is best understood not as a binary but as the two sides of a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-timeless-journey-of-the-moebius-strip/\">Mobiüs strip</a>, where one seamlessly flows into the other.</p>\n\n<p>Take a strip of paper, twist it into a figure eight – also the symbol we use for infinity – and glue the back to the front. That’s the Kaula model of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>In such a world, Shiva is Shakti. The masculine is the feminine. Both are divine, but even more than this, both are ultimate, because there is no difference between them. God is goddess, and both are nonbinary.</p>\n\n<h2>Awakening Kundalini</h2>\n\n<p>Kundalini yoga is a centuries-old practice quite different from the branded version popularized more recently by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/us/yogi-bhajan-75-boss-of-worlds-spiritual-and-capitalistic-dies.html\">Yogi Bhajan</a>. It involves using complex meditative and physical techniques to awaken and raise this energy from its usual resting place in the bottom of the torso.</p>\n\n<p>In doing this, tradition says the practitioner experiences a radical transformation both of the body and of consciousness. Premodern texts describe Kundalini’s fiery energy burning through the tissues of the body, shooting up to the crown of the head, where the feminine Shakti unites with her masculine counterpart and all dissolves into oneness.</p>\n\n<p>While some texts treat this ascent as equivalent to a sort of voluntary death, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/537595/roots-of-yoga-by-translated-and-edited-with-an-introduction-by-james-mallinson-and-mark-singleton/\">others describe how, once she has ascended</a>, Kundalini returns to bathe the body in a cooling nectar of immortality, resulting in an embodied state of enlightenment and liberation.</p>\n\n<p>According to this tradition, the body may appear the same but is now enlivened with a new consciousness that has transcended all dualities – including male and female.</p>\n\n<h2>Is the divine feminine female?</h2>\n\n<p>Human gender norms often prove difficult to shake, however. Though the energy of Kundalini is understood as feminine, Kundalini yoga in South Asia has been traditionally practiced by men. The reasons for this are perhaps almost entirely social, and yet they remain a powerful force.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, the very fact that Kundalini is often believed to be associated with womanhood has resulted in women being excluded – or at least deprioritized – from cultivating their own practice. Instead, they have historically become <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/K/bo3617827.html\">assistants or accessories</a> to the enlightenment of men.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-serpents-tale/9780231559430/\">fieldwork we present in our recent book</a> on the topic bears this out. Among South Asian practitioners, the common attitude is that women embody the maternal principle, and this makes them extremely powerful. In them, the energy of Kundalini operates naturally. Men, on the other hand, need to be purified by a woman through ritual in order to effectively engage in Kundalini practice.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman meditates in the forest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A woman meditates during festival for a modern, branded version of Kundalini yoga.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/forest-meditation-at-kundalini-yoga-festival-news-photo/169369091\">Godong/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Such ideas are also common among Western practitioners, who tend to believe women have a more natural aptitude for Kundalini awakening. One of our subjects said this is because women have less ego. Another attributed it to female sexual fluids.</p>\n\n<p>However, cultural difference plays a role, too. Western notions of the divine feminine are much more inclined to cling to the binary, resisting the idea that male and female bodies alike are ultimately woven from the same nondual reality.</p>\n\n<p>Most striking, perhaps, one man who had spent a lifetime among seekers at spiritual retreats in the U.S. and South America told us of a long-held and common belief that only women were capable of Kundalini experience. It was, to him, an energy exclusive to the female body. He recounted having been shocked, only months prior, at encountering a copy of the 1967 classic <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/kundalini-the-evolutionary-energy-in-man-gopi-krishna/page/n3/mode/2up\">“Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man</a>,” authored by the decidedly male Gopi Krishna.</p>\n\n<p>The broader point, however, is that the historical core of Kundalini practice has always been about transcending all dualities.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, even as a goddess representing the ultimate “She,” Kundalini is best understood as nonbinary. Perhaps if we can wrap our heads around this idea, we can cultivate a more inclusive empowerment.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263402/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Of the five SIMPLEx missions selected so far, three have failed after launch due to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/lunar-trailblazer/nasas-lunar-trailblazer-moon-mission-ends/\">equipment problems</a> that might have been caught in more traditional, tightly managed programs. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/janus/\">A fourth</a> sits in indefinite storage. </p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE will not begin returning science data for about 30 months, and the program’s history suggests the odds are not entirely in its favor. Nonetheless, the calculus goes that if enough of these missions are successful, NASA can achieve valuable science at a reduced cost – even with some losses along the way. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704634/original/file-20251125-56-ynheuz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two images showing the side of a solar panel.

They use thoroughly proven hardware and undergo exhaustive testing.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE is at the other end. It’s a class D mission, defined as having “high risk tolerance” and “medium to low complexity.”</p>\n\n<p>Of the <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250005285/downloads/Class%20D%20Technical%20Note_20250521A.pdf\">21 class D missions</a> that have launched since the designation was first applied in 2009, NASA has not had a single class D mission launch on schedule. Only four remained under budget. Four were canceled outright prior to launch.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE, which will have cost an estimated US$94.2 million by the end of its science operations in 2029, has stayed under the $100 million mark through a series of cost‑saving choices. It has a <a href=\"https://escapade.ssl.berkeley.edu/instruments/\">small set of key instruments</a>, a low spacecraft mass to reduce launch costs, and extensively uses generic commercial components instead of custom hardware.</p>\n\n<p>NASA also outsourced to private companies: Much of the spacecraft development went to <a href=\"https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/escapade/\">Rocket Lab</a> and the trajectory design to <a href=\"https://advancedspace.com/escapade/\">Advanced Space LLC</a>, with tight contract limits to make sure the contractors didn’t go over budget.</p>\n\n<p>Additional savings came from creative arrangements, including the university‑funded VISIONS camera package and a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-landed-its-booster-on-a-barge-at-sea-an-achievement-that-will-broaden-the-commercial-spaceflight-market-269786\">discounted ride on New Glenn</a>, which Blue Origin wanted to fly anyway for its own testing objectives.</p>\n\n<h2>Commercial space</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ESCAPADE launched at a moment of transition in space science. </p>\n\n<p>NASA and other science agencies are facing the <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts\">steepest budget pressures in more than 60 years</a>, with political winds <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-sets-the-stage-for-nasas-return-to-the-moon/\">shifting funding toward human spaceflight</a>. At the same time, the <a href=\"https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/news/drivers-of-the-space-economy/\">commercial space sector is booming</a>, with long-imagined technologies that enable cheap space travel finally entering service.</p>\n\n<p>That boom has, in part, led to a resurgence in NASA’s “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2022.101515\">faster, better, cheaper</a>” push that originated in the 1980s and ‘90s – and which largely faded after the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/19476-space-shuttle-columbia-disaster-oversight.html\">2003 Columbia disaster</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In theory, leaner NASA oversight, greater use of off‑the‑shelf hardware and narrower science goals can cut costs while launching more missions and increasing the total science return. If ESCAPADE succeeds in delivering important science, it will be held up as evidence that this more commercial, risk-tolerant template can deliver.</p>\n\n<h2>The trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/rookisaacman/status/1985796145017471442\">A concept</a> put forward by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-nomination-for-nasa-leader-boasts-business-and-commercial-spaceflight-experience-during-a-period-of-uncertainty-for-the-agency-254274\">Jared Isaacman</a>, the Trump administration’s nominee to lead NASA, is that 10 $100 million missions would be better than one $1 billion flagship – or top-tier – mission. This approach could encourage faster mission development and would diversify the types of missions heading out into the solar system. </p>\n\n<p>But that reorganization comes with trade-offs. For example, low‑cost missions rarely match flagship missions in scope, and they typically do less to advance the technology necessary for doing innovative science.</p>\n\n<p>With a narrow scope, missions like ESCAPADE are unlikely to produce the most transformative discoveries about, for instance, the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/search-for-life/beginnings-life-on-our-world-and-others/\">origins of life</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/mapping-dark-matter/\">nature of dark matter</a>, or the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/why-europa-ingredients-for-life/\">first chemical analyses of oceans on a new world</a>. Instead, they focus on more specific questions.</p>\n\n<p>Early in ESCAPADE’s development, my role was to help create a planning document for the VISIONS cameras called the Science Traceability Matrix, which defines an instrument’s scientific goals and translates them into concrete measurement requirements.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I systematically asked: What do we want to learn? What observations prove it? And, critically, how precisely does the instrument need to work to be “good enough,” given the budget? Loftier goals usually demand more complex instruments and operations, which drive up costs.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE’s broader goals are to create a clearer picture of Mars’ magnetic field, how the solar wind interacts with it, and figure out what that process does to Mars’ atmosphere. That is valuable science. But it is more modest than the $583 million predecessor mission <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/maven/\">MAVEN’s more extensive scope and richer suite of instruments</a>. It was MAVEN that determined how and when Mars lost its once-dense atmosphere in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>Both ESCAPADE and MAVEN are dwarfed again by the open‑ended potential of an operation like the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-can-the-james-webb-space-telescope-see-so-far-257421\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, which observes a limitless slate of astronomical objects in the infrared light spectrum with a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-we-sharpened-the-james-webb-telescopes-vision-from-a-million-kilometres-away-262510\">higher resolution</a> than any combination of prior smaller telescopes.</p>\n\n<p>Flagship missions like the James Webb Space Telescope push the state of the art in new technologies and materials. These innovations then <a href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/\">filter into both future missions and everyday life</a>. For example, the Webb telescope advanced the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/webb-jwst-spinoffs-v122011.pdf\">medical tools used in eye exams</a>. Smaller missions rely more heavily on existing, mature technologies. </p>\n\n<p>And when systems are built by private companies rather than NASA, those companies keep tight control over the patents rather than openly spreading the technology across the scientific community.</p>\n\n<h2>A tense road to launch</h2>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE’s principal investigator, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ON3sy2YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Rob Lillis</a>, has joked that it is the mission with 11 lives, having survived 11 near‑cancellations. Problems ranged from being late in reaching the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/\">technology readiness levels</a> that helped ensure the probes wouldn’t malfunction after launch, to the loss of its original free ride, with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nasas-psyche-asteroid-mission-a-3-6-billion-kilometre-journey-to-the-centre-of-the-earth-215707\">NASA’s Psyche mission</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, ESCAPADE received support from NASA to ride on New Glenn’s maiden flight, only to face delays as Blue Origin worked through <a href=\"https://payloadspace.com/new-glenn-debut-delayed-along-with-escapade-mars-mission/\">technical hurdles</a>. At last, in October 2025, ESCAPADE reached the launchpad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I traveled to Cape Canaveral for the launch and felt the tension firsthand. The first window was scrubbed by <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/blue-origin-delays-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket-carrying-nasa-mars-probes-may-seek-exemption-from-faa-order-for-next-try\">bad weather and issues with ground equipment</a>. Then a strong solar storm — ironically, a key driver of the very processes ESCAPADE will study — shut down the second window. </p>\n\n<p>Concurrently, the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/faa-restricts-commercial-rocket-launches-indefinitely-due-to-air-traffic-risks-from-government-shutdown\">Federal Aviation Administration imposed new launch restrictions</a> due to the government shutdown that would have postponed the launch further if not for a last-minute exemption. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, on Nov. 13, after repeated setbacks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvURVG_b10\">New Glenn lifted off to cheers</a> around the country. ESCAPADE reached orbit, and after a nervous few hours of receiver misalignment, mission controllers established communication with the spacecraft.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>While in Florida, I also watched another milestone in commercial spaceflight: the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-starlink-launch-group-6-87-jrti\">record-breaking 94th launch</a> from Cape Canaveral in 2025, marking the most launches from Florida in a single year.

Our research has found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15555240.2025.2541021\">76% of employees</a> want to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-allyship-a-brief-history-present-and-future-220668\">be allies</a> to co-workers who face additional challenges, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vt7bf_v3\">84% value equity</a>. That’s in line with a 2025 <a href=\"https://www.catalyst.org/insights/2025/risks-of-retreat-path-forward\">national survey</a> that found 88% of employees supported employers offering training on how to be more inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>So why doesn’t that support always turn into action?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15555240.2025.2541021\">Our new study</a> in the Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health points to one reason: Some people may freeze with worry because they feel like a fake. Specifically, they feel like they don’t have the skills to effectively support their marginalized co-workers, even though they want to. Those feelings may block action, which makes people feel even more fraudulent – creating a loop that’s hard to break.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we – <a href=\"https://cbe.wwu.edu/people/warren4\">Meg Warren</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.wwu.edu/michaelwarren/about/\">Michael T. Warren</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J87P7O4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">John LaVelle</a> – found that 1 in 5 people who want to support marginalized groups experience the impostor phenomenon even when they have the skills to be effective allies.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/job.2733\">impostor phenomenon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kateatkin.com/imposter/\">formerly called the “impostor syndrome,”</a> is the feeling that you’re not good enough – even when there’s objective evidence that you are. Researchers have documented it across many workplace and professional settings, including in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-025-02898-4\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3639475.3640114\">technology</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2019.05.001\">entrepreneurship</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kornferry.com/about-us/press/71percent-of-us-ceos-experience-imposter-syndrome-new-korn-ferry-research-finds\">the C-suite</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03634523.2024.2320757\">academia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, these feelings are linked to significantly higher anxiety and feelings of depression among people who want to be allies. We found that men, leaders, younger employees and people of color were more likely to experience the impostor phenomenon in the context of allyship.</p>\n\n<h2>What the impostor phenomenon looks like for allies</h2>\n\n<p>Consider “James,” a senior project manager. For the past few years, his company has expected all managers to undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training and to support the company’s Black Employee Network. Earlier this year, however, the company publicly withdrew its commitment to DEI and removed all mentions of it from its website. </p>\n\n<p>When his team asked for his thoughts, James felt lost. The facts he learned during the Black Employee Network meetings were unsettling and undeniable. Before, he regularly cited these during various meetings with his colleagues and senior leaders. Now, he felt pressured to act as if none of this mattered. He felt frustrated, at a loss for words and a complete fake – like he didn’t know how to support his colleagues anymore.</p>\n\n<p>While “James” is a composite character drawn from many stories we’ve heard over the course of our research, his experience captures the bind that many would-be allies face.</p>\n\n<p>When allies feel this way, they often compare themselves to an imagined “perfect ally,” thinking that if they can’t be outrageously heroic, they must be failures. They then deal with feelings of inadequacy by procrastinating or overpreparing before stepping up for others – to the point where they miss crucial opportunities where they could have made a difference.</p>\n\n<p>People tend to feel like an impostor when they encounter a challenge that seems bigger than their ability to cope with it. So it’s not surprising that a lot of people feel this way about workplace equity. Inequity and bias play out in complex ways in organizations: The rules change rapidly, and people can receive mixed messages about what behaviors are appropriate, valued and rewarded. This can make allyship feel overwhelmingly challenging, even for those who are otherwise skilled.</p>\n\n<p>Work culture also matters. In toxic organizational cultures or hypercompetitive environments, people feel pressure to hide their mistakes, they worry about colleagues sabotaging their efforts, and they see humility as a weakness. In such places – and especially when the would-be ally’s role is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063211020358\">highly visible and entails heavy responsibility</a> – people are vulnerable to impostor feelings.</p>\n\n<p>Past criticism can add fuel, too. If you’ve been admonished for standing up for a colleague or have seen others be attacked – including by those who wish to maintain an unjust status quo – you might further feel pressure to only act in ways that are immune to criticism. That’s an impossible standard.</p>\n\n<h2>Consequences of feeling like an impostor: Feeling worse, doing worse</h2>\n\n<p>Leaders in particular are vulnerable to feeling like impostors on allyship. Many haven’t been properly trained on how to listen to and support co-workers who might be facing discrimination and are quietly suffering, yet are held responsible for solving complex issues around fairness that long predated them. </p>\n\n<p>And when stuck in this uncomfortable space, people who feel like impostors are likely to become defensive and feel pressured to be a hero. To prove themselves, they may <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-00613-7\">overcompensate in ways that backfire</a> – for example, by loudly claiming support for disadvantaged workers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12724\">without following up with useful action</a>, or by swooping in to fix issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/19/no-more-white-saviours-thanks-how-to-be-a-true-anti-racist-ally\">without respecting the preferences of the people involved</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this not only affects their ability to be a supportive colleague, but it also likely harms their mental health. Indeed, the impostor phenomenon has been found to be linked to heightened anxiety and feelings of depression, both in our study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0000397-004\">and beyond</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So you might wonder: What if I opt out of all of this by not thinking about inequity at all? Our research suggests that this is a bad idea. People who are disengaged from issues of inequity, and who don’t invest in learning and growing as allies, experience lower self-confidence at work and have lower job satisfaction. Checking out of allyship could be bad for your professional well-being.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is you don’t have to be stuck feeling this way. You can take low-risk, bite-sized actions that can pull you out of feeling fake and boost your confidence, all while improving your own professional success <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721416686212\">and mental health</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-and-happier/202509/lead-inclusively-by-harnessing-the-power-of-joy\">Research points to</a> three simple ways forward. First, recognize and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-and-happier/202505/the-importance-of-loudly-celebrating-others-strengths\">loudly celebrate the strengths</a> of marginalized colleagues, which creates an uplifting work culture. Second, take concrete steps to build trust – for example, by <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-11504-001\">giving proper credit</a> to a disadvantaged colleague if their merit is wrongfully questioned. And finally, overcome your cynicism – which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1529798\">research shows</a> invariably suppresses constructive action – and instead adamantly choose hope, even when it’s hard.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271081/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Using consumer price indices for the main components of medical care – such as services provided in clinics and hospitals as well as administrative expenses – based on federal data and data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, we found that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.47462\">the cost of hospital services increased the most</a>, while the cost of physician services and prescription drugs rose more slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the premium increases can be attributed to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/outpatient-visits-are-increasingly-billed-at-higher-levels-implications-for-health-costs/\">hospital outpatient visits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/annual-family-premiums-for-employer-coverage-rise-6-in-2025-nearing-27000-with-workers-paying-6850-toward-premiums-out-of-their-paychecks/\">coverage of GLP-1 drugs</a>. But research, including our own, suggests that premiums have rapidly escalated mostly because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/forefront.20240906.397095\">health system consolidation</a> – when hospitals and other health care entities merge – has led hospitals to raise prices well above their costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Hospital CEOs prioritize profit</h2>\n\n<p>Hospitals are aggressively raising their prices because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000002198\">hospital CEOs have incentives to do so</a>. </p>\n\n<p>One study found that for nonprofit health systems, the greatest pay increases between 2012 and 2019 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000002198\">went to hospital CEOs</a> who grew the profits and size of their organizations the most. However, the financial reward of delivering above-average quality of care declined. Increased <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/hospital-charity-care-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters/\">charity care</a> – free or discounted health services nonprofit hospitals must provide some of their patients who cannot afford medical care – was not significantly tied to CEO compensation.</p>\n\n<p>Board members set performance criteria that determine the base salary and bonus payments for CEOs. Over half of board members at top U.S. hospitals have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08056-z\">professional backgrounds in finance or business</a>. As a result, researchers and advocates have raised concerns that financial success is the dominant priority at these institutions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of medical bill and credit cards\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Health care is getting more expensive for everyone.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/hospital-bill-royalty-free-image/1036961842\">DNY59/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One way to help ensure that nonprofit hospitals make the health of their local communities a top priority is to require their boards to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/answers/execcomp.htm#\">disclose their executive compensation guidelines</a> for salary and bonuses, similar to the information that for-profit health care companies disclose to their stockholders. The general public could pressure companies to put greater weight on affordability and quality of care when setting performance targets for nonprofit hospital executives.</p>\n\n<p>Some economists suggest that <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/policy-proposal/a-proposal-to-cap-provider-prices-and-price-growth-in-the-commercial-health-care-market/\">hospital prices be regulated</a>. This approach involves capping prices for health care services at the most expensive hospitals and restricting price growth for all hospitals.

Perhaps not; the fact-checking site Snopes <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/feast-of-friends/\">found no evidence</a> of the association even existing. But the joke’s popularity points to a tradition cherished by many American Jews – Chinese food on Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>But why would Jews, who do not celebrate Christmas, have Christmas traditions? </p>\n\n<p>Like many minority groups, Jews have always created ways of adapting to the societies in which they live, but whose culture they do not totally share. And one thing that means is a collection of Christmas traditions, varying by time and place. Many of them came up in interviews for my book “<a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469636368/beyond-chrismukkah/\">Beyond Chrismukkah: The Christian-Jewish Interfaith Family in the United States</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>Old World festivities</h2>\n\n<p>Long before Jews came to the United States, some of them celebrated Christmas – participating in many of the cultural traditions, even as they avoided the religious part of the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://newlehrhaus.org/instructor/jordan-chad\">Jordan Chad</a>, author of “<a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479840786/christmas-in-yiddish-tradition/\">Christmas in Yiddish Tradition</a>,” Jewish folklore about the holiday appears as early as the late 1300s. Plenty of Jewish communities in Europe spent Christmas Eve dancing and drinking, <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/nittel-nacht-the-jewish-christmas-eve/\">feasting and gambling</a> – as many of their Christian neighbors did, when those neighbors were not in church. </p>\n\n<p>Other scholars have argued that these traditions grew out of attempts to <a href=\"https://blog.nli.org.il/en/nittel_nacht/\">avoid studying Jewish religious texts</a> on a Christian holiday. But Chad demonstrates that, over centuries, those customs came to celebrate the revelry of the season – though not the birth of Jesus. </p>\n\n<p>Even in the 20th century, scholars such as <a href=\"https://people.clas.ufl.edu/yfeller/\">Yaniv Feller</a> have found, many middle- and upper-class German <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9780773557956-009\">Jews embraced a secular Christmas</a>, complete <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2019/december/christmas-trees-jewish-homes.html\">with a tree</a>, a traditional dinner and presents. After all, some of those Christmas traditions stem less from religion than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hanukkah-celebrations-have-changed-dramatically-but-the-same-is-true-of-christmas-215119\">folk traditions</a> and industrialization. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A blue light in the shape of a Star of David sits atop a small bit of greenery.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some Jewish families decorate a ‘Hanukkah bush’ as a seasonal alternative to a Christmas tree.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/close-up-of-lighted-star-of-david-atop-a-chanukah-bush-san-news-photo/1196273537?adppopup=true\">Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Given that long history, Jewish Christmas traditions are not necessarily a sign of Americanization. </p>\n\n<p>That said, in the United States, Christmas is so culturally powerful – a day that almost everyone has off, and that the majority of Americans spend with their kith and kin – that many non-Christian immigrants <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/23/christmas-also-celebrated-by-many-non-christians/\">celebrate it in a secular way</a>, with family visits, Santa and a tree. They do not necessarily do the religious parts of the holiday, but they may well deck the halls. Certainly, my own Hindu relatives do. </p>\n\n<p>And many Jews celebrate Christmas <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/to-tree-or-not-to-tree-how-jewish-christian-families-navigate-the-december-dilemma-172840\">in some way</a> because they are part of interfaith families – whether their own immediate family or extended relatives with whom they spend the day. Today, estimates place the American Jewish interfaith marriage rate as high as 50%.</p>\n\n<h2>Kosher-style Chinese</h2>\n\n<p>For plenty of contemporary Jews, however, it is profoundly important not to celebrate a secular version of Christmas. Starting in the 1970s, in fact, when American Jews were particularly <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469636368/beyond-chrismukkah/\">worried about rising rates of interfaith marriage</a>, many of the rabbis willing to perform ceremonies for Jewish-Christian couples made them promise to not have a Christmas tree. This happened despite the fact that, at the time, many American Jews did have Christmas trees in their homes. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Jews do not want to deck the halls, though, many still have the day off. Meanwhile, their non-Jewish friends, families and co-workers are busy and much of the world is closed. And so many Jews have developed their own ways of marking the day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/25/573415894/why-do-jewish-people-eat-chinese-food-on-christmas\">The Chinese food tradition is particularly famous</a>. In fact, during Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan’s 2010 confirmation hearings, when Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham asked her where she had been on Christmas Day, she responded, “Like all Jews, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2010/06/kagan-i-spent-christmas-at-chinese-restaurant-027851\">I was probably at a Chinese restaurant</a>.” </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBlMmuuJpbI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Elena Kagan’s Senate confirmation hearings made mention of the famous tradition.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The first written mention of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas Day comes from 1935, when, according to The New York Times, a man named <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/26/archives/yule-stirs-chinese-to-aid-jewish-home-eng-shee-chuck-of-newark.html\">Eng Shee Chuck</a> brought chow mein and toys to a New Jersey Jewish orphanage. </p>\n\n<p>His generosity was probably not why Jews started going to Chinese restaurants on Christmas; it is more likely that they were already doing so. The two communities lived cheek by jowl in many American cities, where immigrants of different sorts ended up in the same neighborhoods. And Chinese food contains little dairy, meaning it rarely violated Jewish dietary laws against mixing milk and meat. </p>\n\n<p>Most Chinese cuisines do use pork and shrimp, which is forbidden by kosher laws. But many <a href=\"https://forward.com/culture/437007/jewish-christmas-chinese-food/\">Jewish customers were happy to make an exception</a>, especially if the forbidden food was tucked in a dumpling or otherwise out of sight – at least outside their own homes. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.mocanyc.org/event/moca-talks-shiyong-lu-kosher-chinese-food/\">new research by New York University graduate student Shiyong Lu</a> demonstrates, Chinese restaurants were also eager to cater to American Jews: They wanted to develop white, American clientele, and here were some right in their neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://wp.nyu.edu/artsampscience-cham/\">restaurant owners learned</a> that Jews often eschewed pork, some began to offer traditional dishes with chicken instead – allowing more observant Jews to eat “kosher style,” without eating explicitly forbidden food. Today, there is wide variation in Jewish dietary practices, making Chinese food even more accessible for most Jews.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photograph of two men in suit jackets and Jewish head coverings seated at a table with signs on the wall.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two men enjoy Chinese cuisine, prepared under kosher guidelines, around 1960.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/two-men-enjoy-chinese-cuisine-prepared-by-chinese-chefs-news-photo/514694012?adppopup=true\">Bettmann via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By the end of the 20th century, “Chinese food and a movie” had become <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/24308969/jewish-christmas-chinese-food-restaurant-myth-rg-lounge-san-francisco\">the trope of Jewish Christmas</a>. Because most Chinese immigrants were not Christian, their restaurants are <a href=\"https://reformjudaism.org/reform-jewish-life/food-recipes/why-some-jews-eat-chinese-food-christmas\">often open on Dec. 25</a>. And indeed, they are often filled with Jews.</p>\n\n<h2>Movies, volunteering and more</h2>\n\n<p>The same tends to be true for movie theaters. In 2012, I saw “Les Misérables” on Christmas Day in a theater that seemed to be a who’s who of the Atlanta Jewish community. In fact, the movies and the Chinese food are often paired, whether out on the town or at home, streaming with take out.</p>\n\n<p>Jewish museums are often open and are another popular destination in cities that have them. And some Jews <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-12-17/traveling-on-christmas-day-what-you-need-to-know\">use Christmas Day for travel</a>. At least in eras past, plane tickets were notably cheaper than the days around the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Another Jewish Christmas tradition is simply to go to work, so as to let Christian colleagues have the day off. Many Jewish doctors and nurses are on call, or <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3921605/non-christian-doctors-volunteer-to-work-christmas/\">staff the emergency room</a> or the intensive care unit, so that their colleagues can be home. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in blue protective equipment enters a room off of a corridor with a Christmas tree decorated in red ribbon, homemade ornaments, and a medical mask.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Christmas tree is decorated with the pandemic in mind in the COVID-19 ICU at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Mass., in December 2020.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/christmas-tree-is-decorated-with-the-pandemic-in-mind-in-news-photo/1230274960?adppopup=true\">Craig F.

Fallon / AFP via Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to major U.S. industries, three tends to be the magic number.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, auto manufacturing was <a href=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/products/once-upon-a-car-bill-vlasic-9780061845635\">long dominated by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors</a> – the so-called “Big Three,” which at one point controlled over 60% of the U.S. auto market. A dominant trio shows up elsewhere, too, in everything from the <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297a/U.S.%20Defense%20Industry%20and%20Arms%20Sales.htm\">U.S. defense market</a> – think Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrup Grumman – to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/201048/total-operating-revenues-of-us-telecommunication-providers/#:%7E:text=Verizon%20had%20the%20highest%20total,%2C%20and%20T%2DMobile%20US.\">cellphone service providers</a> (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon). The same goes for the U.S. airline industry in which American, Delta and United fly higher than the rest.</p>\n\n<p>The rule of three also applies to what Americans watch; the glory days of television was <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/decline-big-three-networks\">dominated by three giants</a>: ABC, CBS and NBC.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in the digital age, we are rapidly moving to a “Big Three” dominating streaming services: Netflix, Amazon and Disney.</p>\n\n<p>The latest step in that process is Netflix’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-82-7-billion-deal-1236601034/\">plan to acquire Warner Bros.</a> for US$72 billion. If approved, the move would solidify Netflix as the dominant streaming platform. </p>\n\n<h2>When streams converge</h2>\n\n<p>Starting life as a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-history-killed-blockbuster-dominated-hollywood-1236342853/\">mail DVD subscription service</a>, Netflix <a href=\"https://qz.com/887010/netflix-nflx-launched-streaming-video-10-years-ago-and-changed-the-way-we-watch-everything\">moved into streaming movies and TV shows in 2007</a>, becoming a first-mover into the sphere.</p>\n\n<p>Being an early adopter as viewing went from cable and legacy to online and streaming gave Netflix an advantages in also developing support technology and using subscriber data to create new content. </p>\n\n<p>The subsequent impact was Netflix became a market leader, with quarterly <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-profit-report-netflix-disney-warners-paramount-nbcu-1235868631/\">profits now far exceeding its competitors</a>, which often report losses.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, even without the Warner Bros. acquisition, Netflix has a dominant global base of <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/ir-overview/profile/default.aspx\">over 300 million subscribers</a>. Amazon Prime comes second with <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/technology/amazon-introduces-new-time-saving-feature-customers-will-love\">roughly 220 million subscribers</a>, and Disney – which includes both Disney+ and Hulu – is third, with roughly <a href=\"https://senalnews.com/en/data/disney-nears-200-million-streaming-subscribers-amid-strategic-shift#:%7E:text=The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company%20closed,also%20contributed%20to%20this%20growth.\">196 million subscribers</a>. This means that between them, these three companies already <a href=\"https://evoca.tv/streaming-service-market-share/\">control over 60% of the streaming market</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s lead would only be reinforced by the proposed deal with Warner Bros., as it would add ownership of Warner subsidiary HBO Max, which is currently the fourth-biggest streamer in the U.S. with a <a href=\"https://cordcuttersnews.com/hbo-max-added-2-3-million-subscribers-globally-in-q3-2025/\">combined 128 million subscribers</a>. While some of them will overlap, Netflix is likely to still gain subscribers and better retain them with a broader selection of content.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"YKfD7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YKfD7/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s move to acquire Warner Bros. also follows prior entertainment industry consolidation, driven by a desire to control content to retain streaming service subscribers. </p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Disney <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/20/705009029/disney-officially-owns-21st-century-fox\">acquired 21st Century Fox</a> for $71.3 billion. Three years later, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/amazon-mgm-merger-close-1235207852/\">Amazon acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> for $8.5 billion. </p>\n\n<p>Should the Netflix deal go through, it would continue this trend of streaming consolidation. It would also leave a clear gap at the top between the emerging Big Three and other services, such as Paramount+ with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-subscribers-streaming-loss-1236211289\">79 million subscribers</a> and Apple TV+, which has <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-streaming-losses-1-billion-per-year-1236344052/\">around 45 million</a>. Paramount on Dec. 8, 2025, announced a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/paramount-makes-1084-billion-bid-warner-bros-discovery-2025-12-08/\">a proposed $108.4 billion deal</a> that would, unlike the Netflix plan, include Warner Bros. subsidiary Discovery+.</p>\n\n<h2>Why industries come in threes</h2>\n\n<p>But why do industries converge to a handful of companies?</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://business.fsu.edu/person/david-r-king\">expert on mergers</a>, I know the answer comes down to market forces relating to competition, which tends to drive consolidation of an industry into three to five firms. </p>\n\n<p>From a customer perspective, there is a need for multiple options. Having more than one option avoids monopolistic practices that can see prices fixed at a higher rate. Competition between more than one big player is also a strong incentive for additional innovation to improve a product or service. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, governments – in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-sites-worldwide\">the U.S. and over 100 other countries</a> – have antitrust laws and practices to avoid any industry displaying limited competition. </p>\n\n<p>However, as industries become more stable, growth tends to slow and remaining businesses are forced to compete over a largely fixed market. This can separate companies into industry leaders and laggards. While leaders enjoy greater stability and predictable profits, laggards struggle to remain profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Lagging companies often combine to increase their market share and reduce costs.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that consolidating industries quite often land on three main players as a source of stability – one or two risks falling into the pitfalls of monopolies and duopolies, while many more than three to five <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1807049?seq=3\">can struggle to be profitable in mature industries</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s ahead for the laggards</h2>\n\n<p>The long-term viability of companies outside the “Big Three” streamers is in doubt, as the main players get bigger and smaller companies are unable to offer as much content. </p>\n\n<p>A temporary solution for smaller streamers to gain subscribers is to offer teaser rates that later increase for people that forget to cancel until companies take more permanent steps. But lagging services will also face increased pressure to exit streaming by licensing content to the leading streaming services, cease operations or sell their services and content.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, companies outside the Big Three could be tempted to acquire smaller services in an attempt to maintain market share.</p>\n\n<p>There are already rumors that Paramount, which is a competing bidder for Warner Bros., may <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/paramount-plus-with-showtime-buy-starz-lionsgate-spinoff-1234809754/\">seek to acquire Starz</a> or create a joint venture with Universal, which owns Peacock. </p>\n\n<p>Apple shows no immediate plan of discontinuing Apple TV+, but that may be due to the company’s high profitability and an overall cash flow that limits pressures to end its streaming service.</p>\n\n<p>Still, if the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal completes, it will likely increase the valuation of other lagging streaming services due to increased scarcity of valuable content and subscribers. This is due to competitive limits that restrict the Big Three from getting bigger, making the combination of smaller streaming services more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>This is reinforced by shareholders expecting similar or greater premiums from prior deals, driving the need to pay higher prices for the fewer remaining available assets. </p>\n\n<h2>The cost to consumers</h2>\n\n<p>So what does this all mean for consumers? </p>\n\n<p>I believe that in general, consumers will largely not be impacted when it comes to the overall cost of entertainment, as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/affordability-2025-inflation-food-prices-housing-child-care-health-costs/\">inflationary pressures for food and housing</a> limit available income for streaming services.</p>\n\n<p>But where they access content will continue to shift away from cable television and movie theaters. </p>\n\n<p>Greater stability in the streaming industry through consolidation into a Big Three model only confirms the decline in traditional cable.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s rationale in acquiring Warner Bros. is likely to enable it to offer streaming at a lower price than the combined price of separate subscriptions, but more than Netflix alone.</p>\n\n<p>This could be achieved through additional subscription tiers for Netflix subscribers wanting to add HBO Max content. Beyond competition with other members of the “Big Three,” another reason why Netflix is unlikely to raise prices significantly is that it will likely commit to not doing so in order to get the merger approved.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s goal is to ensure it remains consumer’s first choice for streaming TV and films. So while streaming is fast becoming a Big Three industry, Netflix’s plan is to remain at the top of the triangle. </p>\n\n<p><em>This article was updated on Dec. 8, 2025, with news of Paramount’s hostile bid.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271466/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David R.

But for the Federal Reserve, the purpose of its monetary policy is mandated by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>This is widely known as the Federal Reserve’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm\">dual mandate</a>: promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed itself <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">refers to these two objectives regularly</a> in its Federal Open Market Committee statements announcing its monetary policy decisions. </p>\n\n<p>A third objective of monetary policy, however, is less well-known: moderate long-term interest rates. </p>\n\n<p>This “third mandate” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/fed-third-mandate-forces-bond-traders-to-rethink-age-old-rules\">was a big news story</a> in September 2025, when the Trump administration’s newly appointed Fed governor, Stephen Miran, referred to it <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/miran_testimony_9-4-25.pdf\">in his testimony</a> before the Senate Banking Committee. Financial markets <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/trump-fed-miran-third-mandate\">paid close attention</a> to this aspect of the testimony because the comments suggested that Miran and other presidential appointees may focus on this third mandate – and on driving down long-term borrowing costs – more than the Fed has in the recent past.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ujPNgoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I’ve been closely following</a> how the Fed conducts monetary policy for many years. Miran is correct that Congress has tasked the U.S. central bank with all three of these objectives – but that’s not the whole story. In fact, none of these goals were originally spelled out in the act that set up the Fed over a century ago.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Fed’s goals have been revised several times – typically in response to a crisis.</p>\n\n<h2>The Fed’s shifting goals</h2>\n\n<p>The original purpose of the Fed, as explained in the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm\">Federal Reserve Act of 1913</a>, was to provide flexibility in the nation’s currency supply and to supervise the U.S. banking system. The current dual mandate was not part of the original goals of the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, its <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/feds-formative-years\">core goal was to reduce</a> the frequent banking panics that were costly to the economy and sharply increased interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>The first big change in the goals, in response to the Great Depression, was the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/employment-act-of-1946\">Employment Act of 1946</a> that stated the goal of federal government policy – and, therefore that of the Fed – is to “promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power.” </p>\n\n<p>This is where the two goals of the dual mandate first began to emerge, with purchasing power implying the Fed needed to keep inflation low.</p>\n\n<p>Following the macroeconomic instability of the 1970s with high unemployment and high inflation, Congress enacted the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed-reform-act-of-1977#footnote1\">Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977</a> that formalized the Fed mandate: “maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” </p>\n\n<p>In other words, Congress gave the Fed three mandates to follow in monetary policy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a white man wearing suit and glasses and without hair sits before a table with a microphone in a crowded room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stephen Miran mentioned the third mandate during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in September 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/SenateFederalReserve/2894c5957bc2451a9ba5ba4f4d0c1f7a/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What happened to the third mandate?</h2>\n\n<p>So why doesn’t the Fed still talk about that third mandate?</p>\n\n<p>Part of the answer is that moderate long-term interest rates <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/feds-powell-explains-how-central-bank-moderate-rates-mandate-works-2025-09-17/\">are a natural by-product</a> of successfully managing the other two. </p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of low inflation and maximum employment, the Fed primarily uses a short-term interest rate, known as the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS/\">Federal Funds rate</a>. When journalists report that the Fed raised or lowered interest rates, this refers to the so-called target rate that the central bank uses to control the Fed Funds rate. For example, the current target rate is a range of 3.75% to 4%, while the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\">effective Fed Funds rate is 3.89%</a>. Banks use the funds rate as the cost other banks must pay to borrow reserve funds for one day. </p>\n\n<p>However, most of the interest rates that matter to people, businesses and the economy at large have much longer terms – such as five, 10 or 30 years. Examples include mortgages, car loans and corporate bonds. The Fed does not directly control these longer-term interest rates, which are set by financial markets.  </p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(01)00055-1\">studies have found</a> that the Fed’s policy decisions <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(89)90025-1\">can influence long-term rates</a>, primarily due to “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/evidence-uncovered-long-term-interest-rates-monetary-policy-and-the-expectations-theory.htm\">expectations theory</a>.” That theory argues that long-term rates reflect financial markets’ expectations of future short-term rates.</p>\n\n<p>So if markets believe the Fed has inflation under control, they tend to keep long-term rates on mortgages and everything else low because they don’t expect the Fed will increase its target rate. If inflation is running high, long-term rates tend to rise because markets expect the Fed to have to lift its short-term rate to deal with it. But if unemployment is running high, long-term rates tend to fall because markets expect the Fed to reduce its short-term rate to deal with that.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term rates are, therefore, not independent of the dual mandate of the Fed. They are often an outcome of how successfully the Fed is meeting the dual mandate of full employment and stable prices currently and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Fed doesn’t typically talk about this third mandate. </p>\n\n<h2>Promoting economic stability</h2>\n\n<p>That said, the Fed has, at times, although very rarely, influenced long-term rates directly.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in late 2010, following the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath\">Great Recession of 2007-2009</a>, the Fed purchased billions of dollars’ worth of long-term Treasury bonds and other securities – a program known as “QE2” for quantitative easing – in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed did something similar in 1961 with <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2011/04/operation-twist-effect-large-scale-asset-purchases/\">Operation Twist</a>, similarly with an aim to support the U.S. economy by reducing long-term borrowing costs. </p>\n\n<p>But even this phase of quantitative easing was primarily about meeting the Fed’s dual mandate. More specifically, since inflation was already low, the Fed was trying to boost hiring in the wake of the Great Recession.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed is keenly aware that longer-term interest rates that are not aligned with its dual mandate can be an important source of instability in the economy. A modern central bank’s primary goal is to promote stability in the economy, so longer-term interest rates should be at levels that are appropriate to ensure current and future economic stability.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268052/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Arabinda Basistha does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Yet at various points in the book, you call them a “rebrand,” a “public relations facade” and “immigration enforcement assistance with an immigrant friendly face.” What’s behind those characterizations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There’s an internal tension to sanctuary policies. There’s this broader sanctuary movement that’s been around since roughly 1980, which came about largely in response <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sanctuary-cities-in-the-us-were-born-in-the-1980s-as-central-american-refugees-fled-civil-wars-257718\">to U.S. involvement in Central American civil wars</a> and protecting immigrants fleeing these and other conflicts. </p>\n\n<p>The activists started working with city officials sympathetic to their cause in cities such as San Francisco to create resolutions protecting immigrants that were largely symbolic. After the San Francisco Police Department was found to be ignoring the resolution, the city created the country’s <a href=\"https://wwwtest.progov21.org/Home/Document/E26L81\">first sanctuary ordinance in 1989</a>. With this ordinance, activists hoped that local police could be prevented from collaborating with federal immigration officers. </p>\n\n<p>But many activists assumed that the kind of ethics and the values that existed in the sanctuary movement could actually be taken up in policy and implemented, because there’s this notion that when you pass a law or ordinance it will be implemented as written. </p>\n\n<p>A major part of the book is to say, “Actually, that’s not how policy works.” It fits within these bureaucratic cultures. And in policing culture, there’s already this web of relationships that local cops have with federal agents, and these cultures have their own value systems. Something that people don’t really talk about is that local police aren’t just used by ICE as these local enforcers of immigration law. In fact, a lot of times local law enforcement look to ICE as partners and collaborators. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1924502816237801857&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where does the breakdown happen between policy and practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p>These current policies largely acknowledge the fact that the majority of the undocumented people that local law enforcement encounter don’t have criminal backgrounds. They say that what we want to target are these really terrible people who are the violent criminals.</p>\n\n<p>These criminals are framed as the exception to the rule. But these exceptions still end up leading to quite a few people being transferred by local police and jails to ICE. And the exceptions can easily be exploited or broadened by the boots on the ground – the police tasked with following the policy – because there’s often this gray area in the language.</p>\n\n<p>So what ends up happening is that there really isn’t any sort of major decrease in deportations in sanctuary jurisdictions. In 2018, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal issued his <a href=\"https://www.njoag.gov/trust/\">Immigrant Trust Directive</a>, which barred local law enforcement from helping federal authorities carry out civil-immigration enforcement. The last year before it was implemented, local police turned 1,000 people being held in local jails over to ICE. After it went into effect, that number went down slightly the following year, to 700 people. That’s still a lot of undocumented people being turned over. And it’s because local police were able to apply those “exceptional circumstances” in many of those cases.</p>\n\n<p>In Trump 2.0, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/65-people-taken-ice-had-no-convictions-93-no-violent-convictions\">roughly two-thirds of immigrants in the custody of ICE</a> have no criminal background. During the Biden administration, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/03/texas-trump-immigration-crackdown-ice-arrests-deportation/\">42% of them had no criminal background</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the book, you relay this one instance in New Jersey where ICE calls in the local police as backup, and the local police – aware of the state’s new Immigrant Trust Directive – describe their role on the scene to local activists and passersby as “protecting public safety.” Yet you point out that they actually are helping ICE, because their cars are parked to block the street so the targeted immigrant can’t drive away.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can have a policy, <a href=\"https://cd4.lacity.gov/press-releases/city-council-votes-to-establish-los-angeles-as-a-sanctuary-city/\">like the one that the Los Angeles City Council passed in 2024</a>, which was basically written as a “no cooperation policy.” And still, it’s not possible to actually pull off in practice, because you then have those cases like the one you just mentioned, where even if you ban “immigration enforcement practices” like making immigration-related arrests, basic public safety policing is going to still happen, whether that’s crowd control or traffic control. </p>\n\n<p>So when local police show up at an immigration home arrest or a worksite raid, they often become part of immigration enforcement by virtue of the fact that they’re there to protect pedestrians, route traffic, respond to violence or protect ICE agents. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll see this on social media, when protests rapidly form to surround ICE officers during raids. Police step in to assist ICE by protecting them as they haul someone away. This turns emergency assistance and crowd control into a form of immigration enforcement itself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Uniformed police officers push back a crowd of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">NYPD officers respond as protestors block a garage used by ICE vans ahead of a purported ICE raid on New York City’s Canal Street on Nov. 29, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/responds-as-immigration-activists-block-a-garage-used-by-news-photo/2248488235?adppopup=true\">Stephanie Keith/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Ultimately, when you get down into the procedural level of how you implement this stuff, it’s actually not possible to avoid cooperating. Complete non-cooperation and complete protection simply do not happen.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also seen local law enforcement agencies in sanctuary jurisdictions simply post all of their inmate information online. ICE agents can routinely check those databases and show up to arrest them once the inmates are released.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Under the George W. Bush administration, there was <a href=\"https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/miles/securecommunities\">the Secure Community program</a>, in which the Department of Homeland Security required local police to check the immigration status of anyone that they fingerprint. The Obama administration actually expanded this program. How have programs like this facilitated what you describe as a “professional kinship” between local police and federal agents?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, local police and federal agencies have different missions and different objectives, but they see themselves as being able to help each other accomplish their various goals.</p>\n\n<p>Many local police departments have long seen deportations as just another tool that they can use to get criminals off the street for good. Once they’ve arrested an undocumented person, they assume that if they’re deported, there won’t be an opportunity for them to return to the community to commit more crimes. And this view has been ingrained and reinforced through these collaborative partnerships like the Secure Communities program.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1982753636045443416&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, during the height of the Secure Communities program, (legal scholars) Adam Cox and Thomas Miles <a href=\"https://its.law.nyu.edu/faculty/profiles/representiveFiles/does_immigration_enforcement_reduce_crime_082514_94242D7E-F712-063A-64352391880DABF8.pdf\">conducted a statistical analysis</a> of 3,000 counties from 2005 to 2013 that assisted ICE by turning people over to them from local jails. </p>\n\n<p>They found, across the board, that crime in these counties didn’t decrease. It sounds counterintuitive. But when most people deported through jail transfers are people with low-level jail bookings – and not serious convictions – it makes more sense. It also doesn’t stop people who are part of a criminal enterprise from figuring out a way to get back into the country after being deported.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I want to go back to that term “sanctuary.” Opponents of sanctuary policies seem to have used it as a cudgel, and I think that’s because the layperson understands “sanctuary” as total protection. You obviously show that not to be the case. Have you seen elected officials avoiding the term?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around 2011 or 2012, officials started walking back the way they framed sanctuary policies. They were clearly sanctuary policies in terms of how they’d been crafted and what they attempt to do. But places like Chicago, for example, called theirs a “<a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/july_2012/mayor_emanuel_introduceswelcomingcityordinance.html\">Welcoming City” ordinance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These new terms emerged largely due to attacks by right-wing outlets such as Fox News and Breitbart. There was just a lot of bad press.</p>\n\n<p>And, yeah, politicians are running away from the term: I’ve heard different ones say, you know, “<a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2025/08/26/doj-letters-colorado-denver-immigration-policies/\">This is not a sanctuary policy</a>,” even though it’s been crafted using almost the exact same language as policies that are explicitly described as sanctuary policies.</p>\n\n<p>As I noted earlier, there was a time when activists and lawmakers thought these policies really were going to stop local jails and local police from helping to deport people. They just didn’t anticipate the durability of local-federal partnerships and their tenacity in finding ways to circumvent the intentions of lawmakers. </p>\n\n<p>I think over time – as the spirit of these policies continues to be violated by many local law enforcement officers – the term “sanctuary” has been used in more of an aspirational sense. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do local officers ever get disciplined for violating sanctuary policy?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/28-3-Mancina.pdf\">I actually studied this</a> – separate from the book – in San Francisco, where the police chief had issued a sanctuary city order. </p>\n\n<p>If an officer violates a local department order, it can go in their police file. These write-ups can add up and can lead to an actual firing under police union rules. </p>\n\n<p>In every single case where there was a violation of the sanctuary rules, the only thing that was issued was a verbal admonishment. So no write-ups. It’s the equivalent of someone saying, “Don’t do that again,” and leaving it at that.</p>\n\n<p>They knew their superiors were aware. So it was not nothing. In certain circumstances, those who had violated the order were told to go back to the San Francisco Police Academy for training on the sanctuary ordinance. </p>\n\n<p>But none of it went into their files. You could say it was a very lenient culture around those rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Returning to New Jersey: Was there any follow-up on whether local police departments were adhering to the Immigrant Trust Directive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So when the trust directive was implemented, the New Jersey attorney general’s office created training for all law enforcement officers. It was an online video that they had to watch. It was a few hours long. It was very technical. I watched it. Though some officers were allowed to do other work while watching, they all had to do it, and there was a very firm accounting of ensuring that every officer got that training.</p>\n\n<p>I also know that in the first year, they required local agencies to report back any instances of cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But after that first year, the follow-up seems to have stopped altogether. There were no further documented reports.</p>\n\n<p>I also managed a team of researchers that did a public records request of over 400 agencies across the state. I wanted to see whether local police departments had changed their policies to include the dictates of the Immigration Trust Directive. </p>\n\n<p>I was able to get access to records from 68% of all law enforcement agencies in the state. Of those, only 55% had actually changed their procedures so they were compliant with the Immigrant Trust Directive. Keep in mind, there were still pro-immigration enforcement procedures that were already on the books from Anne Milgram’s tenure (New Jersey’s attorney general from 2007 to 2010), when officers were encouraged to inquire about immigration status. It turns out many departments didn’t even tweak these internal policies and procedures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has stood out to you about the deportation efforts of the second Trump administration?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What’s happening are extensions of what’s been happening over the past few decades, in terms of the federal government looking to partner with different agencies at the local, state and federal levels, whether it’s sheriff’s departments, the ATF, the FBI or the Secret Service.</p>\n\n<p>But none of this coordination has ever happened to the degree we’re seeing right now. The administration is assigning people within these various agencies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/us/politics/dhs-agents-reassigned.html\">to do full-time immigration enforcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What’s been really amazing to me, too, has been the amplification of the 287(g) program. These are agreements signed with the Department of Homeland Security that permits local police officers to go out and find undocumented people to arrest and be potentially deported in the course of their everyday policing activities. So it allows them to double as a federal officer. </p>\n\n<p>At the start of 2025, <a href=\"https://lia-michigan.org/blog/police-and-immigration-enforcement/\">135 local law enforcement agencies</a> throughout the U.S. had signed these agreements. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/17/dhs-287g-reaches-more-1000-partnerships-state-and-local-enforcement-help-remove?\">Now over 1,000 agencies have signed on</a>. <a href=\"https://flsheriffs.org/blog/entry/florida-sheriffs-association-announces-287g-compliance-in-all-county-jails/\">Every single sheriff’s office in Florida</a> is currently under a 287(g) agreement. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Over the course of your 15 years studying sanctuary policing – either for this book or for your other studies – did you ever encounter instances where local police arrived at the scene of an ICE raid or an arrest and took the side of undocumented immigrants or citizens for one reason or another, whether that meant admonishing ICE agents for their aggressiveness or telling them, “Hey, you’re not following proper protocol.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, not a single time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269245/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n",

They use a variety of coercion and control techniques such as emotional abuse, <a href=\"https://cssh.northeastern.edu/crj/understanding-the-scope-and-nature-of-forced-criminality-in-the-united-states/\">forced criminality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/14/7/398\">financial abuse</a>, and physical and sexual abuse to entrap their victims. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the perpetrators are making money off their victims’ unpaid labor, including unwanted sex work. Human trafficking is estimated to be a <a href=\"https://ourrescue.org/resources/sex-trafficking/human-trafficking/human-trafficking-statistics/economics-of-human-trafficking\">US$172 billion industry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The story of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> is just one example of how traffickers use a combination of <a href=\"https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/force-fraud-and-coercion/\">manipulation, economic dependency and coercion</a> – rather than <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/human-trafficking-quick-facts\">physical captivity</a> – to entrap vulnerable people and slowly erode their autonomy. Many victims don’t even realize they’re being exploited due to the manipulations of their traffickers.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein’s crimes have attracted the national spotlight due to the fame and power of his clientele. His case demonstrates the harsh reality that human trafficking is far more common and complex than most people imagine.</p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SpCDf0IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">criminologists</a> who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Df9C-DwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">research human trafficking</a>. In 2020, we founded the University of South Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/cbcs/criminology/tip-lab/\">Trafficking in Persons Risk to Resilience Lab</a>, known as the TIP lab, to study human trafficking in the state of Florida.</p>\n\n<p>We know that labor and sex trafficking <a href=\"https://inourbackyard.org/the-issue/what-is-human-trafficking/\">hide in plain sight</a>, embedded in ordinary <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19389655231209698?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.7\">settings such as hotels</a>, <a href=\"https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/human-trafficking/recognizing-signs\">restaurants, farms, massage businesses</a> and private homes.</p>\n\n<p>Most victims are <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/the-misconceptions-of-child-trafficking/\">trafficked by someone they know or trust</a> – a family member, intimate partner or employer. Many continue to go to school or work <a href=\"https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/human-trafficking-americas-schools\">while being exploited</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Misconceptions about what trafficking looks like have made it harder to see and <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/human-trafficking-need-better-data\">harder to measure</a>. The available data on this crime and its victims has long been fragmented, incomplete and inconsistent. Law enforcement, government organizations such as health departments, and nonprofits that provide advocacy and victim services collect information differently. The same case could be counted multiple times by different agencies, while other victims go entirely uncounted, making it nearly impossible to understand the true scope of trafficking and effectively fight it.</p>\n\n<h2>Florida steps up</h2>\n\n<p>To address this problem, Florida in 2023 passed <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7064\">Senate Bill 7064</a>, a law requiring all state and local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations that receive federal or state funding to <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2023/governor-signs-bill-making-usf-trafficking-in-persons-lab-state-repository-for-human-trafficking-data.aspx\">send their human trafficking data</a> to the USF TIP lab.</p>\n\n<p>We developed TIPSTR, Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.usftiplab.org/statewide-data-repository/\">statewide repository for anonymous human trafficking data</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2025/usf-research-lab-releases-groundbreaking-report-on-the-high-prevalence-of-human-trafficking-in-florida.aspx\">single, consistent database</a> is the most comprehensive data resource on human trafficking in any state in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Our team compiled anonymous data from more than 30 state agencies and nonprofit organizations, including the <a href=\"https://www.myflfamilies.com/\">Florida Department of Children and Families</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/\">Florida Department of Law Enforcement</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.crisiscenter.com/\">Crisis Center of Tampa Bay</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We also conducted a self-report survey in 2024 to learn more about trafficking victims living in Florida. The survey was administered by <a href=\"https://yougov.com/en-us\">YouGov</a> using a representative sample of 2,500 Florida residents. And we established <a href=\"https://navigatewithbright.org/\">BRIGHT – Bridging Resources and Information Gaps in Human Trafficking</a> – which connects survivors directly with services such as housing, mental health counseling, transportation and more, helping them move from crisis to stability. Besides serving as a resource for trafficking victims, BRIGHT allows us to measure and track the availability of victim services relative to the need for them.</p>\n\n<p>Since starting TIPSTR in 2023, we’ve been putting all of the data together to create a picture of the complexities, depth and breadth of trafficking, as well as the resources that address the problem, both statewide and in each of Florida’s 67 counties.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man carries a bucket of tomatoes on his shoulders\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Florida’s agricultural industry attracts many migrant workers, who are vulnerable to being exploited.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/farm-labourer-carrying-bucket-of-tomatoes-on-royalty-free-image/981720-001?phrase=people%20walking%20in%20florida&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Wayne Eastep/The Image Bank via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why Florida faces higher risk</h2>\n\n<p>Florida’s economy and geography create a mix of risk factors for trafficking that are distinct from most other states.</p>\n\n<p>With its large <a href=\"https://www.mysuncoast.com/2025/11/26/florida-tourism-generated-1336-billion-2024-according-new-study/\">tourism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dolmanlaw.com/blog/human-trafficking-agriculture/\">agriculture</a>, <a href=\"https://researchhub.wttc.org/product/preventing-human-trafficking\">construction and entertainment industries</a>, the state depends heavily on <a href=\"https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking-on-temporary-work-visas-a-data-analysis-2015-2017/\">temporary and mobile workforces</a>. Its international airports and seaports connect it to global markets. Large sporting events and other entertainment bring in visitors looking for “fun in the sun” from all over the U.S. and the world.</p>\n\n<p>All of these features make Florida economically vibrant – <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/19190896/Human_Trafficking_in_Florida_The_Role_of_Applied_Anthropology_in_Addressing_the_Problem_and_Response\">but they also create vulnerabilities</a>. <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasp/resources/trafficking/dols-approach\">Transient labor markets, seasonal employment and high migration</a> make it easier for traffickers to exploit workers and harder for authorities to detect exploitation. Often, buyers travel into Florida as tourists with the idea that “what happens in Florida stays in Florida,” creating a market for sex trafficking.</p>\n\n<h2>What we’ve found so far</h2>\n\n<p>2024 was the first full year for which we collected data, and we published our findings in July 2025 in the <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3997/compressed_2024_TIPSTR_STATE_REPORT_ON_HUMAN_TRAFFICKING.pdf?1764019233\">2024 TIPSTR Report</a>. The report demonstrates both the scale of the problem and the importance of reliable data.</p>\n\n<p>The report also analyzes Florida counties with populations above 500,000, evaluating each county’s risk, resilience and response capacity on a scale from low to high.</p>\n\n<p>Our self-report survey found that an estimated 500,000 current Florida residents were exploited or trafficked at work, and an estimated 200,000 were trafficked for sex. Minors made up half of those trafficked for sex and a quarter of those exploited at work. Although many of these survivors were exploited outside of Florida, these people need services locally to help get their lives on track.</p>\n\n<p>Of those reporting human trafficking, only 9% to 12% reported this crime to law enforcement, confirming our concerns that it remains largely hidden from view. This is why it’s critical that TIPSTR doesn’t solely rely on law enforcement data.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis of the available data revealed wide variation across Florida counties in both the level of risk and the robustness of response systems. Some regions show strong resilience due to coordinated task forces and survivor services, while others struggle with underreporting and limited resources.</p>\n\n<h2>Translating data into action</h2>\n\n<p>At the same time, there are encouraging signs. The TIPSTR data shows prosecutions are increasing, and coordination among law enforcement, service providers and community organizations has strengthened.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, we hope our analysis of the data collected by TIPSTR will help the reporting agencies find new ways to respond. And tracking trends can allow policymakers to measure the effectiveness of programs run by different groups.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, this is already happening. One sheriff’s office shared with us that when it saw how many illicit massage businesses were in its county, it started investigating them. In another instance, a nonprofit told us it had used the report to show why it needs more funding to expand its programs.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing where trafficking is most concentrated and where services are missing is already helping the <a href=\"https://stophtfl.com/\">Florida Legislative Working Group on Human Trafficking</a> identify potential policy changes.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement can now use TIPSTR’s cross-agency data to connect cases. Service providers can coordinate care across counties, reducing duplication and ensuring continuity for survivors.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that the report will also be used to develop broader awareness campaigns and better victim identification practices.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of a long-term database</h2>\n\n<p>The system we’ve created will allow us to track the data for years to come. From a research perspective, this is critical, because it means our team can assess whether new policies and prevention strategies are making a measurable impact over time.</p>\n\n<p>As criminologists, we believe that what Florida has built through TIPSTR can serve as a model for other states. Data alone cannot end human trafficking, but without it, we are fighting a hidden problem we cannot fully see.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265935/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shelly M.

Across time, they also reveal the values each era chose to honor.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510318122\">study published in the journal</a> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we analyzed 38 million obituaries of Americans published from 1998 to 2024. We identified the values families most often highlight, and how those values shift across generations, regions and major historical events.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, working with psychologists <a href=\"https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/psychology-neuroscience/people/faculty-directory/liane-young.html\">Liane Young</a> and <a href=\"https://moralitylab.bc.edu/people/alumni/thomas-mazzuchi/\">Thomas Mazzuchi</a>, we examined the language used on <a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/\">Legacy.com</a>, an online platform where families often post obituaries and share memories of loved ones. </p>\n\n<p>During their lifetime, most people tend to be guided by a <a href=\"https://i2insights.org/2022/05/10/schwartz-theory-of-basic-values/\">small set of broad values</a> like caring for others, honoring tradition, keeping loved ones safe and seeking personal growth. To understand how these values showed up in remembrance, we used <a href=\"https://www.liwc.app/\">text-analysis tools</a> built on curated lists of everyday words people use when talking about those themes. </p>\n\n<p>By analyzing the words that appeared again and again in memorials, we could see which values communities chose to emphasize when looking back on the lives of their loved ones, and how those patterns changed over time. Because the dataset included 38 million obituaries, the analysis ran on a supercomputer. </p>\n\n<p>Across nearly 30 years of obituaries, words related to the value “tradition” appeared most often – many tributes described religious participation and enduring customs. Words related to the value “benevolence” – caring for the welfare of others – were also consistently prominent. In fact, tradition and benevolence formed the dominant value profile across the dataset: They appeared in more than 70% of the obituaries. By contrast, words related to values like “achievement” and “power” appeared far less often.</p>\n\n<p>Historical events did leave a mark. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the language families used to remember loved ones shifted compared with the period just before the attacks – and those shifts persisted for at least a year. Words related to the value “security” – including terms like “surviving,” “health” and “order” – showed up less often. At the same time, families used more language related to values like “benevolence” and “tradition.” Terms like “caring,” “loyal” and “service” showed up more often. These changes were especially strong in New York, where the attacks had the most direct impact. </p>\n\n<p>COVID-19, however, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.2510318122/asset/cdd39622-5240-4b1e-850b-a395268f6ac1/assets/images/large/pnas.2510318122fig05.jpg\">produced the most dramatic shifts</a>. Beginning in March 2020, benevolence-related language – including terms like “love,” “sympathy” and “family” – declined sharply, and hasn’t been the same since. Tradition-related language – terms like “service,” “faith” and “heritage” – initially declined as well, then rose above baseline levels during later stages of the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>These changes show that collective disruptions impact the moral vocabulary families use when commemorating loved ones. They shift what it means to have lived a good life.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw differences that reflect stereotypes about gender and age. Obituaries for men contained more language linked to achievement, conformity and power. Meanwhile, obituaries for women contained more language associated with benevolence and enjoying life’s pleasures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An elderly woman works on a laptop, looking grim, with a bouquet of flowers behind it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">There are notable differences in the values highlighted in obituaries of older versus younger adults.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/senior-woman-working-on-a-portable-computer-royalty-free-image/185248200?phrase=%20online%20obituary&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">AWelshLad/iStock / Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Older adults were often remembered more for valuing tradition. Younger adults, on the other hand, were often remembered more for valuing the welfare of all people and nature, and for being motivated to think and act independently. Value patterns in men’s obituaries shifted more across the lifespan than those in women’s. In other words, the values highlighted in younger and older men’s obituaries differed more from each other, while women’s value profiles stayed relatively consistent across age.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nna.org/obituaries-are-big-news-but-you-wouldnt-know-that-from-newspapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">The most visited</a> parts of print newspapers and online memorial sites, obituaries offer a window into what societies value at different points in time.</p>\n\n<p>This study contributes to the broader <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2022.101005\">scientific understanding of legacy</a>. People often hold strong preferences about how they want to be remembered, but far less is known about how they actually are remembered, in part because large-scale evidence about real memorials is rare. Our analysis of millions of obituaries helps fill that gap. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Obituaries allow researchers to trace cultural values across time, geography and social groups. Future work can examine differences across race and occupation, as well as across regions. It could also look to earlier periods using historical obituary archives, such as those preserved in older newspapers and local records.</p>\n\n<p>Another direction is to examine whether highlighting how often kindness shows up in obituaries could inspire people to be more caring in daily life.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what endures in memory helps clarify what people consider meaningful; those values shape how they choose to live.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263880/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This is the flagship designation of the National Park Service system, which includes many types of properties in addition to formally designated national parks.</p>\n\n<p>Although this <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2025/12/national-park-subcommittee-to-receive-testimony-on-pending-legislation\">redesignation</a> may not include much change for the site itself, it could mean quite a lot to visitors, supporters and locals alike.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/news/acquisition-more-than-doubles-the-size-of-ocmulgee-mounds-national-historical-park.htm\">3,000-acre park</a> protects land and features important to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/historyculture/mississippian-culture.htm\">Mississippian culture</a>, which built the mounds there starting roughly 3,000 years ago, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, for which the site is an ancestral homeland.</p>\n\n<p>The site includes <a href=\"https://traveltheparks.com/journey-through-time-ocmulgee-mounds/\">seven enormous ceremonial and burial mounds made of earth</a>, the largest of which is 55 feet (15 meters) tall and covers about 2 acres, as well as a museum containing <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/ocmulgee-mounds-national-historical-park\">millions of cultural artifacts</a>, including pottery, stone tools, jewelry and bells.</p>\n\n<p>The National Park Service has <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/management/upload/OCMU_FD_2014_508.pdf\">managed the site since the 1930s</a>, first as a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/archeology/national-monument-facts-and-figures.htm\">national monument</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/47/text\">since 2019</a>, as a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">national historical park</a>. There are no legal or practical differences in protection between these redesignations, though the branding and marketing of the site may change.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/sethkannarr/\">geographer</a> who studies parks and the naming of places, I have seen that when a National Park Service unit is redesignated as a national park, as a pending <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2345\">bill in Congress currently proposes</a> for Ocmulgee Mounds, it does not typically change the funding available to run the site. That’s especially true at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/28/us-national-parks-trumps\">National Park Service funding and personnel are being cut</a>. However, a park redesignation does serve political purposes and affects how visitors perceive that park.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26609838/embed\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26609838/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/26609838\" target=\"_top\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\"> </a></div>\n\n<h2>How parks are designated</h2>\n\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm\">manages 433 units</a> with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">19 different designations</a>, such as “national battlefields,” “national lakeshores” and “national scenic trails.” Only <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm\">63 of these units</a> carry the formal title or designation of “national park.”</p>\n\n<p>All but one of these categories can be bestowed only by Congress. National monuments, however, can be created by the president directly, under the provisions of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/national-monuments-have-grown-and-shrunk-under-us-presidents-for-over-a-century-thanks-to-one-law-the-antiquities-act-252707\">Antiquities Act of 1906</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Antiquities Act allowed President Barack Obama to designate 1.3 million acres in Utah as <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/28/proclamation-establishment-bears-ears-national-monument\">Bears Ears National Monument</a> in a December 2016 proclamation. That same act allowed President Donald Trump to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/08/deb-haaland-bears-ears-national-monument\">shrink the protected area to 200,000 acres</a> in 2017 – and President Joe Biden to <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/08/a-proclamation-on-bears-ears-national-monument/\">re-expand it to 1.3 million acres</a> in 2021.</p>\n\n<h2>Other examples of redesignation</h2>\n\n<p>In rare cases, a community, group or other organization proposes adding an area that is not currently managed by the National Park Service to the system, but this <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RS20158\">takes a lot of time</a> and is different from the more common process of changing the formal designation of a property already within the system.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm\">Indiana Dunes National Park</a> in 2019. That same year, White Sands National Monument in New Mexico became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm\">White Sands National Park</a>.

But the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ128/PLAW-115publ128.pdf\">law that formalized the change</a> included no additional funding, resources or protections for the Gateway Arch.</p>\n\n<p>Changing the designation contradicted the park service’s own declaration that the term “national park” should be used for an area that “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">contains a variety of resources</a> and encompasses large land or water areas to help provide adequate protection of the resources.” </p>\n\n<p>During congressional hearings, the deputy director of the National Park Service, Robert Vogel, recommended the site not be labeled a national park but rather a national monument, because the site “<a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/ocl/s-1438\">is too small and limited</a> in the range of resources the site protects and interprets to be called a national park.”</p>\n\n<p>Gateway Arch National Park is now the smallest-area park in the U.S., at less than 200 acres, and is home to a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/the-significance-of-the-gateway-arch-landscape.htm\">large steel arch, an open lawn area, a museum and a single historic building</a> – a courthouse where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/och.htm\">one of the Dred Scott trials</a> was heard, along with other civil rights cases. It does not have the wildlife viewing, spectacular geologic features, outdoor recreation opportunities and sense of wilderness that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-74653-6_8\">the public has come to expect from national parks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The park’s website admits “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/learn/nature/plants.htm\">it is unusual for a national park to have no natural plant life</a>” and describes the park as adjacent to the “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/learn/nature/animals.htm\">concrete jungle of downtown St. Louis</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What actually would change for Ocmulgee Mounds?</h2>\n\n<p>The redesignation effort for Ocmulgee Mounds has two primary aspects. First, it would declare the area a national park.</p>\n\n<p>Second, it would add additional land to this protected area, designating that portion as a national preserve. The distinction matters: Public hunting, including traditional Indigenous hunting, is not allowed in national parks, but it is allowed in national preserves. And while national parks are managed by the National Park Service under the Department of Interior, national preserves can be <a href=\"https://cepp.stanford.edu/focal-areas/wildfire-climate-resilience/tribal-stewardship-and-management-national-park-service\">managed in collaborative partnership</a> with other groups, including local Indigenous people with cultural ties to the land.</p>\n\n<p>The changes for Ocmulgee Mounds are supported by members of <a href=\"https://www.macon.com/news/environment/article312215663.html\">both political parties in both houses of Congress</a>. And the redesignation does not appear to have triggered <a href=\"https://www.njherald.com/story/news/environment/2024/04/21/delaware-water-gap-national-park-why-nj-legislators-are-fighting-it/73404753007/\">opposition from local communities</a>, who in other places have objected for several reasons, including fear of increased tourism and desire to <a href=\"https://scarab.bates.edu/honorstheses/181/\">preserve any long-standing uses of the land</a> that would be banned if it were to become a national park.</p>\n\n<p>There are redesignation efforts underway seeking to make national parks in other locations as well, including the <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/delaware-water-gap-national-park/\">Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area</a> in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/arizona-national-monument-converting-into-a-national-park-is-getting-mixed-reactions/\">Chiricahua National Monument</a> in Arizona, <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/americas-first-national-river-could-be-the-next-new-national-park-in-the-us/\">Buffalo National River</a> in Arkansas, and <a href=\"https://tiffany.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-tiffany-reintroduces-bill-create-wisconsins-first-national-park\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a> in Wisconsin.</p>\n\n<p>The only real changes in these places, though, would be in marketing – the signs, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/hfc/a-brief-history-of-the-unigrid.htm\">brochures</a> and merchandise sold in gift shops. But these changes would have an important effect: The tagline of “new national park” <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/public-lands/protected-lands/national-monuments-redesignated-national-parks/\">markets well</a> and is believed to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41816\">help attract more visitors</a> to the site. But it won’t actually protect these landscapes any better than they already are under the stewardship of the National Park Service.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268474/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Seth T.

Six organizations were also indicted, including the Gestapo and the SS. The tribunal, which took place in Nuremberg, Germany, and resulted in 19 convictions, <a href=\"https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Reporting_the_Nuremberg_Trials.html?id=EOOw0AEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">attracted worldwide media attention</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Eighty years later, you’ll hear terms like “war crimes” and “genocide” be deployed and debated – whether they’re applied to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/30/war-crimes-hegseth-venezuela-strikes-00671160\">use of military force in the Caribbean</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">Israel’s destruction of the Gaza Strip</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The public’s understanding of these terms is due, in large part, to the success of the Nuremberg trials and the remarkable degree of international cooperation they required. But the shakiness of international justice today, along with the ongoing complexity of legal and moral conceptions of guilt, shows the limits of the law when it comes to holding the worst of the worst accountable.    </p>\n\n<h2>Not the first attempt at international justice</h2>\n\n<p>These trials were not the first effort to prosecute war crimes in an international court. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Leipzig_Trials/XjbkrQEACAAJ?hl=en\">1921 Leipzig war crimes trials</a> took place to take legal action against Germans accused of war crimes in World War I. These trials, however, were stymied by <a href=\"https://www.historians.org/resource/what-happened-after-the-last-war/\">practical and procedural issues</a>, including <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1919Parisv13/ch16subch1\">difficulty bringing the accused to court</a> and locating evidence. They ultimately led to only six convictions – accompanied by light sentences – and even some of those were later overturned.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of man with mustache wearing a suit and tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of War Henry L.

Some officials, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/2617836\">such as U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson</a>, argued in favor of trials that adhered closely to American legal principles. Others, like British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, objected, <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691092782/stay-the-hand-of-vengeance?srsltid=AfmBOooY83seEosY4SYyMpNnYGC1Id5pcMtkkY6E2FF3I7JGGpMBdTRm\">specifically citing the failure of the Leipzig trials</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But several aspects were different this time around. </p>\n\n<p>When the four chief prosecutors of the International Military Tribunal, representing the U.K., U.S., USSR and France, <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/count.asp\">filed the indictment for the Nuremberg trials</a>, most of the accused were already in custody. The prosecuting attorneys also had access to <a href=\"https://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/\">a trove of Nazi documents</a> to build their cases. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, beyond a <a href=\"https://www.roberthjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Justice_Jackson_s_Final_Report.pdf\">remarkable degree of cooperation</a> among those four nations, there was considerable public interest in and support for the trials. <a href=\"https://libsysdigi.library.uiuc.edu/OCA/Books2009-07/publicopinionino00merr/publicopinionino00merr.pdf\">Even swaths of the German public championed them</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>New categories for crimes</h2>\n\n<p>There still needed to be a solid legal basis for the trials. Some defendants argued that their actions, at the time, had been legal under German law. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, the charter that established the International Military Tribunal represented a significant development by outlining and defining the specific crimes that would fall under its jurisdiction: <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf\">war crimes, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>While the category of war crimes was based on <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/lawwar.asp\">existing international conventions</a>, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity had not been previously codified.</p>\n\n<p>The International Military Tribunal proceedings began on Nov. 20, 1945, and the hearings lasted until Sept. 1, 1946. Four judges – one from each of the countries convening the tribunal – presided over the case. Each of the four convening countries also appointed a chief prosecutor to lead the prosecution. Defendants were allowed to select their own legal counsel, <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3566&amp;context=jclc\">subject to the court’s approval</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 1, 1946, after a month of deliberation, <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/10-01-46.asp\">the judges issued the final rulings</a>. Of the 22 individual defendants, 19 were found guilty, 12 of whom were sentenced to death.</p>\n\n<h2>Blind spots</h2>\n\n<p>One notable detail of <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtchart.asp\">the agreement</a> that established the International Military Tribunal was the stipulation that it would be used to punish “<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf\">the major war criminals of the European Axis</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Atrocities committed by Allied forces, however, were not subject to the court’s scrutiny as possible war crimes, nor were actions taken by Allied governments domestically, including the <a href=\"https://densho.org/\">incarceration of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/visiting/exhibitions/harlanfiskestone/Section4.aspx\">Harlan Fiske Stone</a> expressed misgivings about the legal precedent he saw the trials setting. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/harlanfiskestone0000maso\">In a letter</a> discussing International Military Tribunal chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson – who, at the time, was Stone’s colleague on the Supreme Court – Stone lamented, “I don’t mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law.”</p>\n\n<p>Questions about the complicity of everyday German citizens and those in Nazi-occupied territories were also left unresolved.

It was the “massed angered forces of common humanity.” </p>\n\n<p>In the 80 years since, the world has witnessed countless conflicts and atrocities unfold across the globe, yet only a relatively small number of the alleged perpetrators have been tried before international courts.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond staunch disagreement over how to stop them, you’ll see debates over whether they even constitute crimes in the first place. The legitimacy of international courts is also disputed: In August 2025, the U.S. – which does not belong to the International Criminal Court – <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/icc-strongly-rejects-new-us-sanctions-against-judges-and-deputy-prosecutors\">imposed sanctions on ICC officials</a> after the court issued arrest warrants against top Israeli officials over alleged crimes in Gaza. </p>\n\n<p>Watching “Nuremberg” in light of Stimson’s claim, you might wonder how to view this current moment vis-à-vis this earlier era. </p>\n\n<p>Have political and social conditions shifted to such an extent that appealing to the “forces of common humanity” is no longer a viable political strategy? Or is the takeaway that there is always value in endeavoring to cultivate some form of consensus – no matter how small – over whether certain lines can never be crossed?</p>\n\n<p>Even if consensus remains elusive, one thing is clear: The world’s knowledge of terms like “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” provides a universally understood way to push back against unfolding atrocities.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269263/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>B.B.

The kidney had been engineered to mimic human tissue and was grown in a pig, as an alternative to waiting around for a human organ donor who might never come. For decades, this idea lived at the edge of science fiction. Now <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">it’s on the table</a>, literally.</p>\n\n<p>The patient is one of six taking part in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-xenotransplant-addc5a8b6a09d73e021efc9c8eafabc9\">first clinical trial of pig-to-human kidney transplants</a>. The goal: to see whether gene-edited pig kidneys can safely replace failing human ones.</p>\n\n<p>A decade ago, scientists were chasing a different solution. Instead of editing the genes of pigs to make their organs human-friendly, they tried to grow human organs – made entirely of human cells – inside pigs. But in 2015 the <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-158.html\">National Institutes of Health paused funding</a> for that work to consider its ethical risks. The pause remains today.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gApV_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">bioethicist and philosopher</a> who has spent years studying the ethics of using organs grown in animals – including serving on an NIH-funded national working group examining oversight for research on human-animal chimeras – I was perplexed by the decision. The ban assumed the danger was making pigs too human. Yet regulators now seem comfortable making humans a little more pig.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it considered ethical to put pig organs in humans but not to grow human organs in pigs?</p>\n\n<h2>Urgent need drives xenotransplantation</h2>\n\n<p>It’s easy to overlook the desperation driving these experiments. More than 100,000 Americans are <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics#\">waiting for organ transplants</a>. Demand overwhelms supply, and thousands die each year before one becomes available. </p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">looked across species for help</a> – from baboon hearts in the 1960s to genetically altered pigs today. The challenge has always been the immune system. The body treats cells it does not recognize as part of itself as invaders. As a result, it destroys them.</p>\n\n<p>A recent case underscores this fragility. A man in New Hampshire <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-xenotransplant-dialysis-7bb8dcc1a2e02bc16a9a27ef8071ee64\">received a gene-edited pig kidney</a> in January 2025. Nine months later, it had to be removed because its function was declining. While this partial success gave scientists hope, it was also a reminder that rejection remains a central problem for transplanting organs across species, also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">known as xenotransplantation</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OmAUHpsRw0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Decades of research have led to the first clinical trial of pig kidney transplants.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Researchers are attempting to work around transplant rejection by creating an organ the human body might tolerate, inserting a few human genes and deleting some pig ones. Still, recipients of these gene-edited pig organs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.899657\">need powerful drugs to suppress the immune system</a> both during and long after the transplant procedure, and even this may not prevent rejection. Even human-to-human transplants <a href=\"https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/living-with-a-kidney-transplant/kidney-transplant-medicines/\">require lifelong immunosuppressants</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why another approach – <a href=\"https://stanmed.stanford.edu/caution-surrounds-research-into-growing-human-organs-in-animals/\">growing organs from a patient’s own cells</a> – looked promising. This involved disabling the genes that let pig embryos form a kidney and injecting human stem cells into the embryo to fill the gap where a kidney would be. As a result, the pig embryo would grow a kidney genetically matched to a future patient, theoretically eliminating the risk of rejection.</p>\n\n<p>Although simple in concept, the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6153627/\">execution is technically complex</a> because human and pig cells develop at different speeds. Even so, five years prior to the NIH ban, researchers had already done something similar by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.039\">growing a mouse pancreas inside a rat</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-species organ growth was not a fantasy – it was a working proof of concept.</p>\n\n<h2>Ethics of creating organs in other species</h2>\n\n<p>The worries motivating the NIH ban in 2015 on inserting human stem cells into animal embryos did not come from concerns about scientific failure but rather from moral confusion. </p>\n\n<p>Policymakers feared that human cells might spread through the animal’s body – even into its brain – and in so doing blur the line between human and animal. The NIH warned of possible “<a href=\"https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/QA_Chimera_Policy_updated_1_Feb_2017.pdf\">alterations of the animal’s cognitive state</a>.” The Animal Legal Defense Fund, an animal advocacy organization, argued that if such chimeras gained humanlike awareness, they <a href=\"https://aldf.org/article/animal-legal-defense-fund-urges-national-institutes-of-health-to-recognize-rights-of-humanized-animals/\">should be treated as human research subjects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The worry centers on the possibility that an animal’s <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/grounds-moral-status/\">moral status</a> – that is, the degree to which an entity’s interests matter morally and the level of protection it is owed – might change. Higher moral status requires better treatment because it comes with vulnerability to greater forms of harm. </p>\n\n<p>Think of the harm caused by poking an animal that’s sentient compared to the harm caused by poking an animal that’s self-conscious. A sentient animal – that is, one capable of experiencing sensations such as pain or pleasure – would sense the pain and try to avoid it. In contrast, an animal that’s self-conscious – that is, one capable of reflecting on having those experiences – would not only sense the pain but grasp that it is itself the subject of that pain. The latter kind of harm is deeper, involving not just sensation but awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the NIH’s concern is that if human cells migrate into an animal’s brain, they might introduce new forms of experience and suffering, thereby elevating its moral status.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of piglets moving between bars\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">How human do pigs need to be for them to be considered part of the human species?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ProducingPigOrgans/4c584661922c49eb8c587887c8d187d9/photo\">AP Photo/Shelby Lum</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The flawed logic of the NIH ban</h2>\n\n<p>However, the reasoning behind the NIH’s ban is faulty. If certain cognitive capacities, such as self-consciousness, conferred higher moral status, then it follows that regulators would be equally concerned about inserting dolphin or primate cells into pigs as they are about inserting human cells. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2013.868951\">They are not</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, the moral circle of beings whose interests matter is drawn <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105139\">not around self-consciousness but around species membership</a>. Regulators protect all humans from harmful research because they are human, not because of their specific cognitive capacities such as the ability to feel pain, use language or engage in abstract reasoning. In fact, many people lack such capacities. Moral concern flows from that relationship, not from having a particular form of awareness. No research goal can <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/science-requires-ethical-oversight-without-federal-dollars-societys-health-and-safety-are-at-risk-252794\">justify violating the most basic interests</a> of human beings.</p>\n\n<p>If a pig embryo infused with human cells truly became something close enough to count as a member of the human species, then current research regulations would dictate it’s owed human-level regard. But the mere presence of human cells doesn’t make pigs humans.</p>\n\n<p>The pigs engineered for kidney transplants already carry human genes, but they aren’t called half-human beings.

On one recent weekend, I headed to the chimpanzees first.</p>\n\n<p>Their breakfast was still scattered around their enclosure for them to find. Ripley, one of the male chimpanzees, quickly gathered up some fruits and vegetables, sometimes using his feet almost like hands. After he ate, he used his feet to grab the fire hoses hanging around the enclosure and even held pieces of straw and other toys in his toes.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself feeling a bit envious. Why can’t people use our feet like this, quickly and easily grasping things with our toes just as easily as we do with our fingers? </p>\n\n<p>I’m a biological anthropologist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oohs4RcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">studies the biomechanics of the modern human foot and ankle</a>, using mechanical principles of movement to understand how forces affect the shape of our bodies and how humans have changed over time. Your muscles, brain and how human feet evolved all play a part in why you can’t wiggle individual toes one by one.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"young chimp running on all fours\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chimpanzee hands and feet do similar jobs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/male-chimpanzee-youngster-royalty-free-image/169726893\">Manoj Shah/Stone via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Comparing humans to a close relative</h2>\n\n<p>Humans are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/primate-mammal\">primates</a>, which means we belong to the same group of animals that includes apes like Riley the chimp.

But over time our lineage started <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright\">walking on two legs</a>. Human feet needed to change to help us stay balanced and to support our bodies as we walk upright.

Over time, our fingers became better at moving on their own. People use their hands to do lots of things, such as drawing, texting or playing a musical instrument. Even typing this article is possible only because my fingers can make small, careful and controlled movements.</p>\n\n<p>People’s feet and hands evolved for different purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>Muscles that move your fingers or toes</h2>\n\n<p>Evolution brought these differences about by physically adapting our muscles, bones and tendons to better support walking and balance. Hands and feet have similar anatomy; both have five fingers or toes that are moved by muscles and tendons. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539705/\">human foot contains 29 muscles</a> that all work to help you walk and stay balanced when you stand. In comparison, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279362/\">hand has 34 muscles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the muscles of your foot let you point your toes down, like when you stand on tiptoes, or lift them up, like when you walk on your heels. These muscles also help feet roll slightly inward or outward, which lets you keep your balance on uneven ground. All these movements work together to help you walk and run safely. </p>\n\n<p>The big toe on each foot is special because it helps push your body forward when you walk and has extra muscles just for its movement. The other four toes don’t have their own separate muscles. A few main muscles in the bottom of your foot and in your calf move all four toes at once. Because they share muscles, those toes can wiggle, but not very independently like your fingers can. The calf muscles also have long tendons that reach into the foot; they’re better at keeping you steady and helping you walk than at making tiny, precise movements.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a pen and ink drawing of the interior anatomy of a human hand\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Your hand is capable of delicate movements thanks to the muscles and ligaments that control its bones.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray427.png\">Henry Gray, 'Anatomy of the Human Body'/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In contrast, six main muscle groups help move each finger. The fingers share these muscles, which sit mostly in the forearm and connect to the fingers by tendons. The thumb and pinky have extra muscles that let you grip and hold objects more easily. All of these muscles are specialized to allow careful, controlled movements, such as writing.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, I have more muscles dedicated to moving my fingers, but that is not the only reason I can’t wiggle my toes one by one.</p>\n\n<h2>Divvying up brain power</h2>\n\n<p>You also need to look inside your brain to understand why toes and fingers work differently. Part of your brain called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03460-4\">motor cortex</a> tells your body how to move. It’s made of cells called neurons that act like tiny messengers, sending signals to the rest of your body.</p>\n\n<p>Your motor cortex devotes many more neurons to controlling your fingers than your toes, so it can send much more detailed instructions to your fingers. Because of the way your motor cortex is organized, it takes more “brain power,” meaning more signals and more activity, to move your fingers than your toes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"illustration of a brain looking down at the top of the head with one section highlighted orange\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The motor cortex of your brain sends orders to move parts of your body.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/human-brain-with-highlighted-precentral-royalty-free-illustration/1316975491\">Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even though you can’t grab things with your feet like Ripley the chimp can, you can understand why. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

And foreign policy types with axes to grind have been making good use of this other meaning, too.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, academic Walter Russell Mead <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-war-of-revision-is-coming-russia-china-taiwan-national-security-4e2184a7?mod=article_inline\">warned in his Wall Street Journal column</a> of the threat from the “axis of revisionist powers” – namely China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.</p>\n\n<p>The same grouping has gone by other names, too: the “<a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/axis-of-upheaval\">axis of upheaval</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/hauser-symposium-axis-autocracies\">axis of autocracies</a>” among them.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.macalester.edu/political-science/facultystaff/andrewlatham/\">scholar of international relations</a>, I know that framing any coalition or grouping as an “axis” does more than merely describe — it does some serious geopolitical work. The term summons the memory of the original “axis,” that of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/axis-powers-world-war-ii\">Axis powers of World War II</a>. </p>\n\n<p>What it attempts to do is cast any named grouping of countries as similarly dangerous, duplicitous or degenerate. To call a group of nations an “axis” is to situate them in a lineage of villainy, transforming today’s rivalries into an echo of that original alliance.</p>\n\n<h2>The origins of the ‘axis’</h2>\n\n<p>The naming of today’s “axes” tends to come out of think tanks and foreign policy institutions of the U.S. But the origin story begins not in Washington, but in Rome. </p>\n\n<p>In 1936, Italy’s fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed that a “<a href=\"https://www.e-ir.info/2011/07/29/hitler-and-mussolini-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-rome-berlin-axis-1936-1940/\">Rome–Berlin Axis</a>” would divide Europe, constituting a geopolitical line around which other countries would orbit.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"A drawing of a samurai standing over destroyed boats with flags behind him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A propaganda poster for the original ‘axis’ – Italy, Germany and Japan.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patto_Tripartito.jpg\">Gino Boccasile, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By the time of World War II, the term “<a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/axis-powers-world-war-ii\">Axis powers</a>” had come to refer to the military coalition of Germany, Italy and Japan. In that historical context, the word “axis,” from the perspective of nations outside that group, carried connotations of unity, threat and evil from the offset.</p>\n\n<p>The term fell largely into disuse with the Axis powers’ defeat in 1945. </p>\n\n<p>That was until U.S. President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://fpif.org/deconstructing_george_w_bush_a_critical_analysis_of_the_2002_state_of_the_union_address/\">famously revived the word</a> after the Sept. 11 attacks. The “axis” he referenced in his 2002 State of the Union address wasn’t an existing alliance. Rather, he was creating one in the public imagination: an “axis of evil.”</p>\n\n<p>The three countries Bush named in that group – Iran, Iraq and North Korea – had little in common, beyond Washington’s suspicion. Yet by linking them under a single, ominous label, Bush transformed three separate challengers into a unified menace. </p>\n\n<p>The phrase “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4629258-thehill-com-opinion-international-4629258-axis-of-evil-iran-north-korea-china-russia-america/\">axis of evil</a>” was never meant to map reality; it was meant to shape it by fusing disparate adversaries into a single moral and strategic category.</p>\n\n<h2>From one metaphor to another</h2>\n\n<p>From Bush’s revival, the idea of axes took on a life of its own. Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar, a Libyan daily newspaper, retorted that in reality, <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1007/978-3-030-45465-4_4\">Bush’s targets comprised an “axis of resistance</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Iranian leaders and their allies picked that term up and reworked it to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-much-influence-does-iran-have-over-its-proxy-axis-of-resistance-hezbollah-hamas-and-the-houthis-221269\">apply to a network of aligned armed movements</a> across the Middle East, including the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>What had been a Western accusation was transformed into a badge of honor for those who defined themselves as resisting American hegemony and Israeli occupation.</p>\n\n<p>But it was the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 that revived the use of “axis” in the imagination of Washington analysts.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2024 article for Foreign Affairs, former U.S. foreign policy officials Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Richard Fontaine warned of an “<a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine\">axis of upheaval</a>” dedicated to “overturning the principles, rules and institutions that underlie the prevailing international system.”</p>\n\n<p>The four countries in this “axis” – China, Iran, North Korea and Russia – have little formal coordination. But the phrase captured something about mood and moment: the sense that the world is tilting toward multipolar rivalry and systemic friction.</p>\n\n<h2>Words that make worlds</h2>\n\n<p>Calling a coalition an “axis” is never a neutral act – it <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/force-isnt-only-way-to-confront-axis/\">is a political label</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It can transform separate grievances into one unified struggle, or it can reduce a complex relationship to an “us versus them” or “good versus evil” frame. </p>\n\n<p>The effect is double-edged. On the one hand, such language can be useful for mobilizing public opinion and bringing a sense of threat into focus. On the other, it makes categories more rigid and diplomacy harder. Once a nation has been put on an “axis” list, engagement can become morally freighted, and compromise can be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/585998-learning-the-real-lessons-of-neville-chamberlains-appeasement/\">framed as appeasement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The “axis of evil” label, for instance, helped make possible the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but it made talks with Iran and North Korea politically toxic for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Whether “evil,” “resistance” or “upheaval,” each variant of the “axis” metaphor tells us something about the way that political language constructs the world it describes. </p>\n\n<p>When we talk about an “axis,” we are not just mapping alliances in the world. We are also helping to define the moral geography of global politics — and deciding who stands inside the circle of legitimacy, and who stands outside it.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article is part of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/foreign-policy-101-171483\">series explaining foreign policy terms</a> commonly used but rarely explained.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268146/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andrew Latham does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",
