Increasingly, consumers are <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032853/what-does-protein-powder-do/\">using these protein sources daily</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A new study by Consumer Reports, published on Oct. 14, 2025, claims that some such protein products <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?msockid=078a1cc015a3675f3a180ab914aa660b\">contain dangerously high levels of lead</a>, as well as other heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic. At high levels, these substances have serious, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23424-heavy-metal-poisoning-toxicity\">well-documented health risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/\">clinical pharmacologist</a> who has evaluated the heavy metal content of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/parents-can-soon-use-qr-codes-to-reveal-heavy-metal-content-in-baby-food-247579\">baby food</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280211023328\">calcium supplements</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2024.2395552\">kratom products</a>. Lead and other heavy metals <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/epa-has-lowered-the-screening-level-for-lead-in-soil-heres-what-that-could-mean-for-households-across-the-us-224609\">occur naturally in soil and water</a>, so achieving zero-level exposure would be impossible. Additionally, the level of lead exposure that Consumer Reports deems safe is significantly lower than those set by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n\n<p>However, regardless of the safety cutoff, the study does show that a few products are delivering a concerningly high dose of heavy metals per serving.</p>\n\n<h2>How Consumer Reports did the study</h2>\n\n<p>The new study assessed 23 <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?msockid=078a1cc015a3675f3a180ab914aa660b\">powder and ready-to-drink</a> protein products from popular brands by sending three samples of each product to an independent commercial laboratory.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer Reports considered anything over <a href=\"https://article.images.consumerreports.org/image/upload/v1760108748/prod/content/dam/CRO-Images-2025/Special%20Projects/Consumer-Reports-Protein-Powders-and-Shakes-Contain-High-Levels-of-Lead-Methodology-Test-Results.pdf\">0.5 micrograms per day</a> from any single source to be above recommended maximum lead levels. That number comes from the <a href=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/\">California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</a>, which established recommended maximum levels for a variety of substances that could cause cancer or fetal harm. </p>\n\n<p>It is significantly more conservative than the safety standard for lead exposure used by the FDA for drugs and supplements. The discrepancy is driven by Consumer Reports’ aspirational goals of very low exposure versus the more realistic but actionable requirements from the FDA.</p>\n\n<p>According to the FDA, the limit for the amount of lead that a person should consume from any single dietary supplement product <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/98847/download\">is 5 micrograms per day</a>. That number is 10 times higher than the Consumer Report limit. </p>\n\n<p>The FDA has another standard for the total daily amount of lead a person can safely consume from  food, drugs and supplements combined. This number, called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105202\">Interim Reference Level, or IRL, for lead</a> is based on concentrations of lead in the blood that are associated with negative health effects in different populations. </p>\n\n<p>For people who could become pregnant, that level is 8.8 micrograms per day, and for children it’s 2.2 micrograms per day. For everyone else, it’s 12.5 micrograms per day. Every food, drug and dietary supplement that contains lead contributes to the total daily exposure, which should be less than this amount.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Bodybuilder at the gym drinking a protein shake\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696832/original/file-20251016-56-6yjuhe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In assessing lead levels, Consumer Reports used a more conservative safety standard than the one used by the FDA for drugs and supplements.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/bodybuilder-drinking-or-taking-protein-powder-and-royalty-free-image/1369897745\">lakshmiprasad S/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What the report found</h2>\n\n<p>The nonprofit advocacy group found that 16 of the 23 products it tested exceeded 0.5 micrograms, the level of lead in a standard serving that the organization deems safe.</p>\n\n<p>Four of the 23 products exceeded 2.2 micrograms, the FDA’s cutoff for the total daily amount of lead children should consume. Two products contained 72% and 88%, respectively, of the total daily amount of lead that the FDA deems safe for pregnant women.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Consumer Reports found that two of the 23 products delivered more than what it considers a safe amount of cadmium per serving, and one had more arsenic than was recommended. </p>\n\n<p>The organization’s safety cutoff for cadmium is 4.1 micrograms per day, and for arsenic it is 7 micrograms per day. These numbers align fairly closely with the FDA’s recommended exposure limit for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/98847/download\">cadmium and arsenic from a single product</a>. For cadmium, the FDA’s limit is set at 5 micrograms per day for a given dietary supplement product and 15 micrograms per day for arsenic.</p>\n\n<p>The study found that the source of protein was key: Plant-derived protein products had nine times the lead found in dairy proteins like whey, and twice as much as beef-based protein.</p>\n\n<h2>Where are these heavy metals coming from?</h2>\n\n<p>Lead and other heavy metals are present in high amounts in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10070398\">volcanic rock</a>, which comes from molten rock called magma beneath the Earth’s surface. When volcanic rock is eroded, the heavy metals contaminate the local soil and water supply. What’s more, some crop plants are especially efficient at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107169\">extracting heavy metals</a> from the soil and placing them in the parts of the plants that consumers ingest.</p>\n\n<p>Fossil fuels, which come from deep within the Earth, also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04691\">billow heavy metals into the air when they are burned</a>. These substances then settle out into the soil and water. Finally, some <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics9030042\">fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides</a> also contain heavy metals that can further contaminate soil and local water. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of heavy metals have been found in plant-based protein powder, spices like <a href=\"https://www.consumerlab.com/news/caution-with-cinnamon/12-11-2020/\">cinnamon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/lead-and-cadmium-in-dark-chocolate-a8480295550/\">dark chocolate</a>, root vegetables like <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/parents-can-soon-use-qr-codes-to-reveal-heavy-metal-content-in-baby-food-247579\">carrots and sweet potatoes,</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218128\">rice</a>, <a href=\"https://medshun.com/article/does-organic-pea-protein-contain-less-heavy-metals-than-conventional\">legumes such as pea pods</a> and many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019900504\">herbal supplements</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A cast iron pot of cubed sweet potatoes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696823/original/file-20251016-56-kt932j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Root vegetables such as sweet potatoes can absorb heavy metals from the soil.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/37922399@N05/8713539143\">Virginia State Parks</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Should consumers be concerned? And what can they do?</h2>\n\n<p>Occasionally exceeding the daily recommended heavy metal doses is unlikely to result in serious health issues. </p>\n\n<p>Repeated, heavy exposure to heavy metals can cause harm, however. When they <a href=\"https://www.gethealthspan.com/research/article/heavy-metal-exposure-neurological-health-longevity\">accumulate in the blood, these substances</a> can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.1712\">delay or impair mental functioning</a>, damage nerves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92236-w\">soften bones</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82435-6\">raise blood pressure</a> – which in turn increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Heavy metals can also increase the <a href=\"https://cancerscience.net/knowledgebase/which-cancers-are-linked-to-heavy-metal-exposure\">risk of developing cancer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that all the products Consumer Reports flagged have lead levels significantly lower than the maximum daily exposure levels established by the FDA.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers can limit exposure by choosing dairy- or animal-based sources of protein products, since they generally seemed to have less heavy metal contamination than plant-based ones. However, some plant-based protein products in the study did not have high levels of heavy metals. Heavy metal levels vary <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170972\">widely in the environment</a>, so the results from the Consumer Reports study show a snapshot in time. They might not be consistently accurate across batches if, for example, a manufacturer changes the source of its raw ingredients. </p>\n\n<p>For protein products that do show an especially high heavy metal content, using them more sporadically, rather than daily, can reduce exposure. Studies suggest that <a href=\"https://www.biotech-asia.org/vol17no2/analysis-of-nutrients-heavy-metals-and-microbial-content-in-organic-and-non-organic-agriculture-fields-of-bareilly-region-western-uttar-pradesh-india/\">organic plant-based products</a> generally yield less heavy metal content than traditionally farmed ones. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Consumer Reports study measured heavy metals in a single serving of protein products, so it’s helpful to understand what constitutes a serving for specific products and to avoid sharply increasing daily consumption. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the wide variation in lead levels across different protein powders and ready-made protein products highlights the need for manufacturers to tighten product testing and good manufacturing practices.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267591/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>C.

That may sound like a lot, but the country has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/ewjm.173.5.348\">struggled for decades</a> to train <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/doctor-shortages-have-hobbled-health-care-for-decades-and-the-trend-could-be-worsening-251222\">enough physicians to meet its needs</a> – and, in particular, to provide <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-health-care-is-rife-with-high-costs-and-deep-inequities-and-thats-no-accident-a-public-health-historian-explains-how-the-system-was-shaped-to-serve-profit-and-politicians-256393\">care in rural and underserved communities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Foreign-born physicians have long filled that gap, reducing the overall national shortage and signing up to practice in often overlooked regions and specialties. Today, <a href=\"https://meridian.allenpress.com/jmr/article/111/2/7/507660/FSMB-Census-of-Licensed-Physicians-in-the-United\">1 in 5 doctors licensed to practice in the U.S.</a> were born and trained in another country.</p>\n\n<p>But the ability of physicians from other countries to obtain work in the U.S. may be threatened by the Trump administration’s aims of limiting foreign workers. In September, Trump issued a proclamation requiring employers sponsoring foreign-born workers through a type of work visa called an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\">H-1B to pay a fee of US$100,000</a> to the government. The White House has <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hospital-physician-relationships/white-house-weighs-exemptions-on-hb-1-visa-fees-for-physicians\">signaled doctors may be exempt</a> but has not clarified its position.</p>\n\n<p>As a physician and professor who studies <a href=\"https://olin.washu.edu/faculty/patrick-aguilar\">the intersection of business and medicine</a>, I believe increasing restrictions on H-1B visas for physicians may exacerbate the physician shortage. To grasp why that is, it’s important to understand how foreign-trained doctors became such an integral part of U.S. health care – and the role they play today. </p>\n\n<h2>The roots of today’s physician shortage</h2>\n\n<p>The Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade association representing U.S. medical schools, estimates there will be a <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage\">deficit of about 86,000 physicians</a> in the country by 2036. </p>\n\n<p>The roots of this shortage stretch back more than a century. In 1910, a landmark study called the Flexner Report detailed <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3178858/\">significant inconsistencies in the quality of education</a> at American medical schools. The report resulted in the <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/the-1910-report-that-unintentionally-disadvantaged-minority-doctors/\">closure of over half the country’s medical schools</a>, winnowing their numbers down from 148 to 66 over two decades. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33937\">the number of doctors in the U.S. declined</a> until new training programs emerged. Between 1960 and 1980, <a href=\"https://medicine.hofstra.edu/pdf/about/medicine_doc_macy1009.pdf\">40 new medical schools launched</a> with the help of federal funding. In 1980, a congressionally mandated assessment deemed the problem solved, but by the early 2000s, a physician shortage emerged once more. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges called for <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/us-medical-school-enrollment-surpasses-expansion-goal\">raising medical school enrollment by 30%</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor looking at x-rays\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696603/original/file-20251015-66-l6h09h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Foreign-born doctors have helped the U.S. bridge a physician shortage for decades.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/doctor-royalty-free-image/671053838\">stevecoleimages/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Growth in medical school enrollment hit that target in the late 2010s, but even so, the U.S. still lacks <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">enough medical graduates</a> to fill yearslong training programs, called residencies, that early-career physicians must complete to become fully qualified to practice.     </p>\n\n<p>Especially lacking are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4300/JGME-D-24-00591.1\">primary care physicians</a> – particularly in <a href=\"https://www.ruralhealth.us/blogs/2025/06/rural-physician-burnout-and-staffing-shortage-impact-in-2025\">rural areas</a>, where there are <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/about-us/mission-areas/health-care/rethinking-rural-health\">one-third as many physicians per capita</a> as in urban areas. </p>\n\n<h2>Opportunities for foreign-born doctors</h2>\n\n<p>Even as the U.S. built up medical school enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, the government joined other countries such as the U.K. and Canada in creating immigration policies that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1747-5341-3-24\">drew physicians from developing countries</a> to practice in underserved areas. Between 1970 and 1980, <a href=\"https://www.phg.com/2000/01/physician-statistics-summary/\">their numbers grew sharply</a>, from 57,000 to 97,000. </p>\n\n<p>Foreign-born and -trained physicians have remained a key pillar of the U.S. medical system. In recent years, the <a href=\"https://www.intealth.org/pdfs/EVSP-Physicians-Country-2024.pdf\">majority of those physicians</a> have come from India and Pakistan. Citizens of Canada and Middle Eastern countries have added significantly to that count, as well. Most arrive in the U.S. as trainees in residency programs through one of <a href=\"https://www.practicelink.com/resource-center/physician-immigration-visa/j1-vs-h1b-visa-for-medical-residency/\">two main visa programs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The majority come on J-1 visas, which allow physicians to enter the U.S. for training but require them to return to their home country for at least two years when their training is complete. Those who wish to remain in the U.S. to practice <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/america-is-increasingly-dependent-on-foreign-doctors-but-their-path-to-immigration-is-getting-harder-229980\">must transition to an H-1B visa</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A small percentage of physicians come to the U.S. on H-1Bs from the start.</p>\n\n<p>H-1B visas are employer-sponsored temporary work permits that <a href=\"https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/the-h-1b-visa-explained\">allow foreign-born, highly skilled workers</a> to obtain U.S. employment. Employers directly petition the government on behalf of visa applicants, certifying that a foreign worker will be paid a similar wage to U.S. workers and will not adversely affect the working conditions of Americans. </p>\n\n<p>Several programs sponsor H-1B visas for physicians, though the most common requires a <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/conrad-30-waiver-program\">three-year commitment to work in an underserved</a> area after completing their training. </p>\n\n<h2>Foreign physicians fill a crucial need</h2>\n\n<p>In 2025, foreign-trained medical graduates filled <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">9,700 of the nearly 40,000 training positions</a>. Of those, roughly one-third were actually U.S. citizens who attended medical schools in other countries, with the remainder being foreign citizens seeking more training in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>After residency, these doctors frequently practice in precisely the geographic areas where the <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bureau-health-workforce/state-of-the-primary-care-workforce-report-2024.pdf\">physician shortage is most severe</a>. A nationwide survey of international medical graduates found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1915548\">two-thirds practice in regions</a> that the federal government has designated as <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/workforce-shortage-areas/shortage-designation\">lacking sufficient access to health care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These doctors also occupy a disproportionate number of primary care positions. In a sample of 15,000 physicians who accepted new jobs in one year, foreign-born doctors were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09123-9\">nine times more likely to enter primary care</a> specialties. In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/05/nrmp-releases-2025-main-residency-match-results-and-data-report-providing-in-depth-insight-into-the-largest-residency-match-in-history/\">33.3% of internal medicine</a>, 20.4% of pediatric and 17.6% of family medicine training positions were filled by physicians trained in other countries.</p>\n\n<h2>Who will pay?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/aha-ama-warn-steep-visa-fee-will-exacerbate-clinician-shortages-hit-underserved-areas\">Approximately 8,000 foreign-born physicians</a> received H-1B visas in 2024. The new requirement of a $100,000 sponsorship fee would hit hardest for hospitals, health systems and clinics in areas of the country most significantly affected by the physician shortage.  </p>\n\n<p>These organizations are already under economic strain due to <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/press-releases/2025-04-30-new-aha-report-hospitals-and-health-systems-squeezed-persistent-economic-challenges\">increasing labor costs and Medicare payments</a> that have not kept pace with inflation. Dozens of these hospitals have <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/10-things-to-know-about-rural-hospitals/\">closed in recent years</a>, and many currently do not make enough money to support their operations. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 25, 2025, 57 physician organizations cosigned a letter petitioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/education/international-medical-education/waiving-100000-h-1b-fee-imgs-serves-national-interest\">waive the new application fee for physicians</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Already, however, the new rule may be having a chilling effect. Despite years of annual growth in the number of foreign-born applicants to U.S. physician training programs, 2025 has seen a <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/publication/eras-statistics\">nearly 10% drop</a>. If the new H-1B fee is applied to physicians, the number is likely to keep falling.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266544/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Patrick Aguilar Washington University, an employer of physicians. </span></em></p>",

Oxidants can damage the structure and function of the chemicals in your body critical to life – like the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/functions-of-protein#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2\">proteins</a> and <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24425-lipids\">lipids</a> within your cells, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00694\">your DNA, which stores genetic information</a>. A special class of oxidants, free radicals, are <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652#how-do-free-radicals-damage-the-body\">even more reactive and dangerous</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://campus.und.edu/directory/nathaniel.johnson.4\">assistant professor of nutrition</a>, I’ve studied the long-standing research showing how the imbalances in antioxidants and oxidants lead to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress\">oxidative stress</a>, which is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_862_16\">linked to cancer</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb45080420\">diabetes</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9090864\">cardiovascular disease</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-2009-1041\">dementia and Alzheimer’s disease</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030552\">a primary cause of aging</a> is the damage accumulated across of a lifetime of oxidative stress. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put: To help prevent oxidative stress, people need to eat foods with antioxidants and limit their exposure to oxidants, particularly free radicals. </p>\n\n<h2>The research: Food, not supplements</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no way for any of us to avoid some oxidative stress. Just metabolism – the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21893-metabolism\">processes in your body</a> that keep you alive, such as breathing, digestion and maintaining body temperature – are a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac4765\">source of oxidants and free radicals</a>. \n<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21660-inflammation\">Inflammation</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101621\">pollution</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S94374\">radiation</a> are other sources. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, everyone needs antioxidants. There are many different types: <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21532-enzymes\">enzymes</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/definitions/mineralsdefinitions.html#\">minerals</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002399.htm#:%7E\">vitamins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/what-are-phytochemicals-and-why-should-you-eat-more-them\">phytochemicals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Two types of phytochemicals deserve special mention: <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids\">carotenoids</a> and <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-flavonoids-everything-you-need-to-know\">flavonoids</a>. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids\">Carotenoids</a> are pigments, with the colors yellow, orange and red; they contain the antioxidants <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/252758\">beta-carotene</a>, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-lycopene\">lycopene</a> and <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=19&amp;contentid=Lutein#\">lutein</a>. Some <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-flavonoids-everything-you-need-to-know\">flavonoids</a>, called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/16546628.2017.1361779\">anthocyanins</a>, are pigments that give foods a blue, red or purple color. </p>\n\n<p>Although your body <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-antioxidants#\">produces some of these antioxidants</a>, you can get them from the foods you eat, and they’re better for you than supplements. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, researchers found that antioxidant supplements <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.600\">did not reduce deaths</a>, and some supplements in excessive amounts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.20471/acc.2019.58.04.20\">contribute to oxidative stress</a>, and may even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.297.8.842\">increase the risk of dying</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It should be pointed out that in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.297.8.842\">most of these studies</a>, only one or two antioxidants were given, and often in amounts far greater than the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t2/?report=objectonly\">recommended daily value</a>. One study, for example, gave participants only vitamin A, and at an amount <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/21.6.435\">more than 60 times an adult’s recommended intake</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqQLpXQqMGo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A synopsis of the study that measured the antioxidant content of more than 3,000 foods.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Foods rich in antioxidants</h2>\n\n<p>In contrast, increased antioxidant intake from whole foods is related to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-21748-x\">decreased risk of death</a>. And although antioxidant supplementation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/62.6.1427S\">didn’t reduce cancer rates in smokers</a>, the antioxidants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwh173\">in whole foods did</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But measuring antioxidants in foods is complicated. Extensive <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073380\">laboratory testing is required</a>, and too many foods exist to test them all anyway. Even individual food items that are the same exact variety of food – such as two Gala apples – can have different amounts of antioxidants. Where the food <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5142/jgr.2013.37.355\">was grown and harvested</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fochx.2022.100334\">how it was processed</a> and how it was stored during <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.685\">transportation and while in the supermarket</a> are factors. The variety of the food also matters – the many different types of apples, for instance, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/jf047832r\">can have different amounts of antioxidants</a>.   </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, in 2018, researchers quantified the antioxidant content <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-9-3\">of more than 3,100 foods</a> – the first antioxidant database. Each food’s antioxidant capacity was determined by the amount of oxidants neutralized by a given amount of food. The researchers measured this capacity in millimoles per 100 grams, or about 4 ounces.</p>\n\n<p>For fruits easily found in the grocery store, the database shows blueberries have the most antioxidants – just over 9 millimoles per 4 ounces. The same serving of pomegranates and blackberries each have about 6.5 millimoles. </p>\n\n<p>For common vegetables, cooked artichoke has 4.54 millimoles per 4 ounces; red kale, 4.09 millimoles; cooked red cabbage, 2.15; and orange bell pepper, 1.94. </p>\n\n<p>Coffee has 2.5 millimoles per 4 ounces; green tea has 1.5; whole walnuts, just over 13; whole pecans, about 9.7; and sunflower seeds, just over 5. Herbs and spices <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox6030070\">have a lot</a>: clove has 465 millimoles per 4 ounces; rosemary has 67; and thyme, about 64. But keep in mind that those enormous numbers are based on a quarter-pound. Still, just a normal sprinkle <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox6030070\">packs a powerful nutritional punch</a>.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young woman picks up a package of fresh produce at the supermarket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696839/original/file-20251016-56-otspvf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The antioxidant levels of a food can be affected by its storage time in the supermarket.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-asian-woman-with-shopping-cart-carrying-a-royalty-free-image/1465219564?phrase=foods%20in%20the%20grocery%20store&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">d3sign/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Other tips</h2>\n\n<p>Other ways to choose antioxidant-rich foods: Read the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/truth-in-labeling-act-would-heighten-the-warning-for-shoppers-looking-to-cut-sugar-salt-and-saturated-fat-intake-233856\">nutrition facts label</a> and look for antioxidant vitamins and minerals – vitamins A, C, E, D, B2, B3 and B9, and the minerals selenium, zinc and manganese. </p>\n\n<p>Just know the label has a drawback. Food producers and manufacturers are not required to list every nutrient of the food on the label. In fact, the only vitamins and minerals <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/whats-nutrition-facts-label\">required by law</a> are sodium, potassium, calcium, iron and vitamin D. </p>\n\n<p>Also, focus on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2019.11.001\">eating the rainbow</a>. Colorful foods are often higher in antioxidants, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.01.014\">blue corn</a>. Many darker foods are rich in antioxidants, too, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.109\">dark chocolate</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.790765\">black barley</a> and dark leafy vegetables, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9020097\">such as kale and Swiss chard</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Although heat can degrade oxidants, that mostly occurs during the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.685\">storage and transportation of the food</a>. In some cases, cooking may increase the food’s antioxidant capacity, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3746/pnf.2017.22.3.216\">as with leafy green vegetables</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that while blueberries, red kale and pecans are great, their antioxidant profile will be different than that of other fruits, vegetables and nuts. That’s why diversity is the key: To increase the power of antioxidants, choose a variety of fresh, flavorful, colorful and, ideally, local foods.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256974/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nathaniel Johnson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Voices of Japanese American Incarceration during World War II</a>,” barbed wire surrounded the perimeter and armed soldiers peered down from guard towers. The toilets and showers lacked partitions, and Nagano was forced to stand in long lines for hours in mess halls that served canned food. Her bed was a metal cot. She was directed to stuff straw into a bag for a makeshift mattress.

Her son, Dan Kwong, told me in an interview that Nagano ended up playing catcher for The Gremlins, one of the camp’s many women’s softball teams.</p>\n\n<p>“In one game, a batter connected with the ball and then threw the bat, clocking my mom in the nose, breaking it,” he said. “But despite her injury, she still enjoyed playing, even though she didn’t think her team was very good.” </p>\n\n<p>Eighty years later, the descendants of prisoners – such as Nagano’s son, Kwong – are playing baseball again in Manzanar. Thanks to an effort spearheaded by Kwong, a baseball field on the site has been restored as a way to both celebrate the resiliency of so many prisoners and memorialize this dark period in U.S. history.</p>\n\n<h2>A massive removal effort</h2>\n\n<p>After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Commission_on_Wartime_Relocation_and_Internment_of_Civilians/\">the U.S. government wrongly assumed</a> that Japanese-descended West Coast residents would be more loyal to Japan and presented an espionage risk.</p>\n\n<p>So on Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Executive_Order_9066/\">executive order</a> that gave the U.S. Army the authority to forcibly remove all first-generation immigrants from Japan and their American-born descendants from their West Coast homes.</p>\n\n<p>In March 1942, U.S. soldiers began transporting the detainees to temporary detention sites under Army jurisdiction. The Manzanar site opened on March 21, 1942, and it eventually became one of 10 long-term detention centers, colloquially known as “the camps.” </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.duncanryukenwilliams.com/about\">Duncan Ryȗken Williams</a>, the director of <a href=\"https://ireizo.org/about/\">The Irei Project</a>, which has compiled the most comprehensive list of those detained, nearly 127,000 people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated between 1942 and 1947, when the last camp closed. Two-thirds of them were American citizens. Most were imprisoned for the duration of the war, and all were held without hearings or charges leveled against them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An Asian American boy swings a baseball bat at an approach ball as other boys watch in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=446&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696600/original/file-20251015-66-oqs2bz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=560&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sixth-grade boys play softball during recess at the Manzanar Relocation Center on Feb. 10, 1943.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://cdm16855.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16855coll4/id/11431\">Francis Leroy Stewart, courtesy of California State University Dominguez Hills Gerth Archives &amp; Special Collections</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A love of the game</h2>\n\n<p>Adjusting to their new grim reality, the detainees embraced the Japanese spirit of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190319-the-art-of-perseverance-how-gaman-defined-japan\">gaman</a>,” which means to endure hardship with dignity and resilience.

Though Zenimura was forced to leave his Fresno home and go to a camp in <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Gila_River/\">Gila River, Arizona</a>, he soon had a baseball diamond and a 32-team league up and running.</p>\n\n<h2>Patriotism on the diamond</h2>\n\n<p>At Manzanar, baseball was easily <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/manzanar-baseball.htm\">the most popular sport</a>. According to Dave Goto, the Manzanar National Historic Site arborist, the camp had 10 baseball and softball diamonds on the grounds and more than 120 teams divided into 12 leagues. The camp newspaper, the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Manzanar_Free_Press_(newspaper)/\">Manzanar Free Press</a>, provided detailed game recaps, and thousands turned out to watch the games at Manzanar’s “A” Field. </p>\n\n<p>“Watching baseball played at a semi-pro level was entertainment and also gave them a sense of normalcy and community,” Nakagawa said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Sepia toned photograph of Japanese Americans wearing baseball uniforms and posing for a team picture.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=408&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696568/original/file-20251015-56-utev8r.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The ManzaKnights were one of the 100-plus teams formed at the Manzanar camp.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of the Maruki Family/Manzanar Historic Site</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But for those who felt their loyalty to the U.S. was unfairly questioned, baseball was also a powerful way to express their identity as Americans, especially for the U.S.-born children of Japanese immigrants. Takeo Suo, who was incarcerated at Manazarer, recalled, “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/manzanar-baseball.htm\">Putting on a baseball uniform was like wearing the American flag</a>.” Or, as Nakagawa put it, \n“What could be more American than playing the all-American pastime?” </p>\n\n<p>After the war was over and the camps closed, those who’d been imprisoned had to focus on rebuilding their lives. Many were unable to return to their prewar hometowns. For those who ended up back on the West Coast, baseball continued to play an important role.</p>\n\n<p>As Japanese American journalist and sports historian Chris Komai explained in a <a href=\"https://www.janm.org/events/2024-12-07/manzanar-baseball-project\">program at the Japanese American National Museum</a>, “Baseball was a way for them to reestablish their communities while they <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Resettlement/\">dealt with antagonism and discrimination</a>. Through the games they stayed connected with their friends and relatives who were now scattered.” </p>\n\n<p>Postwar community baseball gave rise to the Southern California Nisei Athletic Union Baseball Leagues and other leagues that still operate. Kwong began playing for the Nisei Athletic Union in 1971 and does so to this day.</p>\n\n<h2>Rebuilding a dusty field of dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Nagano instilled in her son a commitment not only to baseball but also to social justice. A performance artist, Kwong stages a one-man play, “<a href=\"https://www.greatleap.org/performances\">Return of the Samurai Centerfielder</a>,” to shed light on this episode in history through the lens of playing baseball at Manzanar.

People in these roles serve kids and families across the country. They help them answer questions about how school districts are providing for their children, in the way they are legally required to, if their child has special needs. </p>\n\n<p>Special education is <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/contact-us/faqs/Special%20Education%20and%20Rehabilitative%20Services#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20regulations%2C%20a,provide%20assistance%2C%20organized%20by%20state.\">a very broad category</a>. Under the Department of Education, it encompasses everything from dyslexia to a child who is blind. There is no educational need so severe that a child is not entitled to <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/civil-rights-laws/disability-discrimination/disability-discrimination-key-issues/disability-discrimination-providing-free-appropriate-public-education-fape\">free and adequate education</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When navigating challenges related to your child’s special needs education, you really need an advocate – in the legal sense of the term rather than the political one. You need someone whose job it is to take your call and walk you through options, or just document your call and start an inquiry into your case. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the Office of Special Education Programs do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Office of Special Education Programs is part of the Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which has about 179 employees. The government spent more than <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/subagency/office-of-special-education-and-rehabilitative-services/\">US$20 billion on its work</a> from April 2024 through March 2025, making the broader Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services the third-largest branch of the Education Department, in terms of spending. </p>\n\n<p>There are very strong federal legal obligations – and often state ones, too – for schools to serve kids with whatever need they have. This office’s main job is to be a <a href=\"https://www.parentcenterhub.org/resourcelibrary/index/o/o1/\">resource to parents</a> for their child’s education, particularly if parents feel they are not having these legal obligations met.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say a child with autism is in school. Their parent does not believe the school district is providing the accommodations that their child is legally entitled to. The school district disagrees and thinks the child is doing well in school. When things get fuzzy about what a child’s needs actually are, or parents feel they are being ignored, OSEP can help parents learn what their options are, and then can even become involved and serve as an arbitrator to figure out the best course of action.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, public school districts and state departments of education have very clear, accessible ways for parents to receive information about their rights and obtain instructions for putting together an <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/iepguide.pdf\">individualized education plan</a> for their child. If those rights are not met, states may open an investigation into the matter to ensure compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this process, parents may seek support and guidance from OSEP to make sure state investigations into special education cases are being done and being done well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What could these investigations result in?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Department of Education can help hold states and districts accountable and push districts and schools to be more responsive. In the best-case scenario, additional or tailored programming and support – whether it is a teacher’s aide or something else – can come from an OSEP investigation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An older white woman wears a cream suit and sits at a table, with two men on either side of her.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696808/original/file-20251016-56-vgbr5a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, center, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Aug. 26, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/secretary-of-education-linda-mcmahon-alongside-epa-news-photo/2231526601?adppopup=true\">Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>What does your research show about the impact of cutting services like these?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Well, we don’t really know what happens when you gut OSEP because no one has tried to gut OSEP before. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s safe to say that parents will get really frustrated. I have been contacted by parents who have shared heartbreaking examples of the special education system not working over the past couple of years. </p>\n\n<p>Feeling like the education system is really not serving you can push parents to leave the public school system and consider homeschooling or private options. In the long run, this may actually make parents even worse off because those sectors have <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-94\">have no obligation at all to serve students with special needs</a>. So what’s happening at the U.S. Department of Education right now is not only creating more dissatisfaction and distrust in the system as it stands, but it’s also going to leave parents and kids with fewer options to get the support they need.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267684/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Josh Cowen ran for Congress as a Democrat prior to ending his campaign and returning to research and teaching during the fall of 2025.</span></em></p>",

The AI-generated civics lesson plans we analyzed also left out opportunities for students to explore the stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized people.</p>\n\n<p>The allure of generative AI as a teaching aid has caught the attention of educators. A Gallup survey from September 2025 found that <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/659819/k-12-teacher-research.aspx\">60% of K-12 teachers are already using AI in their work</a>, with the most common reported use being teaching preparation and lesson planning.  </p>\n\n<p>Without the assistance of AI, teachers might spend hours every week crafting lessons for their students. With AI, <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/survey-teachers-work-more-hours-week-other-working-adults\">time-stretched</a> teachers can generate detailed lesson plans featuring learning objectives, materials, activities, assessments, extension activities and homework tasks in a matter of seconds. </p>\n\n<p>However, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot were not originally built with educators in mind. Instead, these tools were trained on huge amounts of text and media drawn largely from across the internet and then launched as general-purpose chatbots. </p>\n\n<p>As we started using these tools in our practice as educators, we noticed they often produced instructional materials and lessons that echoed the “recite and recall” model of traditional schooling. This model can be effective for memorizing basic facts, but it often fails to engage students in the active learning required to become informed citizens. We wondered whether teachers should be using these general-purpose chatbots to prepare for class.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://citejournal.org/proofing/civic-education-in-the-age-of-ai-should-we-trust-ai-generated-lesson-plans/\">For our research</a>, we began collecting and analyzing AI-generated lesson plans to get a sense of what kinds of instructional plans and materials these tools provide to teachers. We decided to focus on AI-generated lesson plans for civics education because it is essential for students to learn productive ways to participate in the U.S. political system and engage with their communities.</p>\n\n<p>To collect data for this study, in August 2024 we prompted three GenAI chatbots – the GPT-4o model of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model and Microsoft’s latest Copilot model – to generate two sets of lesson plans for eighth grade civics classes based on Massachusetts state standards. One was a standard lesson plan and the other a highly interactive lesson plan. </p>\n\n<p>We garnered a dataset of 311 AI-generated lesson plans, featuring a total of 2,230 activities for civic education. We analyzed the dataset using two frameworks designed to assess educational material: Bloom’s taxonomy and Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://teaching.cornell.edu/resource/blooms-taxonomy\">Bloom’s taxonomy</a> is a widely used educational framework that distinguishes between “lower-order” thinking skills, including remembering, understanding and applying, and “higher-order” thinking skills – analyzing, evaluating and creating. Using this framework to analyze the data, we found 90% of the activities promoted only a basic level of thinking for students. Students were encouraged to learn civics through memorizing, reciting, summarizing and applying information, rather than through analyzing and evaluating information, investigating civic issues or engaging in civic action projects. </p>\n\n<p>When examining the lesson plans using <a href=\"https://www.teachingforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Banks_James.pdf\">Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content model</a>, which was developed in the 1990s, we found that the AI-generated civics lessons featured a rather narrow view of history – often leaving out the experiences of women, Black Americans, Latinos and Latinas, Asian and Pacific Islanders, disabled individuals and other groups that have long been overlooked. Only 6% of the lessons included multicultural content. These lessons also tended to focus on heroes and holidays rather than deeper explorations of understanding civics through multiple perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, we found the AI-generated lesson plans to be decidedly boring, traditional and uninspiring. If civics teachers used these AI-generated lesson plans as is, students would miss out on active, engaged learning opportunities to build their understanding of democracy and what it means to be a citizen. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Teachers can try to customize lesson plans to their situation through prompts, but ultimately generative AI tools do not consider any actual students or real classroom settings the way a teacher can.</p>\n\n<p>Although designed to seem <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/17/business/ai-text-detection.html\">as if they understand users</a> and be in dialogue with them, from a technical perspective chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/large-language-models-how-the-ai-behind-the-likes-of-chatgpt-actually-works-244701\">machines that predict the next word in a sequence based on massive amounts of ingested text</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When teachers choose to use these tools while preparing to teach, they risk relying on technology not designed to enhance, aid or improve teaching and learning. Instead, we see these tools producing step-by-step, one-size-fits-all solutions, when what’s needed in education is the opposite – flexibility, personalization and student-centered learning. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"jVfrq\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jVfrq/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>While our study revealed that AI-generated lesson plans are lacking in many areas, this does not mean that teachers should not use these tools to prepare for class. A teacher could use generative AI technologies to advance their thinking. In the AI-generated lesson plans we analyzed, there were occasional interesting activities and stimulating ideas, especially within the homework suggestions. We would recommend that teachers use these tools to augment their lesson-planning process rather than automate it.</p>\n\n<p>By understanding AI tools cannot think or understand context, teachers can change the way they interact with these tools. Rather than writing simple, short requests – “Design a lesson plan for the Constitutional Convention” – they could write detailed prompts that include contextual information, along with proven frameworks, models and teaching methods. A better prompt would be: “Design a lesson plan for the Constitutional Convention for 8th grade students in Massachusetts that features at least three activities at the evaluate or create level of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Make sure to incorporate hidden histories and untold stories as well as civic engagement activities at the social action level of Banks’ four levels of integration of multicultural content model.” </p>\n\n<p>Our study emphasizes the need for teachers to be critical users, rather than quick adopters, of AI-generated lessons. AI is not an all-in-one solution designed to address the needs of teachers and students. Ultimately, more research and teacher professional development opportunities are needed to explore whether or how AI might improve teaching and learning.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265355/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That included reporting on a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/politics/afghanistan-drone-strike-video.html\">drone strike</a> that killed 10 civilians, not ISIS militants, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">the government initially claimed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But free press advocates warn that recent changes in a Pentagon policy threaten journalists’ ability to cover the Department of Defense. That’s because it could curb their rights to report information not authorized by the government for release.</p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/920380090/Pentagon-Media-Memo-Full\">initial policy change announced on Sept. 20</a>, 2025 – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">and later revised</a> – forbade journalists from publishing anything that hadn’t been approved by government officials. It gave journalists 10 days to sign and agree to the restrictions. A refusal to sign could have resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">cancellation of their press credentials</a> to enter the Pentagon.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.bellisario.psu.edu/people/individual/amy-kristin-sanders\">a First Amendment expert</a>, I believe the Pentagon policy change represents an unprecedented development in the Trump administration’s offensive against the press and a historic departure from previous administrations’ policies. </p>\n\n<p>Attacks on journalism, said once-imprisoned journalist Peter Greste, “are a national security issue, and we have to protect press freedom.” Greste spoke in early October 2025 at the Global Free Speech Summit in Nashville, Tennessee, adding that “anything that undermines press freedom undermines national security.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/01/joy-release-peter-greste-egypt\">Greste was jailed for more than a year</a> in Egypt while working for Al Jazeera in 2013. In Nashville, he drew a direct connection between the public’s access to information under a free press and the stability and freedom that democracies enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Even President Donald Trump seemed critical of the policy initially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/trump-pentagon-journalists\">telling a reporter</a> in September 2025 he didn’t think the Pentagon should be in charge of deciding what reporters can cover. </p>\n\n<h2>An attempt to control critical coverage</h2>\n\n<p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/920380090/Pentagon-Media-Memo-Full\">initial Pentagon policy change</a>, journalists covering the Defense Department were required to sign a contract saying that department information must be “approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.”</p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQsMOxILtlw\">told Fox News</a> on Oct. 5, “The Pentagon press corps can squeal all they want, we’re taking these things seriously. They can report, they just need to make sure they’re following rules.”</p>\n\n<p>Media outlets decided they could not accept the policy change. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/media/pentagon-hegseth-press-reporter-rules\">They also mulled legal action</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">Pentagon revised its initial policy change</a> on Oct. 6 and set an Oct. 14 deadline for journalists to comply. The revised policy says prior approval would not be required to report on the Defense Department, but it suggests that <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/news/pentagon-doubles-down-pete-hegseth-muzzling-reporters-press-corps-policy.php\">soliciting information from Pentagon sources</a> “would not be considered protected activity under the 1st Amendment.” But journalists who don’t sign and follow <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/business/media/trump-pentagon-reporters-press.html\">the revised policy</a> could be deemed “security risks” and lose their credentials to access the Pentagon.</p>\n\n<p>As the Oct. 14 deadline approached, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/five-major-broadcast-networks-say-will-not-sign-new-pentagon-press-pol-rcna237526\">dozens of media outlets</a> said they would not sign the revised policy. Fox, Newsmax and the Daily Caller – all conservative news organizations – have also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/media/pentagon-press-hegseth-restrictions-journalists-fox\">rejected the policy</a>. The following day, journalists from dozens of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/15/business/media/pentatgon-press-rules.html\">news outlets turned in their press passes</a> rather than agree to the new policy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26183464-ppa-statementdocx-1/\">The Pentagon Press Association</a>, which represents journalists covering the Defense Department, says the revised policy is “asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding’ of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.”</p>\n\n<p>Conservative commentators have also criticized the policy. Law professor <a href=\"https://www.law.gwu.edu/jonathan-turley\">Jonathan Turley</a> <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/pentagons-new-press-rules-may-bridge-too-far-turley-warns\">told Fox News</a>: “What they’re basically saying is if you publish anything that’s not in the press release, is not the official statement of the Pentagon, you could be held responsible under this policy. That is going to create a stranglehold on the free press, and the cost is too great.”</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time Hegseth has sought to limit media coverage of the Pentagon. In May 2025 <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1926020350191567308\">he restricted journalists’ access</a> to large portions of the Pentagon where they’d previously been allowed to go unescorted. </p>\n\n<h2>Freedom from government control</h2>\n\n<p>It is not unusual for the government to view the <a href=\"https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2386&amp;context=hastings_law_journal\">press as an adversary</a>. But such direct attempts to control media outlets have been rare in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government has rarely been successful in its efforts to censor the media. In the 1930s, the Supreme Court set a high bar for the government to overcome if it wanted to stop the presses.</p>\n\n<p>As Chief Justice Charles Hughes wrote in 1930 in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/283/697/\">Near v. Minnesota</a>: “The fact that, for approximately one hundred and fifty years, there has been almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints upon publications relating to the malfeasance of public officers is significant of the deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional right.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit and tie speaks in front of a lecturn.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696595/original/file-20251015-66-fbuzp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a news conference at the Pentagon on June 22, 2025, in Arlington, Va.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-speaks-during-a-news-news-photo/2220718203?adppopup=true\">Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the years since, the high court has reiterated its belief that an adversarial press is essential to democracy. At the height of the Vietnam War, the court ruled the government could not prevent The New York Times from <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/new-york-times-co-v-united-states-the-pentagon-papers-case\">publishing leaked documents detailing U.S involvement</a> in the conflict, despite the sensitive nature of the documents. </p>\n\n<p>President Richard Nixon’s own nominee, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/justices/warren_e_burger\">Chief Justice Warren Burger</a>, recognized the danger of allowing the <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">government to restrict freedom of the press</a>. “The thread running through all these cases is that prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights. … The damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the communication of news and commentary on current events,” Burger wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Burger acknowledged the role the press plays as a watchdog against the government’s abuse of power in 1976 in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart</a>. “The press … guards against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting the (legal system) to extensive public scrutiny and criticism.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether the Supreme Court’s commitment to these long-standing precedents remains steadfast is anyone’s guess. </p>\n\n<p>Law scholars <a href=\"https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u6007959\">RonNell Andersen Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.law.uga.edu/profile/sonja-r-west\">Sonja West</a> have <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6865&amp;context=nclr\">documented</a> a marked decline in references by the high court to press freedom over the past two decades. They have also noted a dramatic change in the justices’ tone when discussing the press: </p>\n\n<p>“(A)ny assumption that the Court is poised to be the branch to defend the press against disparagement is misplaced … When members of the press turn to the Court in their legal battles, they will no longer find an institution that consistently values their role in our democracy,” <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6865&amp;context=nclr\">Andersen Jones and West write</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/539/\">Burger was aware</a> that muzzling the press posed serious consequences for a democratic society: “(I)t is nonetheless clear that the barriers to prior restraint remain high unless we are to abandon what the Court has said for nearly a quarter of our national existence and implied throughout all of it. The history of even wartime suspension of categorical guarantees, such as habeas corpus or the right to trial by civilian courts cautions against suspending explicit guarantees,” Burger wrote in his opinion in Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart in 1976.</p>\n\n<p>The new Pentagon policy, however, does just that by threatening reporters who write critical stories with the loss of their press credentials.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266129/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Amy Kristin Sanders has served as an expert witness for Fox News.

But first it is worth exploring what we mean when we use the term coup.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a coup?</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqab058\">coup d’état</a> is a seizure of executive power involving one or more concrete, observable and illegal actions by security personnel or civilian officials. </p>\n\n<p>Here, Madagascar’s military takeover appears to qualify. Despite claims by the country’s new military leader, Col. Michael Randrianirina, that he had an order from the High Constitutional Court legitimizing his seizure of power, this seemed to be <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/madagascar-protests-coup-leader-d589bfacc33bfd7e7e53bfadef7c6d8b\">contradicted by statements a day earlier</a> that Randrianirina’s military council had suspended the high court’s powers.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that every political event that smells like a coup is, in fact, a coup. </p>\n\n<p>Many coup plots never come to fruition. A bona fide plot may be preempted and the plotters arrested, or plotters may abandon their plan before taking any concrete action. Moreover, sometimes a leader <a href=\"https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2020/06/16/when-are-coups-fake-news/\">falsely alleges a coup plot</a> to purge members of the government suspected of disloyalty. </p>\n\n<p>A plot without an attempt to oust the leader is not, in our book, a coup.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, attempts to target a leader without a plan to seize power are not coups. This includes <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140211024287\">leader assassination attempts</a> by political opponents or lone wolves or <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140211024287\">mutinies by disgruntled soldiers</a> who might even march on the presidential palace to demand higher pay, promotions or other policy concessions.</p>\n\n<p>Nor do most civilian-led mass uprisings entail coups, even if they are successful in toppling the government. Take Nepal, where in September a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo\">Gen Z-led protest</a> turned violent and ousted the government. But there was no coup insofar as the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nepal-gen-z-protests-army-kathmandu-2e4d9e835216b11fa238d7bcf8915cbf\">military remained quartered</a> rather than actively joining the protests or issuing a threat to compel the prime minister to resign. </p>\n\n<p>However, some revolutions and coups do co-occur, resulting in a “<a href=\"https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/restoring-democracy-lessons-from-bolivia-since-the-2019-coupvolution/\">coupvolution</a>” or “<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095327X19881747\">endgame coup</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Determining whether a coup accompanies anti-government protests depends on how elites and the military behave, not on how violent protesters may be.</p>\n\n<p>In Madagascar, mostly peaceful civilian protests turned into a coup attempt once troops actively joined the demonstrations. That attempt succeeded when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ne96gx1do\">Randrianirina</a>, commander of the elite CAPSAT force, claimed the interim presidency and insisted a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/madagascar-protests-rajoelina-ab1e1eb1aca45fe7e80e81314ebdb0c6\">military council would rule</a> for the time being.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vFnfA\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vFnfA/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Why do coups succeed?</h2>\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.johnjchin.com/colpus\">601 coup attempts since 1946</a>, according to our database, with 299 being successful – or about 50%. In Africa during that period, 111 out of 225 coup attempts were successful.</p>\n\n<p>Coups come in a variety of forms, with <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/4/1040/6312785?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">different causes and outcomes</a>, and not all are equally likely to succeed. The events in Madagascar, however, tick many of the boxes associated with determining coup success.</p>\n\n<p>Coups <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/10989/seizing-power\">depend on coordinating</a> a lot of people, while simultaneously preventing the leader from finding out about the plot. Mass protests of the kind that rocked Madagascar in recent weeks <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1017/s0022381613001485\">provide cover</a> – as well as <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002716654742\">motive and opportunity</a> – for coup plotters.</p>\n\n<p>Counterintuitively, military force is rarely decisive. In a typical coup attempt, much of the military remains neutral, biding its time to see whether the leader or coupists will prevail. Consequently, the perceived momentum of events influences how the military rank and file react: If they think the coupmakers will succeed, they typically join; if they think the coup will fail, they generally oppose it. </p>\n\n<p>A coup’s momentum depends on a variety of factors, including the identity, location and <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674737266\">strategy of coup leaders</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002716685611\">domestic and international reactions</a> to the coup. </p>\n\n<p>Coups that are launched by government insiders and senior military officers in the capital and are nonviolent and result in pro-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to succeed. By contrast, coups that are launched by government outsiders and junior officers outside the capital and are bloody and generate fierce anti-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Coup violence is inversely correlated with success. When no force is threatened – usually because the security forces remain united under a senior command – coups succeed 85% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, less than 40% of coups that escalate into civil-war levels of violence – that is, resulting in over 1,000 fatalities – succeed.</p>\n\n<p>In Madagascar, we saw the involvement of government elites and senior officers in the capital, mass pro-coup mobilization, low levels of coup violence and a history of prior successful coups – all of which make coup success likely. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A crowd of protesters.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696722/original/file-20251016-56-1xpd0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=481&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Coup supporters cheer police officers in Gabon in August 2023.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GabonCoup/a1ead7837aac41c4bc0f579eebe2bc85/photo\">AP Photo/Betiness Mackosso</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Madagascar is not alone</h2>\n\n<p>Since 2020, military actors have also <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2023.1077945/full\">taken power</a> in coups in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>So why are so many African countries prone to falling into a coup trap? </p>\n\n<p>Scholars have asked this question for decades. Development economist Paul Collier <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:49097086-8505-4eb2-8174-314ce1aa3ebb\">suggests</a> that Africa is the most coup-prone region because it is the poorest region of the world, and it is <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/poverty-the-coup-trap-and-the-seizure-of-executive-power/2D6EC35637250DDD2C5B9F9489A823D8\">poverty</a> and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002713520531\">low growth</a> – and associated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002715603098\">political violence</a> – that drive coups.</p>\n\n<p>Others have pointed to high levels of ethnic diversity, and a history of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/when-soldiers-rebel/58A5BDBF32E67D2C415FAA3826689F14\">ethnic exclusion</a> and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ethnicsoldiersst0000enlo\">ethnic militaries</a>, as long-standing drivers of coups on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>But since 2020, a number of other factors also appear to be driving up structural coup risk on the continent. Many African countries have seen <a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad891-across-africa-public-trust-in-key-institutions-and-leaders-is-weakening/\">declining trust in public institutions and leaders</a> and a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/01/1145852\">rise of terrorist violence</a>, which have generated <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/9/1/season-of-putsch-why-have-coups-become-popular-in-africa\">mass popularity</a> for recent coups on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-coup norms have also <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-fading-of-the-anti-coup-norm/\">weakened in recent years</a>. International pressure to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/coups-and-democracy/505910A86167FE82C8D7019FF6A829AB\">restore civilian rule</a> was quite strong in the 1990s and 2000s, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002716685611\">contributing</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-decline-of-the-african-military-coup/\">decline of African military coups</a>. But new post-coup African governments appear more resilient to sanctions, are <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/sahel/burkina-faso-mali-niger/defining-new-approach-sahels-military-led-states\">cooperating more</a> with each other and are able to draw on the support of authoritarian “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2015.1124089\">patrons</a>,” notably Russia and China.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, African post-coup governments are staying in power longer, which in turn emboldens coup plotters elsewhere who see a more permissive environment. </p>\n\n<p>So even if <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-myth-of-the-coup-contagion/\">there are limits</a> to Africa’s “coup contagion,” Madagascar likely won’t be the last domino to fall, given structural conditions on the continent.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267581/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John Joseph Chin does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In a 200-unit building, parking could add millions of dollars to the developer’s costs. </p>\n\n<p>Parking requirements are often determined by a formula. Based in part on an outdated view that modern cities should be car-oriented, cities around the country, including Denver, <a href=\"https://denver.prelive.opencities.com/files/assets/public/v/1/community-planning-and-development/documents/zoning/denver-zoning-code/archived-versions/2023-03-13_complete_dzc.pdf\">passed zoning codes in the 1950s and 1960s</a> that created legal requirements for the number of parking spaces that new housing projects must include.</p>\n\n<p>Land is expensive in high-demand cities like Denver. Dedicating part of a building’s footprint to parking imposes both a direct cost – because developers must pay to build the parking – and an indirect cost, because it leaves less space for housing. These development costs are passed along to renters and owners, decreasing affordability. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Cars parked near a patch of grass and a tree.

It then allows for a comparison of possible outcomes based on changing policy assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>Our predictions factor in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Building size and allowable unit counts for parcels.</li>\n<li>The type of development and corresponding number of units that are likely to be financially feasible.</li>\n<li>The probability that parcels might actually be developed in the future based on a statistical analysis of historical Denver development data. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Following guidelines developed by the <a href=\"https://www.lincolninst.edu/app/uploads/legacy-files/pubfiles/how-use-exploratory-scenario-planning-full.pdf\">Lincoln Institute of Land Policy</a>, we modeled 75 scenarios. They included five potential parking policies tested across five economic environments and three sets of assumptions for developer-driven parking inclusion. </p>\n\n<h2>Changes would bring hundreds of housing units</h2>\n\n<p>Our prediction that eliminating parking mandates in Denver could result in approximately 460 additional multifamily units per year is based on three assumptions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Somewhat unfavorable economic conditions, including high interest rates and relatively low margins for developers. </li>\n<li>Elimination of all regulatory parking mandates.</li>\n<li>Voluntary construction of 0.5 spaces per unit near light rail and 1.0 spaces per unit away from light rail.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We find that eliminating parking minimums creates <a href=\"https://www.law.du.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/Examining%20Relationships%20between%20Eliminating%20Parking%20Minimums%20and%20New%20Housing%20Construction%20Using%20a%20Terner%20Housing%20Simulator%20Tool%20-%20August%202025%20r2.pdf\">more options for developers and renters</a>. Developers will still build parking where needed or demanded by city residents.</p>\n\n<p>Eliminating mandatory parking requirements offers several additional benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The city will save labor costs associated with enforcing parking requirements, reducing housing costs.  </p>\n\n<p>The policy change <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X\">frees up land</a> for more economically productive uses and for desired civic infrastructure such as sidewalks or green space. Developers freed from building parking are also more likely to invest in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/how-to-reform-your-city-s-bad-parking-requirements\">beautifying their building for residents and pedestrians</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Removing parking minimums can <a href=\"https://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/knowledge-hub/news/parking-minimums-are-a-barrier-to-housing-development/\">increase the flexibility</a> to use small undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels for “<a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/middle-income-housing-programs-emerge-affordability-challenges-climb-income-ladder\">missing middle</a>” forms of housing, such as duplexes or triplexes. These forms of housing provide “gentle density,” meaning they do not significantly alter neighborhoods but still make them more affordable for lower- and middle-income people and increase the city’s overall housing supply. It can also allow for the adaptive reuse of historic buildings that may have been built before the city required on-site parking.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, eliminating a requirement for surplus parking spaces <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01944369508975617\">allows more compact, efficient forms of development</a>, which results in more walkable cities and more connected neighborhoods.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263889/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Susan D Daggett has received a teaching stipend from the University of Denver&#39;s Executive Certificate in Affordable Housing Program, which is partially funded by a donation from the Colorado Housing Finance Authority and the Simpson Family.

Now, it’s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-arrest-miscarriage-fetal-personhood-rcna199400\">headline news in the United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMxj894AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a scholar who studies the relationship between reproductive rights and political regimes</a>, I see the U.S. mirroring a pattern that has happened in authoritarian regimes around the world. When a government erects barriers to comprehensive reproductive care, it doesn’t just <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797896\">cause more death and suffering</a> for women and their families. Such policies are often <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/expanding-abortion-access-strengthens-democracy-while-abortion-bans-signal-broader-repression-worldwide-study-240278\">a first step in the gradual decline of democracies</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, the U.S. is different in a meaningful way. Here, abortion has historically been framed as a personal right to privacy. In many other countries I’ve studied, abortion is viewed more as a collective right that is inextricably tied to broader social and economic issues.</p>\n\n<p>The American individualist perspective on abortion can make it harder for people in the U.S. to understand why banning abortion can serve as a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/ticking-time-bomb-restrictions-on-abortion-rights-and-physical-integrity-rights-abuses/8E033094CB21BB7428E2C4D7AECA6C72\">back door for the erosion of civil liberties – and of democracy itself</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Autocrats target abortion first</h2>\n\n<p>Restricting reproductive rights is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://news.uoregon.edu/content/history-fascism-reproductive-rights-offers-lessons-today\">Benito Mussolini’s Italy</a> in 1926 and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-01-04/stalins-abortion-ban-soviet-union\">Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union</a> in 1936 to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/abortion-rights-in-spain-back-to-past/\">Francisco Franco’s Spain</a> in 1941 and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/09/15/romania-exposes-how-abortion-bans-kill-women-rip-society-apart/\">Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania</a> in 1966, the first move most 20th-century dictators made after seizing power was to criminalize abortion and contraception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, for some of those autocratic leaders, limiting access to abortion and contraception was a strategy to gain the approval of the nation’s religious leaders. The Catholic Church held great power in Italy and Spain, as did <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09668130500051924\">the Orthodox Church</a> in Romania. At the time, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00002.x\">these faiths opposed artificial birth control</a> and still believe life begins at conception.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on reproductive rights <a href=\"https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1936-2/abolition-of-legal-abortion/\">also aimed</a> to <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/01/13/inenglish/1421140333_379388.html\">increase</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0738399195008519\">birth rates</a> following two world wars that had stamped out some of the population, particularly in the Soviet Union and Italy. Many political leaders saw <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789509\">procreation as a national duty</a>. They designated women – white, heterosexual women, that is – specific roles, primarily as mothers, to produce babies as well as future soldiers and workers for their regimes.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, countries in Europe and the Americas have been following this recognizable pattern. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/31/nicaragua-abortion-ban-threatens-health-and-lives\">Nicaragua</a> and <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/un-cedaw-report-poland-abortion/\">Poland</a> have both banned abortion. <a href=\"https://populationmatters.org/news/2025/01/viktor-orbans-hungary-the-erosion-of-reproductive-rights/\">Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/05/legal-yet-virtually-banned-turkish-women-denied-right-to-free-safe-abortions\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/28/russia-limits-womens-access-to-abortion-citing-demographic-changes\">Russia</a> have all clamped down on access to it.</p>\n\n<p>Restricting reproductive freedoms has helped Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stoke lasting political divisions within society that help them consolidate their own power.</p>\n\n<p>These leaders <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2024.102947\">invoke a threat of moral and demographic decline</a>, claiming that child-free women, queer people and immigrants pose a danger to national survival. In doing so, they portray themselves as defenders of their respective nations. It’s a way to regain and retain popular support even as their policies <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/once-prosperous-hungary-is-now-the-poorest-nation-in-eu-meanwhile-this-tiny-nation-tops-the-wealth-rankings/articleshow/121978907.cms?from=mdr\">deepen poverty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/resources/reports/democracy-human-rights-and-rule-of-law-in-russia-making-the-case/\">erode civil liberties</a> and <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2014/corruption-media-and-power-turkey\">increase corruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These politicians have also taken power away from a significant portion of the population by reinstating earlier, fascist-era restrictions on bodily autonomy. As <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/Library/Publications/2020/Discussion-paper-Democratic-backsliding-and-the-backlash-against-womens-rights-en.pdf\">feminist scholars</a> have pointed out, strong reproductive rights are central to functioning democracies.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on reproductive freedoms often necessitate other kinds of restrictions to enforce and maintain them. These might include <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/texass-war-abortion-now-war-free-speech\">free speech limits</a> that prohibit providers from discussing people’s reproductive options. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/13-protesters-arrested-supreme-court-ahead-abortion-pill/story?id=108506592\">Criminalizing political dissent</a> enables the arrest of people who protest restrictions on reproductive freedoms. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/idaho-most-extreme-anti-abortion-state-law-restricts-travel-rcna78225/\">Travel bans</a> threaten prison time for individuals who help young people get abortion care out of state.</p>\n\n<p>When these civil liberties weaken, it becomes harder to defend other rights. Without the right to speak, dissent or move freely, people cannot engage in conversations, organize or voice collective grievances.</p>\n\n<h2>Putting the US in a global context</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/roe-v-wade/\">the U.S.</a> joined the likes of Poland and Hungary when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending 50 years of federal abortion protections.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump was not in power when this happened. Yet the Supreme Court’s conservative majority was shaped during <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/02/06/trump-targets-abortion-state-of-the-union/\">his first term</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-veterans-affairs-abortion-ban\">second Trump administration</a> and many states have enacted <a href=\"https://time.com/7291156/trump-emergency-abortion-guidance/\">their own regulations</a> or bans on abortion. This has created a divided country where in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html\">some states</a> abortion is as restricted as it is under some of the world’s most autocratic regimes.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, there’s a key difference.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., abortion is viewed by the law and the public as a matter of individual rights. The debate often boils down to whether a person should be allowed to terminate their pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>In many other contexts, reproductive rights are understood as a collective good that benefits all society – or, conversely, harms all society when revoked.</p>\n\n<p>This perspective can be a powerful driver of change. It’s how, for example, women’s and feminist groups in places such as <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/historic-vote-argentina-legalize-abortion/\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/colombia-court-decriminalize-abortion/\">Colombia</a> and <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/mexico-supreme-court-decriminalizes-abortion-federal/\">Mexico</a> have successfully pressured their governments to decriminalize abortion in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2018, the movement known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/opinion/abortion-latin-america.html\">Latin America’s Green Wave, or “Marea Verde</a>” for their green protest bandannas, has deliberately and strategically <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/27/1107717283/abortion-rights-green-symbol\">reframed abortion as a human right</a> and used that assertion to expand reproductive rights.</p>\n\n<p>The Latin American <a href=\"https://im-defensoras.org/en/2024/04/resumen-ejecutivo/#los-derechos-que-defendemos\">feminist activists have also documented</a> how restricting abortion intensifies authoritarianism and worsens both individual and collective rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a region where many citizens remember life under military dictatorship, highlighting the relationship between abortion and authoritarianism may be particularly galvanizing.</p>\n\n<h2>Limits of framing abortion as an individual right</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18\">Roe v. Wade in 1973</a> recognized abortion as a private medical decision between “<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/roe-v-wade\">the woman and her responsible physician</a>” up to the point of fetal viability − roughly around 24 to 26 weeks − and that framing has stuck.</p>\n\n<p>This was basically what the mainstream pro-choice movement advocated for at the time. White feminists saw abortion rights <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/pro-choice-movement\">as a personal liberty</a>. This framing has real limitations.</p>\n\n<p>As Black and brown <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/reproductive-justice/paper\">reproductive justice advocates</a> have long pointed out, Roe <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/07/30/fetal-viability-missouri-abortion-amendment/\">never served women of color or poor people particularly well</a> because of underlying unequal access to health care. Their work has, for decades, illustrated the strong connection between racial, economic and reproductive justice, yet abortion is still largely regarded as solely an individual issue.</p>\n\n<p>When debates about reproductive freedoms are framed as fights over individual rights, it can engender a legal quagmire. Other entities with rights emerge – the fetus, for example, or a potential grandparent – and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2012.675046\">are pitted against the pregnant person</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, for instance, a pregnant woman declared brain dead in Georgia <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/05/21/adriana-smith-died-3-months-ago-georgia-could-make-smiths-family-pay-to-use-her-as-a-human-incubator/\">was kept alive for several months</a> until her fetus became viable, apparently to comply with the state’s strict anti-abortion law. As her <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/funeral-plans-adriana-smith-georgia-mom-delivered-baby-life-support-brain-dead/85-d0fce1e8-f37e-4a2f-a043-a64da11c2f13\">mother told the press</a>, her family had no say in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Narrowly focusing on abortion as an individual right can also obscure why banning it has societal impacts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19609407/\">Research worldwide</a> shows that restricting reproductive freedoms <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/05/27/1099739656/do-restrictive-abortion-laws-actually-reduce-abortion-a-global-map-offers-insigh\">does not</a> lead to fewer abortions. Abortion bans only make abortion dangerous as people turn to unregulated “back alley” procedures. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d9z853jndo\">Maternal and infant mortality rates rise</a>, especially in marginalized communities.</p>\n\n<p>Simply stated: More women and babies <a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/09/16/infant-mortality-rises-in-states-with-restrictive-abortion-laws-new-research/\">die when abortion and contraception laws become more restrictive</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other kinds of suffering increase, too. Women and their families tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224241292058\">become poorer</a> when contraception and abortion are hard to get.</p>\n\n<p>Abortion bans also lead to discriminatory practices in health care beyond reproductive health services, such as <a href=\"https://phr.org/our-work/resources/cascading-harms-how-abortion-bans-lead-to-discriminatory-care-across-medical-specialties/\">oncology, neurology and cardiology</a>. Physicians who fear criminalization are forced to withhold or alter gold-standard treatments for pregnant patients, for example, or they may prescribe less effective drugs out of concern about legal consequences should patients later become pregnant. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/06/04/what-is-emtala-how-trump-just-overrode-federal-law-on-emergency-abortions/\">Lifesaving procedures</a> in the emergency room must await a negative pregnancy test.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, abortion bans decrease the quality and effectiveness of medical care for many patients, not just those who are pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2>Defending reproductive freedoms for healthy democracies</h2>\n\n<p>These findings demonstrate why reproductive rights are really a collective good. When viewed this way, it illuminates why they are an essential element of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Already, the rollback of reproductive freedoms in the U.S. has been followed by efforts to limit other key areas of freedoms, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5421276/scotus-transgender-kids-decision\">LGBTQ rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.freedomforum.org/free-speech-facing-threats-2025/\">freedom of speech</a> and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-travel-ban-exceptions-immigrants-visa-4d5a4d07a4430dd1e1cf24511370bc0e\">right to travel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Access to safe abortion for pregnant people, gender-affirming care for trans youth, and international travel for noncitizens are intertwined rights – not isolated issues.</p>\n\n<p>When the government starts stripping away any of these rights, I believe it signals serious trouble for democracy.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://tracking.rewirenewsgroup.com/pixel.gif?utm_source=theconversation_com&amp;utm_medium=republished&amp;utm_content=2025-10_abortion-and-authoritarianism\" width=\"100%\" height=\"1\" style=\"height:1px;width:1px;border:0\"></iframe>\n\n<p><em>This story is published in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.rewirenewsgroup.com/\">Rewire News Group</a>, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to covering reproductive and sexual health.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265459/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Seda Saluk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-china-will-phase-down-coal-consumption-over-2026-2030-2021-04-22/\">phase down its coal use</a> between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"zVSIr\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zVSIr/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.</p>\n\n<h2>Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources</h2>\n\n<p>The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/russias-war-on-ukraine\">global energy crisis</a> as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/energy/repowereu_en\">broader REPowerEU</a> plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vqYwv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vqYwv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Renewables are now the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025/electricity\">leading source of electric power</a> in the EU, though <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/regions/europe/energy-mix\">natural gas and oil still account for more than half</a> of Europe’s total energy supply.</p>\n\n<p>The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/11/hungary-slovakia-under-pressure-as-us-and-eu-target-russia-with-energy-sanctions\">Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance</a> to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-tells-trump-dropping-russian-energy-destroy-economy-rcna233841\">Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas</a>.

Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/global-renewable-energy-investment-reaches-new-record-as-investors-reassess-risks/\">hit a record high in the first half of 2025</a>, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.</p>\n\n<h2>Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks</h2>\n\n<p>In November 2025, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">the Paris Agreement</a> to limit global temperature rise. </p>\n\n<p>The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while <a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/brazil-petrobras-oil-gas-expansion\">expanding oil and gas production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/brazil-environmental-agency-approves-petrobras-emergency-drill-results-foz-do-2025-09-24/\">exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas</a> region, the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake/about-the-global-stocktake/outcome-of-the-first-global-stocktake\">not on track</a> to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiators are expected to debate measures to <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/cop30-calls-on-accelerated-action-to-cut-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuels\">curb methane emissions</a> and support the <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/themes/climate-change/road-to-cop30-five-negotiation-outcomes-that-could-shape-global-finance/\">transition from fossil fuels</a>. But whether the discussions can eventually translate into a concrete global phaseout plan remains to be seen. Without credible plans to actually reduce fossil fuel dependence, the annual climate talks risk becoming another point of geopolitical tension.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266993/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kate Hua-Ke Chi does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

MAPLE would grab individual flies, safely move them into their own tiny mazes, and back out after I’d measured their behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>I’d been trying for months to modify MAPLE’s code. I finally got it running smoothly – and then on Day 1 of my 500-day experiment, MAPLE did not work.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMJYq8wTlAc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">MAPLE hard at work moving flies into Y-mazes.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>After a little bit of panic, and a lot of deep breathing, I decided to power through without the robot’s help. MAPLE’s refusal to cooperate was the first of many obstacles I faced as I continued my experiment for the next year and a half. During this time, I learned a lot about the building blocks of personality – as well as the challenges of doing scientific research and how to work around them.</p>\n\n<h2>Animals have personalities</h2>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JZNtXVEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">an evolutionary biologist</a> who studies animal behavior, I’m fascinated that no two individuals are completely alike. Think about the animal friends in your life — cats and <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/11/what-shapes-your-dogs-personality/\">dogs have unique personalities</a> and idiosyncrasies, whether it’s a specific food they hate or a particular way they like to nap.</p>\n\n<p>All animals – from the smallest worm to the biggest whale – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2012.62.6.4\">have personalities</a>: individual behavioral preferences that remain more or less stable throughout their lifetime. In <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, the fruit flies I worked with, individuality is evident <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64988\">in simple binary behaviors</a>. Individual flies show a preference for turning left or right, choosing a hot or cool environment, preferring brightly lit areas or the shade, and many other idiosyncrasies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.11.058\">Both nature and nurture</a> influence animal personality. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2015.00134\">The environment during development</a> can play a crucial role in some instances. In others, genes inherited from parents can drive preferences. In certain populations of fruit flies, for example, parents that like hot temperatures increase the chances that offspring prefer hot temperatures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"extreme closeup of a fruit fly headon, with big red eyes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=533&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=533&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696618/original/file-20251016-56-82i5s8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=533&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">All animals, including fruit flies, have individual preferences that are the building blocks of their personalities.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/extreme-detail-fruit-fly-royalty-free-image/501253632\">vasekk/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>It is also possible for genes to influence <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1503830112\">how much individuals differ</a> from each other. For instance, certain combinations of genes can lead individual fruit flies to have widely different <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12813\">temperature preferences</a>, with some liking colder temperatures and others preferring it warm. These genes determine how wide the range of temperatures an individual’s preferences are drawn from.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists have found genes that influence variation in traits in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2156-13-63\">many animals and plants</a>, so evolution seems to have kept them around for a reason. But what’s the benefit of a gene that makes individuals within a group different from each other?</p>\n\n<h2>The benefits of variation</h2>\n\n<p>An evolutionary theory <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.0176\">called bet-hedging</a> suggests that in an unpredictable environment, having options can be less risky. When conditions are fluctuating, there is no one behavior that is best suited for the environment. Variability-influencing genes can be adaptive in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>Take temperature preference, for example. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine that an organism can have either a low temperature-variability gene, which I will call low-var, or a high temperature-variability gene, high-var. Animals with the low-var gene have similar temperature preferences and can all survive and reproduce when the environment has stable, average temperatures. Comparatively, animals with high-var have very different temperature preferences from each other.</p>\n\n<p>When the environment has average, stable temperatures, the preference of some animals with the high-var gene may be a good fit for conditions. They’ll be able to reproduce, but many other high-var individuals may not.</p>\n\n<p>However, if temperatures fluctuate unpredictably, going below or above the average, all the low-var animals will be unfit and unable to pass on their genes. The low-var population would completely collapse. </p>\n\n<p>In the high-var group, no matter how the environment fluctuates, there would be some individuals whose particular temperature preference makes them able to survive, reproduce and pass on the high-var gene.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695670/original/file-20251010-56-co415f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=509&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Bet-hedging theory explains how a gene increasing variability can be beneficial when the environment fluctuates.

In fluctuating environments, a gene that makes the individuals variable across a certain trait, such as temperature preference, has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.08.005\">a better chance of persisting long term</a>. Populations with these kinds of bet-hedging genes can therefore have a higher chance of surviving in unpredictable environments.</p>\n\n<p>How can evolution shape this variation, and what kinds of genes are involved? To answer this question, I turned to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/selection\">artificial selection</a>. This process is akin to how humans have domesticated plants and animals for millennia. An experimenter screens individuals from a population for a trait of interest, and only those that meet a certain threshold are allowed to reproduce to create the next generation. Instead of nature deciding who survives, the researcher chooses.</p>\n\n<h2>Variability in behavior responds to evolution</h2>\n\n<p>To evolve high variability, I picked a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1500804112\">simple behavior: turn bias</a>. When given a choice to turn left or right in a Y-shaped maze, some flies almost always choose left, others almost always choose right, and others choose left sometimes and right sometimes. These preferences remain stable over their lifetime, and their genetic background plays a role in determining it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a fly is at the top of a white upside-down Y in a circular container\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=534&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695683/original/file-20251010-56-wesn7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=671&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Which way will the fruit fly go, left or right?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Shraddha Lall</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While the particular turn bias is not inherited – a left-turning mom and a left-turning dad don’t necessarily make left-turning fly babies – the variability in turn bias can be influenced by genes. This potential for variability can be considered the fly’s “personality” – whether that’s a strong preference for one direction or a more flexible approach.</p>\n\n<p>For 21 generations, I used video and a type of AI called computer vision to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224243\">track thousands of flies</a>. I focused on siblings that shared a mother. If a sibling group made very similar turn choices, they likely had low-variability genes. If a group of siblings was mixed in terms of how biased they were for turning left or right, it was likely their lineage had a high-variability gene.</p>\n\n<p>The next step was the artificial selection. I’d choose the families most likely to have the high-variability genes to mate and produce the next generation. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4EAa3yIJRU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Computer vision can track individual flies in mazes and record their movements.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>At the end of my experiment, I had evolved populations with very high levels of turn-bias variability. My results showed that variability in traits and increased individuality in behaviors can evolve in response to selection, definitely in the lab and potentially also in nature.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I’m working on figuring out what happened to their genes as the flies evolved, and how their bodies and brains might have changed when I forced them onto this evolutionary path. </p>\n\n<h2>Creating a world where bet-hedging dominates</h2>\n\n<p>I now knew that increased behavioral individuality can evolve. That is, flies can evolve differing personalities driven by selection. Could I recreate in the lab the environmental conditions that would lead to this evolution in nature?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.245751\">Fruit flies are ectotherms</a>, meaning they need to get heat from external sources. Their temperature preference ensures that they find a suitable environment to live and lay eggs in. In a world with increasing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58544-5\">unpredictability in temperatures</a>, bet-hedging strategies may evolve as animals adapt.</p>\n\n<p>Based on bet-hedging theory, I hypothesized that evolving in an unpredictable thermal environment in the lab, with temperatures fluctuating over generations, would lead to the evolution of higher variability in temperature preferences.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, a labmate and I began creating houses for flies where we could control temperatures of different areas and change them over time. Unfortunately, time and logistics stopped this experiment, and it sits in storage now. I hope to continue this work someday.</p>\n\n<p>My fly experiments taught me a lot about how animal behavior evolves, and also a lot about the process of doing research. There have been two constants – first, sometimes things don’t work out, and that’s OK. And second, regardless of the challenges – including broken robots, long hours and paused experiments – I want to keep exploring how evolution can shape personality as animals adapt to changing environments.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261615/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shraddha Lall was affiliated with The Conversation U.S. as a AAAS Mass Media Science Fellow for summer 2025. </span></em></p>",

Although there have been significant advances in imaging and monitoring technologies, the stethoscope remains a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa343\">quick, accessible and cost-effective tool</a> for assessing a patient’s health. </p>\n\n<p>Though stethoscopes remain useful today, audible symptoms of disease often <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911365\">appear only at later stages of illness</a>. At that point, treatments are less likely to work and outcomes are often poor. This is especially the case for heart disease, where changes in heart sounds are not always clearly defined and may be difficult to hear.</p>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9sHVoAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">are scientists</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nzq4Ci8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and engineers</a> who are exploring ways to use heart sounds to detect disease earlier and more accurately. Our research suggests that combining stethoscopes with artificial intelligence could help doctors be less reliant on the human ear to diagnose heart disease, leading to more timely and effective treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>History of the stethoscope</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201605-411PS\">invention of the stethoscope</a> is widely credited to the 19th-century French physician René Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec. Before the stethoscope, physicians often placed their ear directly on a patient’s chest to listen for abnormalities in breathing and heart sounds. </p>\n\n<p>In 1816, a young girl showing symptoms of heart disease sought consultation with Laënnec. Placing his ear on her chest, however, was considered socially inappropriate. Inspired by children transmitting sounds through a long wooden stick, he instead rolled a sheet of paper to listen to her heart. He was surprised by the sudden clarity of the heart sounds, and the first stethoscope was born. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Wooden tube with writing wrapped around one side\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696347/original/file-20251015-66-tjm3y8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=629&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One of René Laënnec’s original wooden stethoscopes.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co90986/\">Science Museum London/Science and Society Picture Library</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Over the next couple of decades, researchers modified the shape of this early stethoscope to improve its comfort, portability and sound transmission. This includes the addition of a thin, flat membrane called a diaphragm that vibrates and amplifies sound.</p>\n\n<p>The next major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1850s, when Irish physician Arthur Leared and American physician George Philip Cammann developed stethoscopes that could transmit sounds to both ears. These <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28171\">binaural stethoscopes</a> use two flexible tubes connected to separate earpieces, allowing clearer and more balanced sound by reducing outside noise.</p>\n\n<p>These early models are remarkably similar to the stethoscopes medical doctors use today, with only slight modifications mainly designed for user comfort.</p>\n\n<h2>Listening to the heart</h2>\n\n<p>Medical schools continue to teach the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10904\">art of auscultation</a> – the use of sound to assess the function of the heart, lungs and other organs. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjdh/ztab059\">Digital models</a> of stethoscopes, which have been commercially available since the early 2000s, offer new tools like sound amplification and recording – yet the basic principle that Laënnec introduced endures.</p>\n\n<p>When listening to the heart, doctors pay close attention to the familiar <a href=\"https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/17%3A_Cardiovascular_System%3A_The_Heart/17.4%3A_Physiology_of_the_Heart/17.4C%3A_Heart_Sounds\">“lub-dub” rhythm of each heartbeat</a>. The first sound – the lub – happens when the valves between the upper and lower chambers of the heart close as it contracts and pushes blood out to the body. The second sound – the dub – occurs when the valves leading out of the heart close as the heart relaxes and refills with blood. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of stethoscope\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=432&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=432&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=432&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=543&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=543&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696346/original/file-20251015-56-c3p8g1.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=543&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The diaphragm and bell of a stethoscope transmit different sound frequencies to the listener.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stethoscope.svg\">Jarould/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Along with these two normal sounds, doctors also listen for <a href=\"https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Abnormal_heart_sounds\">unusual noises</a> – such as murmurs, extra beats or clicks – that can point to problems with how blood is flowing or whether the heart valves are working properly. </p>\n\n<p>Heart sounds can vary greatly <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17083-heart-murmur\">depending on the type of heart disease present</a>. Sometimes, different diseases produce the same abnormal sound. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK345/\">systolic murmur</a> – an extra sound between first and second heart sounds – may be heard with narrowing of either the aortic or pulmonary valve. Yet the very same murmur can also appear when the heart is structurally normal and healthy. This overlap makes it challenging to diagnose disease based solely on the presence of murmurs.</p>\n\n<h2>Teaching AI to hear what people can’t</h2>\n\n<p>AI technology can identify the hidden differences in the sounds of healthy and damaged hearts and use them to diagnose disease before traditional acoustic changes like murmurs even appear. Instead of relying on the presence of extra or abnormal sounds to diagnose disease, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.13535\">AI can detect differences in sound</a> that are too faint or subtle for the human ear to detect. </p>\n\n<p>To build these algorithms, researchers record heart sounds using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s135882\">digital stethoscopes</a>. These stethoscopes convert sound into electronic signals that can be amplified, stored and analyzed using computers. Researchers can then label which sounds are normal or abnormal to train an algorithm to recognize patterns in the sounds it can then use to predict whether new sounds are normal or abnormal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor holding stethoscope to patient's chest\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696348/original/file-20251015-56-2vjdgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stethoscopes can capture diagnostic information the human ear alone cannot hear.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/healthcare-professional-listening-to-elderly-womans-royalty-free-image/2232288705\">Drs Producoes/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Researchers are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.036882\">developing algorithms that can analyze</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.019905\">digitally recorded heart sounds</a> in combination with digital stethoscopes as a low-cost, noninvasive and accessible tool to screen for heart disease. However, a lot of these algorithms are built on datasets of moderate-to-severe heart disease.

Most importantly, our algorithm is able to detect early stages of disease, before cardiac murmurs or structural changes appear.</p>\n\n<p>We believe teaching AI to hear what humans can’t could transform how doctors diagnose and respond to heart disease.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267373/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Valentina Dargam receives funding from Florida Heart Research Foundation and National Institute of Health. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Hutcheson receives funding from the Florida Heart Research Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p>",

Puerto Rico may belong to the U.S. – and many Puerto Ricans embrace that special relationship – but the island itself does not sound or feel like the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>The over <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/us-hispanics-facts-on-puerto-rican-origin-latinos/\">5.8 million Puerto Ricans that reside in the 50 states</a> further complicate that picture. While legally they are U.S. citizens, mainstream Americans often don’t see Puerto Ricans that way. In fact, a 2017 poll found that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/upshot/nearly-half-of-americans-dont-know-people-in-puerto-ricoans-are-fellow-citizens.html\">only 54% of Americans</a> knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. </p>\n\n<h2>The alien-citizen paradox</h2>\n\n<p>Puerto Ricans exist in what we describe as the “<a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/faculty_publications/317/\">alien-citizen paradox</a>”: They are U.S. citizens, but only those residing in the mainland enjoy all the rights of citizenship. </p>\n\n<p>A recent congressional report stated that U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans “is not equal, permanent, irrevocable citizenship protected by the 14th Amendment … and <a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/faculty_publications/317/\">Congress retains the right to determine the disposition of the territory</a>.” Any U.S. citizen that moves to Puerto Rico no longer possesses the full rights of U.S. citizens of the mainland. </p>\n\n<p>Bad Bunny’s selection for the Super Bowl halftime show illustrates this paradox. In addition to criticisms from public figures, there were <a href=\"https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/maga-call-bad-bunny-deportation-1434541\">widespread calls among MAGA influencers to deport the rapper</a> </p>\n\n<p>This is but one way Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latino citizens, are reminded of their status as “others.” </p>\n\n<p>ICE apprehensions of people merely <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-born-citizen-sues-after-arrested-immigration-agents/story?id=126129734\">appearing to be an immigrant</a> – a tactic that was recently <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a169_5h25.pdf\">given the blessing of the Supreme Court</a> – is an example of their alienlike status. </p>\n\n<p>And the bulk of the ICE raids have occurred in predominantly Latino communities in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQorZkydOR8\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/show/newshour/\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/immigration-enforcement-nyc-trump-administration/\">New York</a>. This has forced many Latino communities to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1u3pG3RHWM\">cancel Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Bad Bunny’s global reach</h2>\n\n<p>The xenophobic fervor against Bad Bunny has led political leaders like <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5544018-bad-bunny-super-bowl-mike-johnson/\">House Speaker Mike Johnson</a> to call for a more suitable figure for the Super Bowl, such as country music artist Lee Greenwood. Referring to Bad Bunny, Johnson said “it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.”</p>\n\n<p>But the facts counter that claim. The Puerto Rican artist sits <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/07/10/how-bad-bunny-leapt-to-the-top-of-the-global-music-charts\">atop the global music charts</a>. He has <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">over 80 million monthly Spotify listeners</a>. And he has sold nearly <a href=\"https://chartmasters.org/bad-bunny-albums-and-songs-sales/\">five times</a> more albums than <a href=\"https://leegreenwood.com/lee-greenwood-honored-with-25-million-albums-sold-worldwide-plaque-at-grand-ole-opry/\">Greenwood</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That global appeal has impressed the NFL, which hopes to host as many as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/21/g-s1-38443/latinos-growing-fanbase-nfl\">eight international games next season</a>. Additionally, Latinos represent the league’s fastest-growing fan base, and Mexico is its largest international market, with a reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/21/g-s1-38443/latinos-growing-fanbase-nfl\">39.5 million fans</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Bad Bunny Super Bowl saga may actually become an important political moment. Conservatives, in their efforts to highlight Bad Bunny’s “otherness” – despite the <a href=\"https://wearemitu.com/wearemitu/culture/the-us-worlds-second-spanish-speaking-nation/0\">United States being the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world</a> – may have unwittingly educated America on the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans. </p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Puerto Ricans and the rest of the U.S. Latino community continue to wonder when they’ll be accepted as social equals.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267078/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This is despite growing availability of a <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep\">highly effective HIV prevention medication</a> that has made it possible to live a long, healthy life with this once fatal disease.</p>\n\n<p>This medication – called <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis\">preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP</a> – reduces the risk of HIV transmission by over 99% when taken as prescribed. Yet, in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, one of the most vulnerable populations – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/half-of-black-gay-men-will-be-diagnosed-with-hiv-despite-highly-effective-preventive-treatments-why-236992\">Black men who have sex with men</a> – are rarely using it, with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08914-2\">fewer than 1 in 5</a> who are eligible taking the drug. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-27/trump-hiv-cuts-restored-funding-surpasses\">previously frozen</a> <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/the-week-in-brief-trump-hiv-funding-cuts/\">and proposed more cuts</a> to HIV prevention programs in the U.S. And although the administration has restored some of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5288113/cdc-website-health-data-trump\">federal webpages and datasets it took down</a> in January 2025, it is unclear what information remains missing or has changed. Communities in the South that already face the highest burden of infection will feel the greatest effects of changing public health priorities.</p>\n\n<p>In my work as a <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/bmnabors.php\">public health researcher</a>, I have spent years studying HIV prevention and the social determinants of health in the Deep South. Through interviews with health care providers and Black patients in major Southern cities, what I learned was that a powerful clash between culture and public health plays a significant role in why effective medical treatments are still failing to reach those who need it most. I call this tension the <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/central/docview/3097997926/CA453CB5E2874464PQ\">Southern paradox</a> – where medical solutions exist but systemic forces block access.</p>\n\n<p>The stories of these clinicians and patients in the South weren’t simply about a pill: They were about trust, identity, family and faith. And their words highlighted a complex web of emotions and experiences that often go unaddressed in standard health messaging.</p>\n\n<h2>Southern culture and sexual health</h2>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/central/docview/3097997926/CA453CB5E2874464PQ\">recent study</a>, I interviewed 12 people in Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta: eight Black <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/men-who-have-sex-with-men-originated-during-the-hiv-pandemic-to-focus-on-behavior-rather-than-identity-but-not-everyone-thinks-the-term-helps-189619\">men who have sex with men</a>, along with four health care providers. Three of these providers also identified as men who have sex with men.</p>\n\n<p>Many participants reported that physical access to PrEP wasn’t the issue. Instead, what stood in the way was far more personal and deeply embedded in their environment.</p>\n\n<p>“In church, you’re taught to love your neighbor, but there’s always an asterisk when it comes to who you love,” one participant from Jackson told me. “If you’re gay, you’re either ignored or silently judged.”</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all participants described the South as a place deeply <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.7\">shaped by conservative values</a>, especially those rooted in religion and traditional family structures. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-the-black-churchs-diversity-and-its-vital-role-in-american-political-history-197511\">Black church</a> emerged as both a protective factor and a challenge. While offering vital community support, it also often reinforced stigma around homosexuality and discouraged open conversations about sexual health.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOSN1bKG3zQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Tackling HIV in the South takes a village.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One participant from New Orleans shared that he heard about PrEP from his health care provider and his friends, while another from Atlanta recalled learning about PrEP during his annual physical. Despite repeatedly being exposed to information about PrEP, both described hesitation about starting treatment. One worried about potential stigma if others discovered he was taking it, while the other questioned whether he “really needed” it. Ultimately, neither had started PrEP.</p>\n\n<p>In many of these communities, sex education in schools is still focused on abstinence and often excludes LGBTQ+ topics entirely. “You grow up not hearing anything about gay sex or HIV,” one man from Memphis said. “So, when you get older, it’s like starting from scratch.”</p>\n\n<p>Even decisions around condom use were heavily shaped by cultural norms. Men described relying on partner trust, age or perceived cleanliness rather than <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/basics-hiv-prevention\">research-based ways to reduce the risk of HIV</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This absence of <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education\">comprehensive, inclusive sex education</a> leaves many vulnerable to misinformation and, ultimately, to preventable infections.</p>\n\n<h2>Trust is the real barrier</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most striking findings from these conversations was the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/many-black-americans-arent-rushing-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-a-long-history-of-medical-abuse-suggests-why-152368\">deep mistrust</a> that many Black men who have sex with men feel toward the health care system. </p>\n\n<p>“It’s hard to find affirming care for people in the queer community,” said one Memphis-based health provider. Others talked about fears of being “outed” through their insurance, especially if they were still on a family health plan.</p>\n\n<p>A Jackson-based participant confided, “Some people avoid taking [PrEP] because for each prescription you are required to be evaluated. Some people don’t want the follow-up or the screening.” Another noted how fear of both outright and subtle <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/heteronormativity-in-health-care-is-harmful-for-lgbtq-patients-and-a-source-of-tension-for-queer-and-trans-doctors-200503\">judgment during medical appointments</a> made it easier to avoid health care altogether.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Patient greeting a person working at a clinic with open arms\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696253/original/file-20251014-56-4t7dey.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A welcoming health care environment can make all the difference.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/after-missing-recent-appointments-due-to-family-emergencies-news-photo/1186383780\">Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Systemic racism compounds these concerns. For many Black men, historical and ongoing <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/do-implicit-bias-trainings-on-race-improve-health-care-not-yet-but-incorporating-the-latest-science-can-help-hospitals-treat-all-patients-equitably-226289\">experiences of discrimination</a>, including rushed visits, lack of empathy, misdiagnoses and even being denied care altogether have built a lasting sense of caution.</p>\n\n<p>Even when resources like PrEP are available, these treatments often feel inaccessible to Black men because they do not trust the system offering them.</p>\n\n<h2>Social networks step in</h2>\n\n<p>Thankfully, these conversations also uncovered moments of hope. </p>\n\n<p>Many participants learned about PrEP from peers. “We talk about it regularly,” said one participant in Jackson. “I have friends who work in public health, along with friends who are taking the medication.”</p>\n\n<p>In the South, where community ties often serve as critical safety nets, these social networks can sometimes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-016-1413-y\">provide more trusted health information</a> than clinics or campaigns. Informal conversations in group chats, at house parties or during community gatherings often serve as powerful platforms for health promotion. </p>\n\n<p>One provider in Atlanta said he intentionally shared his own experiences with PrEP to reduce stigma. “I have a little soreness,” he said with a smile, referring to a recent injection. “Then I tell everyone, ‘Yup, I just got mine.’ The casualness of that comment made a difference: It made PrEP feel normal, relatable, something for ‘us,’ not something done to ‘them.’”</p>\n\n<p>These social exchanges, rooted in trust and shared experience, frequently did more to shift attitudes than traditional public health campaigns. As one participant put it, “I trust my friends more than those ads. If they’re taking it and it works for them, that means something to me.”</p>\n\n<h2>Making PrEP culturally relevant</h2>\n\n<p>What these conversations show is that for PrEP to work in the South, access to treatment is only part of the equation. Building trust, cultural affirmation and community-led education are equally critical.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mpox-aids-and-covid-19-show-the-challenges-of-targeting-public-health-messaging-to-specific-groups-without-causing-stigma-188328\">Public health messages</a> that go beyond medical facts and address the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of health are more likely to build lasting engagement with HIV prevention. This includes investing in Black, LGBTQ+-affirming health care providers who <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/minority-patients-benefit-from-having-minority-doctors-but-thats-a-hard-match-to-make-130504\">reflect the communities they serve</a>. It also means integrating discussions of sexual health into everyday conversations at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/barbershop-talks-a-safe-place-to-discuss-black-masculinity-99985\">barbershops</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-churches-be-protectors-of-public-health-176949\">churches</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-more-public-libraries-are-doubling-as-food-distribution-hubs-160674\">community centers</a>, not just in clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Public health officials and clinicians can explore alternative treatment delivery methods that address privacy concerns, such as telehealth PrEP programs, discreet mail-order services and community-based distribution points. These can make PrEP easier to access and reduce the stigma associated with clinic visits.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, valuing the knowledge already circulating within communities and supporting peer educators as legitimate public health messengers can strengthen credibility, normalize PrEP and empower people to take charge of their health.</p>\n\n<p>In the battle against HIV in the South, culture is not just a barrier. It can also be the solution. I believe that when care is offered in a way that honors people’s identities, experiences and values, it becomes not just accessible but empowering.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257434/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brandon Nabors does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Suddenly, a horde of ragged, bloodied creatures appear, their feet shuffling along the pavement, their hollow eyes locked on fleeing figures ahead.</p>\n\n<p>A classic movie monster, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20131025-zombie-nation\">the zombie surged in popularity</a> in the 21st century during a time of global anxiety – the Great Recession, the specter of climate change, the lingering trauma of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The zombie apocalypse became a way for people to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137276506_9\">explore the terrifying concept of societal collapse</a>, a step removed from real threats such as nuclear war or global financial disaster.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://fairbanks.indianapolis.iu.edu/about/directory/duszynski-thomas.html\">public health epidemiologist</a> and an amateur zombie historian, I couldn’t help but notice the striking parallels between what epidemiologists do to stop infectious disease outbreaks and what horror movie heroes do to stop zombies. The key questions posed in any zombie narrative – how did this start, how many are infected, how to contain it – are the identical questions that epidemiologists ask during a real infectious disease outbreak or pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>In 2011, in fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a <a href=\"https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/12125\">zombie apocalypse preparedness guide</a> that explained how readying oneself for a zombie apocalypse can prepare people for any large-scale disaster. The zombie is more than just a monster; it is a powerful, public health teaching tool.</p>\n\n<h2>Zombies in ancient history</h2>\n\n<p>The idea of the reanimated dead has been part of human history for millennia, showing up across cultures and long before <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-1108-7_3\">modern germ theory or epidemiology existed</a>. These creatures were often a way for societies to understand and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1905.ad1905\">explain the natural world and disease transmission</a> in the absence of scientific knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2018.1441216\">oldest written reference</a> to creatures similar to modern zombies is found in “<a href=\"https://uruk-warka.dk/Gilgamish/The%20Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh.pdf\">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>,” which was etched on stone tablets sometime between 2000 and 1100 B.C.E. Enraged after Gilgamesh rejects her marriage proposal, the goddess Ishtar tells him, “I shall bring up the dead to consume the living, I shall the make the dead outnumber the living.” This ancient terror – the dead overwhelming the living – has a direct parallel to the concept of an out-of-control epidemic in which the sick quickly overwhelm the healthy. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066129256/\">Hollywood has readily adopted this concept</a> in many zombie movies. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A screenshot for the trailer of Night of the Living Dead\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696287/original/file-20251014-56-nkys3t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=559&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The creatures in George Romero’s 1968 classic ‘The Night of the Living Dead’ were the first flesh-eating zombies in Hollywood.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Night_Of_The_Living_Dead_trailer_screenshot.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The origins of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/3-things-i-learned-from-teaching-students-about-horror-pioneer-george-romeros-movies-during-these-scary-times-148614\">flesh-eating corpse on screen</a> date back to George Romero’s 1968 classic “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/\">The Night of the Living Dead</a>.” You won’t hear the word “zombie” in Romero’s film, however – in the script, <a href=\"https://assets.scriptslug.com/live/pdf/scripts/night-of-the-living-dead-1968.pdf\">he called the creatures</a> “flesh eaters.” Similarly, in Danny Boyle’s 2002 film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/\">28 Days Later</a>,” the terrifying creatures were called the “infected.” Both these terms, “flesh eaters” and “infected,” <a href=\"https://mymythstories.com/zombies-origin/\">directly echo public health concerns</a> – specifically, the spread of disease via a bacteria or virus and the need for quarantine to contain the afflicted. </p>\n\n<p>The roots of the word zombie arefor the Haitian variety. thought to stretch back to West Africa and to words such as “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786459117\">nzambi,” which means “creator” in African Kongo</a>, or “<a href=\"https://vodouinhaiti.wordpress.com/zonbi/\">ndzumbi,” which means “corpse” in the Mitsogo language</a> of Gabon. However, it was in Haitian Vodou, <a href=\"https://sites.udel.edu/movingfictions/the-books/american-street/vodou-2/\">a religion that draws from the West African spiritual traditions</a> among people who were enslaved on Haiti’s plantations, that the concept took its <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30875163/\">most terrifying form</a>. </p>\n\n<p>According to Vodou, when a person experiences an unnatural, early death, priests can capture and co-opt their soul. Slave owners capitalized on this belief to <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-transatlantic-zombie/9780813568836/\">prevent suicide among the enslaved</a>. To become a zombie – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html\">dead yet still a slave</a> – was the ultimate nightmare. This cultural concept speaks not just to disease but to societal trauma and the public health crisis of forced labor.</p>\n\n<h2>Zombie-like creatures around the world</h2>\n\n<p>Across the globe, other <a href=\"https://www.edodyssey.com/blog/2024/9/16/our-haunted-world\">reanimated corpses crop up in local folklore</a>, often reflecting fears of improper burial, violent death or moral wickedness. Many tales about these eerie creatures don’t just convey how to avoid becoming one of them, but also detail how to stop or prevent them from taking over. This focus on prevention and control is at the heart of public health.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A white-faced big-toothed monster wearing a long black robe and holding up its hands\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=915&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=915&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=915&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1150&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1150&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696284/original/file-20251014-56-9h5kjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1150&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jiangshi, or hopping zombies, were corpses reanimated when a soul couldn’t leave after a violent death.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://sleepingdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Jiang_Shi\">Ed5005000 via Sleeping Dogs Wiki</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>During the expansion of <a href=\"https://pressbooks.claremont.edu/onesource/chapter/the-qing-dynasty/\">China’s Qing dynasty</a>, which took place between 1644 and 1911, a creature known as the jiangshi, or “hopping zombie,” emerged amid <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0289748\">widespread unrest and integration of non-Chinese minorities</a>. The jiangshi were <a href=\"https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Jiangshi\">corpses suffering from rigor mortis and decomposition</a>, reanimated when a soul couldn’t leave after a violent death. Instead of staggering, these mythological creatures would hop, and their method of attack was to steal a person’s lifeforce, or qi. </p>\n\n<p>Fear of a lonely, restless afterlife led families who lost a loved one far from home <a href=\"https://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/article/the-hopping-dead-the-corpse-walkers-of-china/\">to hire a Taoist priest to retrieve the body</a> for proper burial with ancestors. </p>\n\n<p>In Scandinavia, the draugr – meaning “again walker” or “ghost” – <a href=\"https://thewickedgriffin.com/draugr-norse-mythology/\">was a creature bent on revenge</a>. According to lore, draugrs typically emerged from mean-spirited people or improperly buried corpses. Like zombies, they could turn regular people into draugrs by infecting them. They would attack their victims by devouring flesh, drinking blood or driving victims insane. Draugrs’ contagious nature is a model for disease transmission. What’s more, their seasonal activity – they most often appear at night in winter months –  is similar to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3604842/\">seasonal trends in infectious disease transmission</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white drawing of a giant monster hovering over a house at night\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=750&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696279/original/file-20251014-66-i2t0vt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=943&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The draugr’s ability to ‘infect’ people can be seen as an example of disease transmission.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_draugr_by_Kim_Diaz_Holm_(cropped).jpg\">Kim Diaz Holm</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In medieval times, meanwhile, legend had it that creatures called revenants – corpses that came out of their graves – stalked northern and western Europe. According to 12th-century English historian William of Newburgh, these creatures <a href=\"https://historycollection.com/dealing-undead-five-supposed-vampire-graves-around-world/\">emerged from the lingering life force</a> of people who had committed evil deeds during their lives or who experienced a sudden death. Clerics <a href=\"https://repository.wellesley.edu/_flysystem/fedora/2024-06/wctc_2024_patiencelunasylvia_godandcarrion_access.pdf\">fueled people’s fears of becoming a revenant</a> by claiming these creatures were created by Satan. The recommended but gruesome prevention method for this fate was to <a href=\"https://historycollection.com/dealing-undead-five-supposed-vampire-graves-around-world/\">capture and dismember these creatures</a> and to burn the body parts, especially the head.</p>\n\n<p>Archaeological evidence from a medieval village in England suggests that communities heeded this advice. Archaeologists excavated the village’s burial grounds, and among human remains from the 11th to 13th centuries they found <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/news/archaeological-evidence-living-dead-in-mediaeval-england/\">broken and burned bones with knife marks</a>. They show how a community may have taken extreme measures to control a perceived contagion or threat to public safety, mirroring a modern-day quarantine or eradication protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most striking similarity between these historical monsters and Hollywood zombies is that so many of them are created by an infectious agent of some kind. After an outbreak occurs, control is difficult to regain, underscoring the necessity of a rapid public health response.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tom Duszynski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But for some people, the best way to stay in their community, adapt to the changing climate and recover from disasters is to do what humans <a href=\"https://www.zmescience.com/science/archaeology/this-ancient-greek-city-was-swallowed-by-the-sea-and-yet-refused-to-die/\">have done for millennia</a>: move.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers expect <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374171735/onthemove/\">millions of Americans</a> to relocate from properties facing increasing risks of flood, fire and other kinds of disasters in the years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>What people do with those high-risk properties can make their community more resilient or leave it vulnerable to more damage in future storms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A home with series of signs reading: 'Houses below this sign subject to flooding at any time. 9 times in 6 years.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695694/original/file-20251010-56-wqi8hu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Signs warn potential homebuyers about flooding problems in a neighborhood of Myrtle Beach, S.C., in 2022.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/signs-warn-potential-homebuyers-about-flooding-issues-in-news-photo/1244230034?adppopup=true\">Madeline Gray/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>We study <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vu9kFXEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">flood</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.rice.edu/staff/debolina-banerjee\">resilience</a> and have been mapping the results of government buyout programs across the U.S. that purchase damaged homes after disasters to turn them into open space. </p>\n\n<p>Our new <a href=\"https://cfar.rice.edu/fema-funded-buyouts-2007-2017\">national maps of who relocates and where</a> they go after a flood shows that most Americans who move from buyout areas stay local. However, we also found that the majority of them give up their home to someone else, either selling it or leaving a rental home, rather than taking a government buyout offer. That transfers the risk to a new resident, leaving the community still facing future costly risks.</p>\n\n<h2>FEMA’s buyout program at risk</h2>\n\n<p>Government buyout programs can help communities recover after disasters by purchasing high-risk homes and demolishing them. The parcel is then converted to a natural flood plain, park or site for new infrastructure to mitigate future flood damage for nearby areas. </p>\n\n<p>FEMA has been funding such efforts for decades through its <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN11911\">property buyout program</a>. It has invested nearly US$4 billion to purchase and raze approximately 45,000 flood-prone homes nationwide, most of them since 2001.</p>\n\n<p>Those investments pay off: Research shows the program avoids an estimated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2020.100246\">$4 to $6 in future disaster recovery spending for every $1 invested</a>. In return, homeowners receive a predisaster price for their home, minus any money they might receive from a related flood insurance payout on the property.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Flooding surrounds homes across a large area\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695692/original/file-20251010-56-5p49oi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Young trees along Briar Creek in Charlotte, N.C., are part of a successful local flood plain buyout program to purchase property in flood-prone areas and return it to nature.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/young-trees-are-protected-at-the-chantilly-ecological-news-photo/1184946073?adppopup=true\">Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But this assistance is now in jeopardy as the Trump administration cuts FEMA staff and funding and the president talks about <a href=\"https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2025/06/11/331113.htm\">dismantling the agency</a>. From March to September, governors submitted 42 applications for funding from FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which includes buyouts – <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/09/fema-disaster-relief-fund-drf-budget-hurting-states?lang=en\">all were denied or left pending</a> as of mid-September.</p>\n\n<p>Our recommendation after studying this program is to mend it, not end it. If done right, buyouts can help maintain local ties and help communities build more sustainable futures together. </p>\n\n<h2>Buyouts vs. selling homes in damaged areas</h2>\n\n<p>Our team at Rice University’s <a href=\"https://cfar.rice.edu/\">Center for Coastal Futures and Adaptive Resilience</a> developed an <a href=\"https://cfar.rice.edu/fema-funded-buyouts-2007-2017\">interactive mapping tool</a> to show where buyout participants and neighbors living within a half-mile of them moved after FEMA initiates a buyout program in their area.</p>\n\n<p>The maps were created using individual data, down to the address level, from 2007 to 2017, across more than 550 counties where FEMA’s buyout program operated nationally.</p>\n\n<p>Zoomed out, they show just how many places the program has helped across the U.S., from coastal cities to inland towns. And, when zoomed in, they reveal the buyout locations and destinations of more than 70,000 residents who moved following FEMA-funded buyouts in their area.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A map shows buyouts in cities scattered across the country.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=313&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682792/original/file-20250730-56-218wsw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">FEMA’s buyout programs have helped homeowners and communities across the U.S., in almost every state.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://rice1.osn.mghpcc.org/crc-ssl/CFAR_MVP/Test/index.html\">James R.

This means most people are maintaining local ties, even as they relocate to adapt to rising climate risks.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all of the moves also end in safer homes with minimal to minor risk of future flooding. We checked using address-level <a href=\"https://riskfactor.com/\">flood factors</a> from the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit source of flood risk ratings that are now integrated <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/guides/climate-change-housing-impact/flood-risk\">into some online real estate websites</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But many homes in risky areas are still being resold or rented to new residents, leaving communities facing a game of climate roulette. </p>\n\n<p>How long that can continue will vary by neighborhood. Rising insurance costs, intensifying storms and growing awareness of flood risks are already <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/florida-cape-coal-home-prices-3f64a0df\">dampening home sales</a> in some communities − and thus opportunities to simply hand over one’s risk to someone else and move on.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. can create safer communities by expanding federal, state and local voluntary buyout programs. These programs allow communities to reduce future flood damage and collectively plan for safer uses of the vacated lands that emerge. </p>\n\n<p>Giving residents longer periods of time to participate after the damage could also help make the programs more attractive. This would provide property owners more flexibility in deciding when to sell and demolish their property, while still taking risky property off the market rather than handing the risk to new residents.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262211/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James R.

Many may violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\">Hatch Act</a>, the 1939 statute that limits partisan political activity by federal employees and agencies.

Government workers may not use their positions or public resources to influence elections, coerce individual behavior or engage in political advocacy. </p>\n\n<p>The law requires federal agencies to avoid the partisan fray and focus on serving the public rather than political agendas. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://osc.gov/Documents/Outreach%20and%20Training/Handouts/A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Hatch%20Act%20for%20Federal%20Employees.pdf\">The Office of Special Counsel</a>, which enforces the law, has been clear on this point. “The purpose of the Act,” <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Documents/Outreach%20and%20Training/Handouts/A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Hatch%20Act%20for%20Federal%20Employees.pdf\">says an Office of Special Counsel guide</a> written for federal employees, “is to maintain a federal workforce that is free from partisan political influence or coersion.” Government communication can inform, but it cannot campaign.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An email auto-reply from the Department of Education blaming the shutdown on Democrats.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=291&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696289/original/file-20251014-56-jvtthp.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=365&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An auto-reply to an email sent to the press staff at the U.S. Department of Education on Oct. 14, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet the shutdown has already produced multiple potential violations:</p>\n\n<p>• The Department of Education, according to a lawsuit, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">altered employees’ email auto-responses</a> – without consent – to say things like “the Democrats have shut the government down.” Such changes do more than convey impartial information. They compel employees to align themselves with institutionally imposed scripts. </p>\n\n<p>• Likewise, agencies including Health and Human Services and the Small Business Administration reportedly distributed or directed staff to adopt partisan <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/10/does-agency-messaging-blaming-democrats-government-shutdown-violate-hatch-act/408597/\">out-of-office auto-replies assigning blame to Democrats</a>. </p>\n\n<p>• The Department of Housing and Urban Development posted a banner on its official website stating that the “<a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/agency-shutdown-messaging-draws-hatch-act-antideficiency-act-challenges/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Radical Left are going to shut down the government</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Taken individually, each incident might provoke a Hatch Act complaint.

Agencies themselves, even under pressure, stayed neutral. </p>\n\n<p>This time, the administration is using the machinery of government to deliver partisan blame.</p>\n\n<p>The timing and <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-trump-administration-pushes-the-hatch-act-to-its-limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">similarity of messages</a> across departments seems coordinated. Housing and Urban Development posted a banner blaming Democrats the day before the shutdown began. Within hours, <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/agency-shutdown-messaging-draws-hatch-act-antideficiency-act-challenges/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">other agencies followed</a> using nearly identical language. </p>\n\n<p>More troubling are the reported <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">changes to federal employees’ auto-replies without their consent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These missives forced career civil servants, many of them furloughed, to become unwilling messengers for partisan ends. Federal agencies and their workers are supposed to serve everyone, not only those who support the party in power.</p>\n\n<p>And because the watchdogs who could enforce the legal boundary are also sidelined – the Office of Special Counsel is furloughed  – <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/education-department-altered-employees-emails-blame-shutdown-democrats-lawsuit-2025-10-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">complaints have nowhere to go</a>, at least for now. They simply land in unattended email inboxes.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal challenges and limits</h2>\n\n<p>Whether shutdown communications truly violate the Hatch Act – or related laws – is not yet clear. The <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-trump-administration-pushes-the-hatch-act-to-its-limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">administration could argue</a> that it’s not campaigning but merely explaining why services are suspended. As a <a href=\"https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-frankchurchinstitute/sam-martin/\">scholar of political communication and American democracy</a>, I believe that defense weakens when official messages explicitly assign partisan blame or name a political party.</p>\n\n<p>And not every political statement is a Hatch Act violation. The law allows employees to express views <a href=\"https://www.afge.org/article/a-2024-election-reminder-what-you-can-and-cannot-do-under-hatch-act/#:%7E:text=The%20Hatch%20Act%20is%20a,the%20Further%20Restricted%20Employees%20section\">off duty or in private contexts</a>, so long as they use their own phones and computers.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the Office of Special Counsel later finds violations, harm will likely persist. Once messages are posted or auto-replies sent, their effects can’t always be undone. And because ethics officials are furloughed, too, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-latest-shutdown-begins-trump/\">accountability will be delayed, if it comes at all</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Some employees are likely to claim their speech rights were violated by being forced to send partisan messages. This is an argument already at the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/05/nx-s1-5563182/shutdown-lawsuit-education-department-partisan-messages\">lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Government Employees</a> against the Education Department.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A sign on a door warns people that during a partial government shutdown, the IRS office will be closed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=390&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=491&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=491&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696273/original/file-20251014-66-7kf6af.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=491&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Doors at the Internal Revenue Service in a Seattle federal building are locked and a sign advises that the office will be closed during the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GovernmentShutdownExplainer/c07241aca7f546fe90decb8e685f70ae/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Elaine Thompson</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why this matters</h2>\n\n<p>Federal agencies exist to <a href=\"https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Resources/A+Refresher+on+the+Impartiality+Rule\">administer laws impartially</a> and to do so on behalf of the people. </p>\n\n<p>When the government uses its own infrastructure for partisan messaging, the very neutrality on which democratic governance depends erodes.

It’s one thing to believe false information, but another to actively stick with something that’s obviously wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Our new research, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggests that some people consider it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2025.2541206\">a “win” to lean in to known falsehoods</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ep1t9nsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We are</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4ogbeIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">social psychologists</a> who study political psychology and how people reason about reality. During the pandemic, we surveyed 5,535 people across eight countries to investigate why people believed COVID-19 misinformation, like false claims that 5G networks cause the virus.</p>\n\n<p>The strongest predictor of whether someone believed in COVID-19-related misinformation and risks related to the vaccine was whether they viewed COVID-19 prevention efforts in terms of symbolic strength and weakness. In other words, this group focused on whether an action would make them appear to fend off or “give in” to untoward influence.</p>\n\n<p>This factor outweighed how people felt about COVID-19 in general, their thinking style and even their political beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Our survey measured it on a scale of how much people agreed with sentences including “Following coronavirus prevention guidelines means you have backed down” and “Continuous coronavirus coverage in the media is a sign we are losing.” Our interpretation is that people who responded positively to these statements would feel they “win” by endorsing misinformation – doing so can show “the enemy” that it will not gain any ground over people’s views.</p>\n\n<h2>When meaning is symbolic, not factual</h2>\n\n<p>Rather than consider issues in light of actual facts, we suggest people with this mindset prioritize being independent from outside influence. It means you can justify espousing pretty much anything – the easier a statement is to disprove, the more of a power move it is to say it, as it symbolizes how far you’re willing to go.</p>\n\n<p>When people think symbolically this way, the literal issue – here, fighting COVID-19 – is secondary to a psychological war over people’s minds. In the minds of those who think they’re engaged in them, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5871/bacad/9780197267493.001.0001\">psychological wars</a> are waged over opinions and attitudes, and are won via control of belief and messaging. The U.S. government at various times has used the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14650045.2017.1342623\">concept of psychological war</a> to try to limit the influence of foreign powers, pushing people to think that literal battles are less important than psychological independence.</p>\n\n<p>By that same token, vaccination, masking or other COVID-19 prevention efforts could be seen as a symbolic risk that could “weaken” one psychologically even if they provide literal physical benefits. If this seems like an extreme stance, it is – the majority of participants in our studies did not hold this mindset. But those who did were especially likely to also believe in misinformation.</p>\n\n<p>In an additional study we ran that focused on attitudes around cryptocurrency, we measured whether people saw crypto investment in terms of signaling independence from traditional finance. These participants, who, like those in our COVID-19 study, prioritized a symbolic show of strength, were more likely to believe in other kinds of misinformation and conspiracies, too, such as that the government is concealing evidence of alien contact.</p>\n\n<p>In all of our studies, this mindset was also strongly associated with authoritarian attitudes, including beliefs that some groups should dominate others and support for autocratic government.

The correct information is easily available, but is irrelevant to someone who prioritizes a symbolic show of strength. What matters is signaling one isn’t listening and won’t be swayed.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, for symbolic thinkers, nearly any statement should be justifiable. The more outlandish or easily disproved something is, the more powerful one might seem when standing by it. Being an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edgelord\">edgelord</a> – a contrarian online provocateur – or outright lying can, in their own odd way, appear “authentic.”</p>\n\n<p>Some people may also view their favorite dissembler’s claims as provocative trolling, but, given the link between this mindset and authoritarianism, they want those far-fetched claims acted on anyway. The deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, for example, can be the desired end goal, even if the offered justification is a transparent farce.</p>\n\n<h2>Is this really 5-D chess?</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible that symbolic, but not exactly true, beliefs have some downstream benefit, such as serving as negotiation tactics, loyalty tests, or a fake-it-till-you-make-it long game that somehow, eventually, becomes a reality. Political theorist Murray Edelman, known for his work on <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo5948882.html\">political symbolism</a>, noted that politicians often prefer scoring symbolic points over delivering results – it’s easier. Leaders can offer symbolism when they have little tangible to provide.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265652/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Its availability and price directly affect <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47617\">housing costs and broader economic activity in the building sector</a>. The U.S. imports about <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FO\">40% of the softwood lumber the nation uses each year</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx?publish=1\">more than 80% of that from Canada</a>.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump says that the U.S. has the capacity to meet <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">95% of softwood lumber demand</a> and directed federal officials to update policies and regulatory guidelines to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/\">expand domestic timber harvesting</a> and curb the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">arrival of foreign lumber</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/adjusting-imports-of-timber-lumber-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/\">On Sept. 29, 2025</a>, he announced new tariffs on imported timber and wood products, including an additional 10% tariff on Canadian lumber. Those were added to <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-countervailing\">35% tariffs imposed on Canadian lumber</a> in August. It was the latest phase in a long-standing dispute over the supply of lumber to builders in the U.S., which dates back to the 1980s, when U.S. producers began arguing that Canadian companies were benefiting from unfair subsidies from their government. Starting on Oct. 15, Canadian softwood lumber imports could face <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/blog/2025/09/section-232-tariffs\">tariffs exceeding 45%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As researchers studying the <a href=\"https://utia.tennessee.edu/publications/wp-content/uploads/sites/269/2023/10/W1064.pdf\">forestry sector</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102350\">international trade</a>, we recognize that the U.S. has ample forest resources. But replacing imports with domestic lumber isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p>\n\n<p>There are differences in tree species and quality, and U.S. lumber often comes at a higher cost, even with tariffs on imports. Challenges like limited labor and manufacturing capacity require long-term investments, which temporary tariffs and uncertain trade policies often fail to encourage. In addition, the amount of lumber imported tends to mirror the boom-and-bust cycles of housing construction, a dynamic that tariffs alone are unlikely to change.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"no5Xp\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/no5Xp/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Trump’s moves</h2>\n\n<p>To boost U.S. logging, in March, Trump issued an executive order telling the departments of Interior and Agriculture to ease what he called “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/\">heavy-handed</a>” regulations on timber harvesting. The executive order and a <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/04/04/secretary-rollins-announces-sweeping-reforms-protect-national-forests-and-boost-domestic-timber\">follow-up memo from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins</a> do not spell out specifics, but officials say more details are in the works that will simplify the timber harvesting process, with the goal of boosting <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/04/04/secretary-rollins-announces-sweeping-reforms-protect-national-forests-and-boost-domestic-timber\">domestic timber production by 25%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That same month, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to assess how imports of timber, lumber and related wood products affect <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-timber-lumber/\">U.S. national security</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While that assessment was underway, in July, the Commerce Department published findings from a <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-antidumping-duty\">trade review of 2023 Canadian lumber imports</a>. That inquiry alleged that Canadian companies were selling lumber to the U.S. at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/press-release/commerce-department-announces-final-results-softwood-lumber-canada-antidumping-duty\">unfairly low prices</a>, potentially leaving U.S. producers with lower sales or depressed prices. That finding was cited as the basis for the 35% August tariff announcement.</p>\n\n<p>In its national security investigation initiated in March, the Commerce Department concluded that an overreliance on imported wood products means “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/adjusting-imports-of-timber-lumber-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/\">the United States may be unable to meet demands</a> for wood products that are crucial to the national defense and critical infrastructure.” The September tariff announcement is based on those findings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Large piles of cut logs are stacked, with homes visible in the distance.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695243/original/file-20251008-56-ptwg4q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Canadian timber harvesting continues, despite uncertainty about trade with the U.S.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/wood-boards-are-seen-ready-for-shipment-at-the-c-a-spencer-news-photo/2208902064\">Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Canadian lumber in the US market</h2>\n\n<p>In 1991, the <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/\">U.S. imported 11.5 billion board feet</a> (27 million cubic meters) of Canadian lumber. Those imports rose to a high of 22 billion board feet (52 million cubic meters) by 2005.</p>\n\n<p>But as housing construction declined – especially during the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath\">Great Recession</a> from 2007 to 2009 – imports dropped sharply, to less than 8.4 billion board feet (20 million cubic meters) in 2009. The current volume has not recovered to prerecession levels, rising only to 12 billion board feet (28 million cubic meters) in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The value of Canadian lumber has also fluctuated. Historically, prices for Canadian lumber have <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/\">averaged about US$330 per thousand board feet</a> ($140 per cubic meter). During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46636\">import prices soared</a> to almost $800 per thousand board feet ($340 per cubic meter). But since peaking in 2021 and 2022, prices have dropped significantly to $436 per thousand board feet ($185 per cubic meter) by 2024.</p>\n\n<p>In total, in 2024, the U.S. imported <a href=\"https://dataweb.usitc.gov/trade/search/GenImp/HTS\">more than $11 billion in forest and wood products</a> from Canada. Softwood lumber accounted for almost half of that.</p>\n\n<h2>Lumber and housing</h2>\n\n<p>As personal income rises and populations grow, people seek to build new homes. As new home construction – called “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housingstarts.asp\">housing starts</a>” in economic data – increases, so does demand for softwood lumber to build those homes. And when housing starts slow, so does lumber demand.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, housing starts fell during the Great Recession. They declined from a January 2006 peak of 2.3 million to less than 500,000 in January 2009 – <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST\">a decrease of nearly 80%</a>. In that same period, imports of Canadian lumber <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx?publish=1\">fell by more than 60%</a>. Domestic softwood lumber production <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/F\">fell by more than 40%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Both domestic and imported lumber prices can directly influence the overall cost of building homes, which in turn <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/business/tariffs-lumber-furniture-housing-crisis.html\">affects housing affordability</a>. That said, lumber used for framing usually accounts for <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47617\">less than 10% of the total cost to build a new home</a>. The effects of tariffs on new home construction may be significantly less than other factors, such as <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/prices-home-remodeling-outpaced-inflation-quarter-due-labor-126072222\">rising labor costs</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cvpw_PxKsM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=27\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">There are different kinds of wood commonly used in building lumber.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A matter of choice</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. has a lot of potential lumber available. Especially in the South, the <a href=\"https://mff.forest.mtu.edu/TreeBasics/USFSfacts&amp;trends2014.pdf#page=23\">inventory of harvestable lumber has grown significantly</a> over many years.</p>\n\n<p>However, the types of wood available in the U.S. are not always the same as what’s available from Canadian imports. For framing, contractors may prefer spruce, northern pines and fir, naturally abundant in Canada, because they are <a href=\"https://ls-usa.com/blog/terminology/what-is-lumber-grading\">lighter and less likely to warp</a> than southern yellow pine, which is abundant in the southern U.S. Southern yellow pine is more commonly used to make utility poles and preservative-treated lumber for outdoor construction projects, such as decks.</p>\n\n<p>Lumber from Idaho, eastern Oregon and eastern Washington, however, does share characteristics with Canadian species and could take the place of at least some Canadian lumber.</p>\n\n<p>As the Trump administration seeks to boost domestic lumber, buyers will be looking not only at where their lumber came from, but what it costs and what type of lumber is best for what they need to accomplish.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265713/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andrew Muhammad received funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research timber demand in Vietnam.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adam Taylor does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The technology promises to make police reports more accurate and comprehensive, as well as save officers time.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.axon.com/products/draft-one\">idea is simple</a>: Take the audio transcript from a body camera worn by a police officer and use the predictive text capabilities of large language models to write a formal police report that could become the basis of a criminal prosecution. Mirroring other fields that have allowed ChatGPT-like systems to write on behalf of people, police can now get an AI assist to automate much dreaded paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The catch is that instead of writing the first draft of your college English paper, this document can determine someone’s liberty in court. An <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/internal-memo-dont-use-ai-for-police-reports-prosecutor-tells-seattle-area-law-enforcement/\">error, omission or hallucination</a> can risk the integrity of a prosecution or, worse, justify a false arrest. While police officers must sign off on the final version, the bulk of the text, structure and formatting is AI-generated. </p>\n\n<h2>Who – or what – wrote it</h2>\n\n<p>Up until October 2025, only <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/%7E2025/bills/static/SB0180.html\">Utah</a> had required that police even admit they were using an AI assistant to draft their reports. On Oct. 10, that changed when California became the second state to require transparent notice that AI was used to draft a police report. </p>\n\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB524\">SB 524 into law</a>, requiring all AI-assisted police reports to be marked as being written with the help of AI. The law also requires law enforcement agencies to maintain an audit trail that identifies the person who used AI to create a report and any video and audio footage used in creating the report. It also requires agencies to retain the first draft created with AI for as long as the official report is retained, and prohibits a draft created with AI from constituting an officer’s official statement.</p>\n\n<p>The law is a significant milestone in the regulation of AI in policing, but its passage also signifies that AI is going to become a major part of the criminal justice system. </p>\n\n<p>If you are sitting behind bars based on a police report, you might have some questions. The first question that Utah and California now answer is “Did AI write this?” Basic transparency that an algorithm helped write an arrest report might seem the minimum a state could do before locking someone up. And, even though leading police technology companies like <a href=\"https://investor.axon.com/2024-04-23-Axon-reimagines-report-writing-with-Draft-One,-a-first-of-its-kind-AI-powered-force-multiplier-for-public-safety\">Axon</a> <a href=\"https://my.axon.com/s/article/Draft-One-Settings?language=en_US\">recommend such disclaimers</a> be included in their reports, they are not required. </p>\n\n<p>Police departments in Lafayette, Indiana and Fort Collins, Colorado, were intentionally <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2025/08/axon-police-ai-draft-one-foia/\">turning off the transparency defaults</a> on the AI report generators, according to an investigative news report. Similarly, police chiefs using Axon’s Draft One products <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/04/axon-ai-police-reports-00177331\">did not even know</a> which reports were drafted by AI and which were not because the officers were just cutting and pasting the AI narrative into reports they indicated they wrote themselves. The practice <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency\">bypassed all AI disclaimers and audit trails</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQ2oS87PxeA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The author explains the issues around AI-written police reports in an interview on CNN’s ‘Terms of Service’ podcast.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Many questions</h2>\n\n<p>Transparency is only the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/effs-guide-getting-records-about-axons-ai-generated-police-reports\">first step</a>. Understanding <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4897632\">the risks</a> of relying on AI for police reports is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2oS87PxeA\">the second</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Technological questions arise about how the AI models were trained and the possible biases baked into a reliance on past police reports. Transcription questions arise about errors, omissions and mistranslations because police stops take place in chaotic, loud and frequently emotional contexts amid a host of languages. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, trial questions arise about how an attorney is supposed to cross-examine an AI-generated document, or whether the audit logs need to be retained for expert analysis or turned over to the defense.</p>\n\n<h2>Risks and consequences</h2>\n\n<p>The significance of the California law is not simply that the public needs to be aware of AI risks, but that California is embracing AI risk in policing. I believe it’s likely that people will lose their liberty based on a document that was largely generated by AI and without the hard questions satisfactorily answered.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, in a criminal justice system that relies on plea bargaining for <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/10-209\">more than 95%</a> of cases and is overwhelmingly dominated by misdemeanor offenses, there may never be a chance to check whether the AI report accurately captured the scene. In fact, in many of those lower-level cases, the police report will be the basis of charging decisions, pretrial detention, motions, plea bargains, sentencing and even probation revocations.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that a criminal legal system that relies so heavily on police reports has a responsibility to ensure that police departments are embracing not just transparency but justice. At a minimum, this means more states following Utah and California to pass laws regulating the technology, and police departments following the best practices recommended by the technology companies. </p>\n\n<p>But even that may not be enough without <a href=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract=4897632\">critical assessments</a> by courts, legal experts and defense lawyers. The future of AI policing is just starting, but the risks are already here.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267410/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andrew Guthrie Ferguson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Over the past few years, this technology has seen significant growth and use in the clinic. And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease.</p>\n\n<h2>A brief history of focused ultrasound</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound\">Ultrasound is generated</a> with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues.</p>\n\n<p>Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.26.2.179\">heat up and destroy</a> brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf. Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain and even cancer.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Frontal brain MRI\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=905&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">MRI of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MRI-guided_HIFU,_essential_tremor,_10-14_135,_pointed.png\">Jmarchn/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet, despite these early findings, technical hurdles stood in the way of applying focused ultrasound in the clinic. For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult. Researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/17/r206\">eventually overcame this problem</a> by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets.</p>\n\n<p>It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. <a href=\"https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/indication-development-pipeline/\">Hundreds of clinical trials</a> aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing. Researchers have found notable success on a condition called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1600159\">essential tremor</a>, which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now <a href=\"https://www.fusfoundation.org/diseases-and-conditions/essential-tremor/\">performed routinely at many locations</a> around the world. </p>\n\n<p>I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system.</p>\n\n<h2>Delivering drugs to the brain</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier-and-how-can-we-overcome-it-75454\">blood-brain barrier</a> is evolution’s exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels. It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target. </p>\n\n<p>More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2202001804\">temporarily open the blood-brain barrier</a> by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate. This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6Sx9y8eytk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment. Clinical trials testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061230\">glioblastoma</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4011\">brain metastases</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2022.114583\">Alzheimer’s disease</a> are underway.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/boyer-lectures-gene-therapy-is-still-in-its-infancy-but-the-future-looks-promising-104558\">Gene therapy</a> involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease. Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>\n\n<p>Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay1344\">facilitate the delivery of gene therapies</a> to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people.</p>\n\n<h2>Stimulating immune responses against cancer</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/anti-cancer-car-t-therapy-reengineers-t-cells-to-kill-tumors-and-researchers-are-expanding-the-limited-types-of-cancer-it-can-target-196471\">Cancer immunotherapy</a> instructs the patient’s own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma – have tumors that are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01979-x\">immunologically “cold,”</a> meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92089\">better recognize and destroy cancer cells</a>. One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world’s first <a href=\"https://med.virginia.edu/uva-focused-ultrasound-cancer-immunotherapy-center/\">focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center</a> in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic. For example, my colleagues are <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472661\">running a clinical trial</a> at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-cancer-cells-can-become-immortal-research-finds-a-mutated-gene-that-helps-melanoma-defeat-the-normal-limits-on-repeated-replication-194234\">advanced melanoma</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound</h2>\n\n<p>Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases.</p>\n\n<p>One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/SVIN.123.001140\">cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM</a>. CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0439\">debilitating neurological symptoms</a>. The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects.</p>\n\n<p>We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113861\">improve drug delivery to CCMs</a>. Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01390-z\">stop CCMs from growing</a> in mice, even without administering a drug. While we don’t yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/25424823251343789\">abundant research on the safety</a> of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM.</p>\n\n<p>With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262622/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richard J.

We study what happens when we put different types of materials in the X-ray free-electron pulses’ path. In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09105-9\">new experiment</a> we put copper and manganese samples in the path of highly focused X-ray free-electron laser pulses.

At first, we did not understand why, but when we eventually figured it out, we realized that we had discovered two unique laser phenomena, and that these effects had helped us generate X-ray laser pulses that where much shorter than we’d expected – shorter than the fastest X-ray pulses ever previously generated. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgaG7f96SKM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The short pulses generated by the laser at SLAC allow researchers to study molecules at the atomic scale or see how different materials interact with X-ray light.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Filamentation – irregular spurts</h2>\n\n<p>We found that our new X-ray laser pulses weren’t always shooting out in the forward direction, as we expected. When we increased the intensity of the X-ray free-electron laser pulses, the resulting new X-ray laser pulses spurted out irregularly, in slightly different directions. </p>\n\n<p>For optical lasers, these irregular spurts – or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filament_propagation\">filamentation</a> – <a href=\"https://www.unige.ch/gap/nonlinear/research/filamentation\">result from</a> the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/refractive-index\">index of refraction</a> changing in the laser material. But we didn’t expect to see this effect for X-rays, since materials – including the manganese and copper we used – don’t refract X-rays very much. </p>\n\n<p>However, the high intensity X-ray free-electron laser pulses we used generated the fluctuations <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics\">at the quantum level</a> in our materials that led to these irregular spurts.</p>\n\n<h2>Rabi cycling – a broad spectrum of light</h2>\n\n<p>Even more surprising than the filamentation effects we saw was the fact that the X-ray pulses we generated contained a variety of different wavelengths that were more spread out than what we expected to see with the materials we used. </p>\n\n<p>Seventy years ago – five years before the first optical laser was built – physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.100.703\">discovered a strange phenomenon</a> in microwaves known as Rabi cycling. And the spread of wavelengths we saw looked just like Rabi cycling.</p>\n\n<p>Autler and Townes knew that when light hit an atom, the atom would absorb its energy by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/excitation\">exciting an electron</a> from one energy level to a higher one.

The Conversation spoke with Gaffield about the challenges of presenting the Haitian leader to a modern readership.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What drove you to write the book now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although there have been biographies of Dessalines in Haiti and a heavily fictionalized one in France in 1804, until now there hasn’t been one published in the English language.</p>\n\n<p>And this silence forms part of a much longer process of demonizing Dessalines in the international sphere – he just doesn’t get the same attention that <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/303774/black-spartacus-by-hazareesingh-sudhir/9780141985060\">Toussaint Louverture</a> gets in the narrative of the Haitian Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>What I found interesting was the Desssalines that emerged in my research didn’t match the Dessalines that was being presented in public. I was interested in his international diplomacy and state-making, but many accounts just highlighted the violence of the revolution and Dessalines’ very radical role.</p>\n\n<p>On one side, he is criticized for being uniquely violent – something that wasn’t even true in the context of the time. But characterizing him this way was an attempt to present him as “savage,” “barbaric” and in line with other racist tropes. On the other hand, he is celebrated by Haitians and others for his use of violence. He was seen as the man for the job – the job of ending more than a century of French colonial rule.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left \">\n            <img alt=\"An engraving shows a crude depiction of a man holding a sword holding a severed head.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696281/original/file-20251014-64-o28dp8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1091&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A crude depiction of Jean-Jacques Dessalines holding the severed head of a white colonist woman used to illustrate Louis Dubroca’s fictionalized biography.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:General_Jean-Jacques_Dessalines_holding_a_mutiliated_white_woman%27s_head.046.jpg\">Manuel López López/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But in the book, I tell a more complicated story of Dessalines. Yes, he was a military leader who fought on the front lines, and success came from violent warfare. But he was a multilayered person; his state-building wasn’t just about violent revolution but also diplomacy and international relations and a deep commitment to abolitionism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why has Dessalines been singled out for committing violence?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A number of different things are at play here. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, the French people reporting on the ground and from abroad held Dessalines and other Haitian revolutionaries to a different standard. While the white French colonists perpetrated acts of extreme brutality and violence, when Haitian revolutionaries fought back, they were criticized for not following the standard rules of warfare.</p>\n\n<p>This was a double standard that all Haitian revolutionaries were held to – but Dessalines was singled out. The Haitian Revolution began in 1791, and the revolutionaries forced France to abolish slavery in 1793. After that time, Dessalines joined France to defend this hard-won freedom. And this is one of the parts of Dessalines’ life that doesn’t often get remembered or talked about – for much of the Haitian Revolution he was a French general, defending the abolition of slavery against attacks from other European empires. But when the French themselves started to undo abolition, Dessalines understood that freedom could be preserved only with independence.</p>\n\n<p>Dessalines’ reputation took on another layer in the war for independence and after. He ended up becoming an enemy of the French state, and criticism of Dessalines’ violence helped the French undermine the fight for Haitian independence, especially internationally.</p>\n\n<p>After he <a href=\"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/haitian-independence/\">declared independence on Jan. 1, 1804</a>, Dessalines executed some of the French colonists who remained on the island. This was legitimized as a way to protect the country from further invasions – which the French were constantly threatening to do. It was also vengeance for the crimes committed by the French colonists during the colonial era and during the horrific expedition sent by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.</p>\n\n<p>The 1804 killings of French people did a lot to forge Dessalines’ image overseas. A lot of the narratives in the early months of 1804 were created from reports written by French and British people who were scared of Haitian independence and scared of the abolition of slavery.</p>\n\n<p>Actual evidence of what happened is limited. But certainly not every white person was killed as is often stated. British and American merchants were safe, Polish people in Haiti were welcomed into the new nation, and even the reports of the number of French people killed undermine each other. Some white French people were even given Haitian citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>But people at the time were not interested in making a nuanced argument or interested in understanding the Haitian perspective, and so they made sweeping claims about every last white person being “massacred.”</p>\n\n<p>These claims were part of a broader effort to demonize Haitians and ensure that independence failed.</p>\n\n<p>And in some ways the emphasis on Dessalines’ violence is odd. It overlooks the violence of slavery and the French colonial rule. The actions of the French in denying their defeat in Haiti were certainly much more significant to Haiti’s long-term future than anything Dessalines did or didn’t do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has the view of Dessalines changed since his lifetime?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Haiti there have been ebbs and flows in how he has been remembered, especially in the 19th century. Part of this is because people there were living in a world in which Haitian sovereignty was not recognized by other counties. While it gained independence under Dessalines in 1804, the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/haitian-rev\">U.S. didn’t recognize it until 1862</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And there were moments when people tied Dessalines’ violent reputation to this foreign nonrecognition. But it was not the only reason that countries did not extend relations to Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t really until the 100th anniversary of independence, in 1904, when Dessalines finally got established in the pantheon of Haitian founding fathers. And it was from then that his memory was more firmly remembered as positive. The national anthem composed to celebrate the centenary is “<a href=\"https://www.classical-music.com/articles/la-dessalinienne-lyrics-haiti-national-anthem-words\">La Dessalinienne</a>,” named in his honor, for example. </p>\n\n<p>In Haitian politics today, he tends to stand in for national sovereignty and the rejection of external influence. That Haiti should exist with no outside meddling is his political reputation nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of Haiti, it is only much more recently that Dessalines’ actions have been seen in a more nuanced way.</p>\n\n<p>But even now there is no consensus over his reputation. There are remnants of his portrayals from more than 200 years ago. Tucker Carlson in 2018 referred to Dessalines as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1912111005760373\">a “genocidal nutcase</a>.” He was talking about the Haitian emperor in the context of a street in an area known as “Little Haiti” in Brooklyn, New York, being renamed in his honor. </p>\n\n<p>But the renaming of the street also plays into the rehabilitation of Dessalines. His image has also been used in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrZYIUPyZyU\">Beats by Dre commercial featuring the tennis player Naomi Osaka</a>. It also was used in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3464896/\">Steve McQueen’s “Small Axe</a>” films.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrZYIUPyZyU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk us through your choice of cover image?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first thing to note is that none of the images we have of Dessalines were done by anyone who ever saw him – so they just made it up. That started with the very racist depiction of him in a Spanish translation of the <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/La-vie-de-J.J.-Dessalines-:-chef-des-noirs-revoltes-de-Saint-Domingue-avec-des-notes-tres-detaillees-sur-l'origine-le-caractere-la-vie-et-les-atrocites-des-principaux-chefs-des-noirs-depuis-l'insurrection-de-1791/oclc/5231703\">1804 biography “La Vie de J-J Dessalines</a>” by Louis Dubroca, which included a person meant to be Dessalines holding a decapitated white woman’s head. That image circulated and stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar racist depictions were released, all meant to support an argument that Dessalines was born in Africa – which he wasn’t – and was very “African”-like, by which they meant “savage.”</p>\n\n<p>The painting I used for the cover is by Haitian artist Ulrick Jean-Pierre. It shows Dessalines standing boldly and confidently. I also like the fact that the feathers on the cap and trees behind him are swaying: He is standing boldly but in a stormy, unsettled and complicated era.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was researching the book tricky, given the bias of many sources?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the records on the Haitian revolution were written by people who opposed the revolutionaries. But there is not nothing from the other side – there are accounts of these events written by Haitians, and there are letters and declarations by Dessalines himself. These, in my opinion, haven’t been taken as seriously as they could have because so many people were trying to undermine Dessalines’ political project. Throughout the book I take Dessalines’ words seriously, and those of his fellow Haitian revolutionaries.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I encountered when I started this research was a lot of people saying, “There’s not a lot of sources for that.” One strategy I employed was looking for sources everywhere and anywhere. You can find sources on the revolution in Haiti but also in the U.S., France, the Netherlands, England, the Vatican and in Jamaica – anyplace that had interactions with Haiti. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you learn during the writing of the book?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I got a better sense of how personal the Haitian Revolution was to Dessalines. I had initially studied Dessalines through the lens of international diplomacy. So I saw him as a head of state, rather than an individual.</p>\n\n<p>Through the research, I got a much better sense of the experiences that drove the man and his fight for freedom and against colonization – through his experiences with his extended family and his interactions with colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>At the cost of personal relations and personal safety, he fought for freedom – and that was the driving force behind everything for Dessalines: the fight to abolish slavery.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266326/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julia Gaffield received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. </span></em></p>",

At the same time, health care providers, teachers and school systems have reported <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119427\">an uptick in requests for ADHD assessments</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These reports have led some experts and parents to wonder <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd-overdiagnosed\">whether ADHD is being overdiagnosed and overtreated</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As researchers who have <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PtJmhRwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">spent our careers studying neurodevelopmental disorders</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GuqlxnAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">like ADHD</a>, we are concerned that fears about widespread overdiagnosis are misplaced, perhaps based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the condition.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding ADHD as one end of a spectrum</h2>\n\n<p>Discussions about overdiagnosis of ADHD imply that you either have it or you don’t. </p>\n\n<p>However, when epidemiologists ask people in the general population about their symptoms of ADHD, some have a few symptoms, some have a moderate level, and a few have lots of symptoms. But there is no clear dividing line between those who are diagnosed with ADHD and those who are not, since ADHD – much like blood pressure – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547231222228\">occurs on a spectrum</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Treating mild ADHD is similar to treating mild high blood pressure – it depends on the situation. Care can be helpful when a doctor considers the details of a person’s daily life and how much the symptoms are affecting them.</p>\n\n<p>Not only can ADHD symptoms be very different from person to person, but research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12475\">ADHD symptoms can change within an individual</a>. For example, symptoms become more severe when the challenges of life increase. </p>\n\n<p>ADHD symptoms <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21010032\">fluctuate depending on many factors</a>, including whether the person is at school or home, whether they have had enough sleep, if they are under a great deal of stress or if they are taking medications or other substances. Someone who has mild ADHD may not experience many symptoms while they are on vacation and well rested, for example, but they may have impairing symptoms if they have a demanding job or school schedule and have not gotten enough sleep. These people may need treatment for ADHD in certain situations but may do just fine without treatment in other situations.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to what is seen in conditions like high blood pressure, which can change from day to day or from month to month, depending on a person’s diet, stress level and many other factors.</p>\n\n<h2>Can ADHD symptoms change over time?</h2>\n\n<p>ADHD symptoms start in early childhood and typically are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-017-0853-z\">at their worst in mid-to late childhood</a>. Thus, the average age of diagnosis is between 9 and 12 years old. This age is also the time when children are transitioning from elementary school to middle school and may also be experiencing changes in their environment that make their symptoms worse. </p>\n\n<p>Classes can be more challenging beginning around fifth grade than in earlier grades. In addition, the transition to middle school typically means that children move from having all their subjects taught by one teacher in a single classroom to having to change classrooms with a different teacher for each class. These changes can exacerbate symptoms that were previously well-controlled.</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms can also wax and wane throughout life. For most people, symptoms improve – but may not completely disappear – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/ms9.0000000000000631\">after age 25</a>, which is also the time when the brain has typically finished developing. </p>\n\n<p>Psychiatric problems that often co-occur with ADHD, such as anxiety or depression, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1597559\">can worsen ADHD symptoms that are already present</a>. These conditions can also mimic ADHD symptoms, making it difficult to know which to treat. High levels of stress leading to poorer sleep, and increased demands at work or school, can also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536207\">exacerbate or cause ADHD-like symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the use of some substances, such as marijuana or sedatives, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2019.1634086\">can worsen, or even cause, ADHD symptoms</a>. In addition to making symptoms worse in someone who already has an ADHD diagnosis, these factors can also push someone who has mild symptoms into full-blown ADHD, at least for a short time. </p>\n\n<p>The reverse is also true: Symptoms of ADHD can be minimized or reversed in people who do not meet full diagnostic criteria once the external cause is removed. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_If_MX8h8I?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Kids with ADHD often have overlapping symptoms with anxiety, depression, dyslexia and more.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How prevalence is determined</h2>\n\n<p>Clinicians diagnose ADHD based on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. To make an ADHD diagnosis in children, six or more symptoms in <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\">at least one of these three categories</a> must be present. For adults, five or more symptoms are required, but they must begin in childhood. For all ages, the symptoms must cause serious problems in at least two areas of life, such as home, school or work. </p>\n\n<p>Current estimates show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyt261\">the strict prevalence of ADHD</a> is about 5% in children. In young adults, the figure drops to 3%, and it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04009\">less than 1% after age 60</a>. Researchers use the term “strict prevalence” to mean the percentage of people who meet all of the criteria for ADHD based on epidemiological studies. It is an important number because it provides clinicians and scientists with an estimate on how many people are expected to have ADHD in a given group of people. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the “diagnosed prevalence” is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with ADHD based on real-world assessments by health care professionals. The diagnosed prevalence in the U.S. and Canada ranges <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119427\">from 7.5% to 11.1%</a> in children under age 18. These rates are quite a bit higher than the strict prevalence of 5%.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers claim that the difference between the diagnosed prevalence and the strict prevalence <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">means that ADHD is overdiagnosed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We disagree. In clinical practice, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425787\">the diagnostic rules</a> allow a patient to be diagnosed with ADHD if they have most of the symptoms that cause distress, impairment or both, even when they don’t meet the full criteria. And much evidence shows that increases in the diagnostic prevalence can be attributed to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">diagnosing milder cases</a> that may have been missed previously. The validity of these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2019.02.003\">mild diagnoses is well-documented</a>.    </p>\n\n<p>Consider children who have five inattentive symptoms and five hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. These children would not meet strict diagnostic criteria for ADHD even though they clearly have a lot of ADHD symptoms. But in clinical practice, these children would be diagnosed with ADHD if they had marked distress, disability or both because of their symptoms – in other words, if the symptoms were interfering substantially with their everyday lives. </p>\n\n<p>So it makes sense that the diagnosed prevalence of ADHD is substantially higher than the strict prevalence.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Middle-aged woman sitting at a table and giving a pill to an adolescent girl, who is sipping a glass of water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695992/original/file-20251013-56-5e1pwk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A robust body of literature shows the negative outcomes associated with underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/medication-time-royalty-free-image/2148402028?phrase=ADHD&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">SolStock/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Implications for patients, parents and clinicians</h2>\n\n<p>People who are concerned about overdiagnosis commonly worry that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/magazine/adhd-medication-treatment-research.html\">people are taking medications</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">they don’t need</a> or that they are diverting resources away from those who need it more. Other concerns are that people may experience side effects from the medications, or that they may be stigmatized by a diagnosis. </p>\n\n<p>Those concerns are important. However, there is strong evidence that underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.01.022\">lead to serious negative outcomes</a> in school, work, mental health and quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the risks of not treating ADHD are well-established. In contrast, the potential harms of overdiagnosis <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5335\">remain largely unproven</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to consider how to manage the growing number of milder cases, however. Research suggests that children and adults with less severe ADHD symptoms may benefit less from medication than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.1281\">those with more severe symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This raises an important question: How much benefit is enough to justify treatment? These are decisions best made in conversations between clinicians, patients and caregivers.</p>\n\n<p>Because ADHD symptoms can shift with age, stress, environment and other life circumstances, treatment needs to be flexible. For some, simple adjustments like classroom seating changes, better sleep or reduced stress may be enough. For others, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/adhd-brains-present-unique-challenges-but-the-condition-is-highly-treatable-a-primary-care-nurse-practitioner-with-adhd-explains-the-science-230062\">medication, behavior therapy or a combination of these interventions</a> may be necessary. The key is a personalized approach that adapts as patients’ needs evolve over time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257108/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carol Mathews receives funding from the National Institutes of Health and the International OCD Foundation.

Unfortunately, a few days after Peaches was <a href=\"https://www.islander.org/2023/09/will-flamingos-call-this-gulf-coast-home/\">released back into the wilds of Tampa Bay</a>, the tracking device failed. His last reported sighting was on a beach near Marco Island on Oct. 5, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in June 2025, I received an email from colleagues at the Rio Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatan, Mexico, who <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2025/06/11/peaches-idalia-flamingo-spotted-in-yucatan\">had photographed Peaches, blue band still in place</a>, nesting in the reserve.</p>\n\n<p>Peaches’ story is the latest piece in the historical puzzle of flamingos in Florida. Though the native population disappeared more than 100 years ago, recent events lead me to believe that flamingos may be coming back to the Sunshine State, and that their return has been facilitated by the concerted effort to restore the Everglades and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n\n<h2>Decimation of a population</h2>\n\n<p>In 1956, ornithologist and founder of the <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/florida/projects/everglades-science-center\">National Audubon’s Everglades Science Center</a> <a href=\"https://www.rpanaturalarea.org/robert-porter-allen\">Robert Porter Allen</a> wrote “<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article-abstract/75/2/228/5223157\">The Flamingos: Their Life History and Survival</a>,” which is still considered a seminal document on the history of flamingos in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>In his book, Allen cites several historical and scientific manuscripts from the 1800s that indicate flamboyances of hundreds to thousands were seen in the Everglades, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.</p>\n\n<p>Allen documents the demise of flamingos in the late 1800s, in Florida and throughout their Caribbean and Bahamian range. Like all wading birds in Florida, they fell victim to the women’s fashion trend of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wgs49RgFN8\">adorning hats with bird feathers</a>. Wading bird feathers were literally worth their weight in gold.</p>\n\n<p>Led by the National Association of Audubon Societies’ vocal opposition, the grassroots environmental movement that followed brought about laws prohibiting the hunting and sale of bird feathers. But enforcement of those laws in sparsely populated Florida was difficult, and on two occasions <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813034423\">deputized Audubon wardens were murdered</a> protecting wading bird nesting colonies.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, within a few years, societal pressure turned the tide against the practice of wearing feathers. The passage of the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/law/migratory-bird-treaty-act-1918\">Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918</a> officially ended the feather trade.</p>\n\n<p>Given legal protection, most species managed to reestablish huge nesting populations in the Everglades by the 1930s-1940s, presumably migrating from remote populations in Central America and the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos, however, did not.</p>\n\n<h2>A long road to recovery</h2>\n\n<p>In 1956, 40 years after hunting had ended, Allen estimated flamingo populations were only about 25% of what they had been in the previous century, with numbers plummeting from 168,000 to 43,000 breeding adults. They nested in significant numbers at only four locations, compared to 29 historically.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos’ unique breeding behaviors and their longevity – they can live up to 50 years in the wild – may account for their struggle to bounce back. Other Florida wading birds can nest multiple times a year at different locations, laying three to five eggs at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Flamingos, on the other hand, nest only once a year, generally returning to the same location year after year, and lay only one egg. Furthermore, they prefer forming huge nesting colonies, with thousands of nests, in part due to their elaborate group courtship rituals.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason to hope</h2>\n\n<p>As a result of their rarity from the 1950s to 1980s, scientists – including myself – believed that any flamingos sighted intermittently around Florida were not wild birds but rather escapees from captive populations.</p>\n\n<p>The largest flock observed in the state between 1930 and 1976 was 14 birds spotted in Biscayne Bay in 1934, on the day after <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/century/2025-08-21/hialeah-flamingos-race-track-centennial-anniversary\">Hialeah Race Track in Miami imported a group of about 30 flamingos</a>. The track’s owners had failed to <a href=\"https://explore.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/grounded-the-pinioning-of-captive-birds\">pinion</a> the birds, and they simply flew away upon release.</p>\n\n<p>But my opinion began to change in 2002, when a flamingo that was banded as a chick at Rio Lagartos was photographed in Florida Bay. In 2012, <a href=\"https://brevardzoo.org/news/celebrating-the-inaugural-international-flamingo-day/\">a second bird</a> from Rio Lagartos was photographed.</p>\n\n<p>By that time, I had observed flamingos in Florida Bay on several occasions, including larger flamboyances of 24 and 64 individuals. Although I still thought the majority of these flocks were escapees, the banded birds provided some evidence that at least a few wild flamingos were starting to spend time in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2015, my colleagues put a <a href=\"https://www.zoomiami.org/florida-flamingo-program\">tracking device on a flamingo they had captured</a> at the Key West Naval Air Station. Conchy, as we called him, was given the blue band US01 and released in Florida Bay in December 2015.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.audubon.org/rsc_file/fl/ffn_492_page_58-81.pdf\">He lived in Florida Bay for two years</a>, and the fact that he stayed for that long was proof to me that it was possible for flamingos to make a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/590378419/floridas-long-lost-wild-flamingos-were-hiding-in-plain-sight\">more permanent home in Florida</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFYh-D3yvY0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Conchy was banded and given a GPS tracker by Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami before being re-released into Florida Bay in 2015.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In 2018, several colleagues and I published a paper laying out both evidence from historical accounts and also previously overlooked evidence from museums that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-187.1\">flamingos were native to Florida</a>. We also presented new data from researchers and citizen science portals that strongly indicated that wild flamingo numbers were increasing in Florida. This suggested that the population might be finally recovering.</p>\n\n<h2>Call it a comeback</h2>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and it appears that this slow comeback may finally have legs. Six months after Hurricane Idalia, my colleagues at Audubon Florida and I conducted a weeklong online survey of flamingo sightings in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>We received more than 50 reputable observations. After sorting through these observations to remove duplicates, we concluded that at least <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/florida/news/more-100-american-flamingos-counted-florida-during-february-census\">100 flamingos were left in the state</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then in July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/environment/2025-07-07/flamingos-florida-bay-everglades\">a flock of 125 individuals</a> was photographed in Florida Bay. Based on our observations, my colleagues and I believe that the flamingos that arrived with Idalia may be reestablishing a home in Florida.</p>\n\n<h2>Progress toward restoration</h2>\n\n<p>The question is, why now? The 24 flamingos I saw in 1992 and the 64 I saw in 2004 didn’t take up permanent residence in the state. So what’s changed?</p>\n\n<p>To me, the answer is clear: Efforts to restore the Everglades and Florida’s coastal ecosystems are beginning to show progress.</p>\n\n<p>When I arrived in the Keys in 1989, Florida Bay was <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/1603/#:%7E:text=Conservation%20issues%20presented%20to%20the,including%20the%20State%20of%20Florida\">undergoing an ecological collapse</a>. A 1993 interagency report by the federal government found that a hundred years of draining, diking and rerouting the flows of the Everglades to create urban and agricultural lands had <a href=\"https://scispace.com/pdf/deterioration-of-the-florida-bay-ecosystem-an-evaluation-of-4pot0gljt5.pdf\">raised the salt content</a> of the water, making it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0377-1\">uninhabitable for many estuarine animals</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The report noted that the bay’s famous seagrass beds were undergoing a massive die-off, accompanied by algal blooms that depleted oxygen levels, thereby killing fish in large numbers. Mangrove trees were dying on its myriad islands, and birds that for decades had nested in them had disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>These events kick-started Everglades restoration efforts, and in 2000 the U.S. Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/cerp.htm\">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> with nearly unanimous bipartisan support. With a cost in the tens of billions of dollars, it was to be the largest and most expensive ecological restoration project the world has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the bay’s health is vastly improved from the condition I observe in the 1980s. Water flow has gotten better, and the salinity is <a href=\"https://floridaspecifier.com/issues/v46n3/2024-environmental-report-highlights-everglades-restoration-progress/\">back to appropriate levels</a> to support wildlife.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 and 2021, <a href=\"https://media.audubon.org/rsc_file/fl/sfwbr_af_2021v10_0.pdf\">more than 100,000 pairs of wading birds</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/white-ibis\">white ibis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/wood-stork\">wood storks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/roseate-spoonbill\">roseate spoonbills</a> nested in the Everglades. These numbers hadn’t been seen since the 1940s. In the 1980s and 1990s, 20,000 nesting pairs was <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/SFWBR_2021_Final_3-13-23.pdf\">thought to be a banner year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the Everglades and Florida Bay are still a long way from full restoration, I believe that the return of flamingos such as Conchy and Peaches is evidence that these efforts are on the right track.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258658/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jerome Lorenz has received funding from The Lynn and Louis Wolfson II Family Foundation, the Batchelor Foundation and the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment.

A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in <a href=\"http://hurricanezone.org/tracking/pacific-w3.php\">forecasting its track</a> into the Bering Sea.</p>\n\n<p>But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways. </p>\n\n<p>The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A weather map with the storm's locations over time, headed toward Nome but then turning.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=516&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696168/original/file-20251014-56-7mw55u.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=648&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm track showing its turn toward Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Rick Thoman</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696173/original/file-20251014-56-vee6sw.jpeg\">final track and intensity weren’t clear</a> until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters.

Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea.</p>\n\n<p>Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong?</h2>\n\n<p>The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/2024-10-18/the-yk-deltas-permafrost-could-be-entirely-gone-within-decades\">Permafrost is also thawing</a>, land is subsiding, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58270-w\">sea-level rise</a> is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/2025-10-12/bethel-flooding-expected-to-recede-after-sunday-typhoon-remnant-impacts\">Even Bethel</a>, the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong.</p>\n\n<p>These are <a href=\"https://www.ykhc.org/story/about-yk/\">very remote communities</a> with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26186061-10132025-ykhc-response-to-typhoon-halong/\">a lot of people with nowhere to live</a>, and winter is closing in.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ll5P2Kw5riE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/public-safety/2024-08-18/bering-sea-storm-brings-erosion-and-flooding-to-western-alaska-communities\">major flooding in summer 2024</a>.

Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer?</p>\n\n<p>There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easy answer.</p>\n\n<p>It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"3NqmJ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3NqmJ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work.</p>\n\n<p>Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities.

He makes his displeasure clear in public speeches, interviews and congressional testimony. </p>\n\n<p>The network, afraid of the regulatory agency’s power to license their owned-and-operated stations, responds quickly. They change the content of their broadcasts. Network executives understand the FCC’s criticism is supported by the White House, and the chairman implicitly represents the president. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not just referring to the recent controversy between <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/27/brendan-carr-kimmel-fcc-00583301\">FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel</a>. The same chain of events has happened repeatedly in U.S. history.</p>\n\n<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s FCC chairman, James Lawrence Fly, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19376529.2025.2492552\">warned the networks about censoring news commentators</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was John F. Kennedy’s FCC chairman, <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/the-vast-wasteland-reconsidered/\">Newton Minow</a>, who <a href=\"https://time.com/4315217/newton-minow-vast-wasteland-1961-speech/\">criticized the networks</a> for not airing more news and public affairs programming to support American democracy during the Cold War. </p>\n\n<p>And there was George W. Bush’s FCC chairman, Michael Powell. He decided that a fleeting “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-jumps-into-bared-breast-flap/\">wardrobe malfunction</a>” during <a href=\"https://www.wrtv.com/lifestyle/history/2004-halftime-show-wardrobe-malfunction-overshadows-super-bowl-xxxviii\">the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show</a> – when Janet Jackson’s breast was exposed – was sufficient to punish CBS with a fine.</p>\n\n<p>In each of those cases, the FCC represented the views of the White House. And in each case, the regulatory agency was employed to pressure the networks into airing content more aligned with the administration’s ideology.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s interesting in those four examples is that two of the FCC chairmen were Democrats – Fly and Minow – and two were Republicans – Powell and Carr.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://cmj.umaine.edu/faculty-staff/michael-j-socolow/\">a media historian</a>, I’m aware of the long-existing bipartisan enthusiasm for exploiting the fact that no First Amendment exists in American broadcasting. Pressuring broadcasters by leveraging FCC power occurs regardless of which party controls the White House. And when the agency is used in partisan fashion, the rival party will criticize such politicization of regulation as a threat to free speech.</p>\n\n<p>This recurring cycle is made possible by the fact that broadcasting is licensed by the government. Since a <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep319/usrep319190/usrep319190.pdf\">Supreme Court decision in 1943</a>, the supremacy of the FCC in broadcast regulation has been unquestioned. </p>\n\n<p>Such strong governmental oversight separates broadcasting from any other medium of mass communication in the United States. And it’s the reason why there’s no “free speech” when it comes to Kimmel, or any other performer, on U.S. airwaves. </p>\n\n<h2>The FCC’s empowerment</h2>\n\n<p>Since its establishment in 1934, the FCC’s primary role in broadcasting has been to authorize local station licenses “<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/communications-act-1934.pdf\">in the public interest, convenience, or necessity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In 1938, the FCC began its first investigation into network practices and policies, which resulted in new regulations. One of the new rules stated that no network could own and operate more than one licensed station in any single market. This forced NBC, which owned two networks that operated stations in several markets, to divest itself of one of its networks. NBC sued. </p>\n\n<p>In the first serious constitutional test of the FCC’s full authority, in 1943, the Supreme Court vindicated the FCC’s expansive power over all U.S. broadcasting in its 5–4 verdict in <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/national-broadcasting-co-v-united-states/\">National Broadcasting Co. v. United States</a>. The ruling has stood since.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why there’s no First Amendment in broadcasting. The Supreme Court ruled that, due to spectrum scarcity – the idea that the airwaves are a limited public resource and therefore not every American can operate a broadcast station – the FCC’s power over broadcasting must be expansive.  </p>\n\n<p>The 1934 act, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/190/\">the 1943 Supreme Court decision read</a>, “gave the Commission … expansive powers … and a comprehensive mandate to ‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest,’ if need be, by making ‘special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain (network) broadcasting.’”</p>\n\n<p>The ruling also explains why the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/American-Broadcasting-Company\">FCC can be credited with having created the American Broadcasting Company</a>. Yes, the same ABC that suspended Kimmel in the face of FCC threats was the network that emerged from NBC’s forced divestiture of its Blue Network as a result of the 1943 Supreme Court decision. </p>\n\n<p>The empowerment of the FCC by NBC v. U.S. led to such content restrictions as <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/fairness-doctrine/\">the Fairness Doctrine</a>, which intended to ensure balanced political broadcasting, instituted in 1949, and later, additional FCC rules against obscenity and indecency on the airwaves. The Supreme Court decision also encouraged FCC chairmen to flex their regulatory muscles in public more often.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Black woman and white man sing onstage.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694887/original/file-20251007-56-31oepn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A federal appeals court ruled on Nov. 2, 2011, that CBS should not be fined US$550,000 for Janet Jackson’s infamous ‘wardrobe malfunction.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Janet%20Jackson%20wardrobe&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/David Phillip</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For example, when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-27-mn-16582-story.html\">CBS suspended news commentator Cecil Brown</a> in 1943 for truthful but critical news commentary about the U.S. World War II effort, FCC Chairman Fly expressed his displeasure with the network’s decision.</p>\n\n<p>“It is a little strange,” <a href=\"https://reason.com/2016/03/19/the-man-j-edgar-hoover-blamed/\">Fly told the press</a>, “that all Americans are to enjoy free speech except radio commentators.”</p>\n\n<p>When FCC Chairman Minow complained about television in the U.S. devolving into a “<a href=\"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/newtonminow.htm\">vast wasteland</a>” in 1961, the networks responded both defensively and productively. They invested far more money into news and public affairs programming. That led to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Expanding_Vista.html?id=-6dA8G5sOSAC\">significantly more news reporting and documentary production</a> throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n\n<h2>A ‘hands-off’ FCC</h2>\n\n<p>In the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0429/078.html\">FCC Chairman Powell promised</a> to “refashion the FCC into an outfit that is fast, decisive and, above all, hands-off.”  </p>\n\n<p>Yet his promise to be “hands-off” did not apply to content regulation. In 2004, his FCC concluded a contentious legal battle with Clear Channel Communications over comments ruled “indecent” by shock jock Howard Stern. The settlement resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/clear-channel-reaches-175-million-settlement-fcc/\">US$1.75 million payment by Clear Channel Communications</a> – the largest fine ever collected by the FCC for speech on the airwaves.  </p>\n\n<p>Powell apparently enjoyed policing content, as evidenced by the $550,000 fine his FCC levied against CBS for the fleeting exposure of singer Janet Jackson’s breast during the Super Bowl. The fine was <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/wardrobe-malfunction-case-finally-ends/\">eventually overturned</a>. But Powell did successfully <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-243802A3.pdf\">lobby Congress</a> to significantly hike the amount of money <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/broadcast-decency-enforcement-act-of-2005/\">the FCC could fine broadcasters for indecency</a>. The fine for a single incident increased from $32,000 to $325,000, and up to $3 million if a network broadcasts it on multiple stations. </p>\n\n<p>Powell’s regulatory activism, done mostly to curb the outrageous antics of radio shock jocks, resulted in some of the most significant and long-lasting <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=dltr\">restrictions on broadcast freedom in U.S. history</a>.  Thus, Carr’s 2025 threats toward ABC can be viewed in a historical context as an extension of established FCC activism. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Demonstrators holds signs in front of a building with columns.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694884/original/file-20251007-56-7o26bt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Demonstrators hold signs on Sept. 18, 2025, outside Los Angeles’ El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where the late-night show ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ is staged.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Jimmy%20Kimmel%20protest&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But Carr’s threat also appeared to contradict his previously espoused values. </p>\n\n<p>As the author of the FCC section in <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">Project 2025</a>, a conservative blueprint for federal government policies, Carr wrote: “The FCC should promote freedom of speech … and pro-growth reforms that support a diversity of viewpoints.” In exploiting the FCC’s licensing power to threaten to penalize speech he found offensive, Carr failed to promote either freedom of speech or diversity of viewpoints.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s one thing the Carr-Kimmel episode teaches us, it’s that more Americans should know the structural constraints in the U.S. system of broadcasting. Media literacy has proved essential as curbs to free expression – both official and unofficial – have become more popular.</p>\n\n<p>When the FCC threatens a broadcaster, it does so in Americans’ name. </p>\n\n<p>If Americans applaud regulatory activism when it supports their partisan beliefs, consistency demands they accept the same regulatory activism in the hands of their political opponents. If Americans prefer their political opposition show restraint in the regulation of broadcasting, then they need to promote restraint when their preferred administration is in power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266206/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michael J.

People in the United States can, for instance, join protests, criticize the government and say things that others find offensive.</p>\n\n<p>But the First Amendment only applies to the government – which includes public colleges and universities – and not private institutions or companies, including private colleges and universities. </p>\n\n<p>This means private colleges typically have wide authority to discipline <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-i/interpretations/266\">employees for their speech</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, public colleges are considered part of the government. The First Amendment limits the legal authority they have over their employees’ speech. This is <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/what-free-speech-rights-do-government-employees-have\">especially true when an employee is speaking as a private citizen</a> – such as participating in a political rally outside of work hours, for example. </p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 1968 case that public employees’ speech rights as private citizens can extend to criticizing their employer, like if they write a letter critical of their employer <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/510\">to a newspaper</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-473\">Supreme Court also ruled in 2006</a> that \nthe First Amendment does not protect public employees from being disciplined by their employers when they say or write something as part of their official job duties. </p>\n\n<p>Even when a public college employee is speaking outside of their job duties as a private citizen, they might not be guaranteed First Amendment protection. To reach this legal threshold, what they say must be about something of importance to the public, or <a href=\"https://houstonlawreview.org/article/73668-the-free-speech-of-public-employees-at-a-time-of-political-polarization-clarifying-the-_pickering_-balancing-test\">what courts call a “matter of public concern</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Talking or writing about news, politics or social matters – Kirk’s murder – often meets the legal test for when speech is about a matter of public concern. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, courts have ruled that personal workplace <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1251\">complaints or gossip typically does not</a> guarantee freedom of speech protection. </p>\n\n<p>And in some cases, even when a public employee speaks as a private citizen on a topic that a court considers a matter of public concern, their speech may still be unprotected. </p>\n\n<p>A public employer can still convince a court that its reasons for prohibiting an employee’s speech – like preventing conflict among co-workers – are important enough to deny this employee <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/pickering-balancing-test-for-government-employee-speech\">First Amendment protection</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Lawsuits brought by the employees of public colleges and universities who have been fired for their comments about Kirk may likely be decided based on whether what they said or wrote amounts to a matter of public concern. Another important factor is whether a court is convinced that an employee’s speech about Kirk was serious enough to disrupt a college’s operations, thus justifying the employee’s firing.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic freedom and professors’ speech</h2>\n\n<p>There are also questions over whether professors at public universities, in particular, can cite other legal rights to protect their speech. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://faculty.umd.edu/academic-freedom\">Academic freedom</a> refers to a faculty member’s rights connected to their <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/5/2/64\">teaching and research expertise</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At both private and public colleges, professors’ work contracts – like the ones typically <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/tenure\">signed after receiving tenure</a> – potentially provide legal protections for faculty speech connected to academic freedom, such as in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>However, the First Amendment does not apply to how a private college regulates its professors’ speech or academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Professors at public colleges have at least the same First Amendment free speech rights as their fellow employees, like when speaking in a private citizen capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the First Amendment might protect a public college professor’s work-related speech when academic freedom concerns arise, like in their teaching and research. </p>\n\n<p>In 2006, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the First Amendment covers academic freedom, in a case where it found the First Amendment did not cover what public employees say when carrying <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-473\">out their official work</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Supreme Court has not dealt with this complicated issue. And lower federal courts have reached conflicting decisions about First Amendment protection for public college professors’ speech in their teaching and research.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large gray stone plaque shows the First Amendment in front of a green grassy field and buildings in the distance.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695968/original/file-20251013-56-oy26u2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The First Amendment is on display in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/first-amendment-and-independence-hall-royalty-free-image/147097695?phrase=first%20amendment&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">StephanieCraig/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Future of free speech for university employees</h2>\n\n<p>Some colleges, especially public ones, are testing the legal limits of their authority over their employees’ speech. </p>\n\n<p>These incidents demonstrate a culture of <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/polarization-campuses-civil-discourse-dialogue-aacu-2025/738426/\">extreme political polarization</a> in higher education. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond legal questions, colleges are also grappling with how to define their commitments to free speech and academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we believe campus leaders should consider the purpose of higher education.

      "content": "<p>As millions of student loan borrowers settle into the school year, many are stressed about how they’ll pay for their degrees. These students may find that the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text/enr\">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>, the big tax and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, could limit how much they can borrow.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently, graduate students could take out two types of federal loans: <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>, which had a lifetime limit of US$138,500, and <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/grad\">Grad PLUS loans</a>, which allowed students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, minus financial aid.</p>\n\n<p>But Grad PLUS loans will be <a href=\"https://www.uclawsf.edu/admissions/financial-aid/important-federal-student-loan-changes-effective-july-1-2026/#:%7E:text=A.-,Key%20Changes,be%20available%20to%20new%20borrowers.\">eliminated</a> next summer, with a <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/uploads/documents/Federal_Student_Aid_Change_OB3.pdf\">three-year transitional period</a> for current borrowers. That will leave only the capped loans for new borrowers, and those loans have new lifetime borrowing limits: $200,000 for students pursuing certain <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477646/student-loan-repayment-forgiveness-trump\">professional degrees</a>, and $100,000 for nonprofessional graduate programs.</p>\n\n<p>If you add both undergraduate and graduate loans, there’s a new lifetime limit of $257,500 per person.</p>\n\n<p>That seems modest to me. Consider that the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/235651/us-university-attendance-cost/\">annual average costs</a> for an undergraduate degree range from <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cua\">$24,920 for in-state public universities</a> to <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cua\">$58,000 for private universities</a>. That means we’re looking at up to $224,000 for a bachelor’s degree. If we add three years of law school, we’re looking at <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/law/law-school-cost/\">an additional $132,000 to $168,000</a>, respectively. Alternatively, completing <a href=\"https://students-residents.aamc.org/financial-aid-resources/you-can-afford-medical-school\">four years of medical school</a> will set you back another $268,000 to $363,000. It’s not easy to make those numbers add up to less than $257,500.</p>\n\n<p>As I reflect on these numbers and my journey to becoming <a href=\"https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/rodney-coates.html\">a college professor</a>, specializing in race and ethnic studies, one thing becomes clear: I would never have been able to earn my bachelor’s degree, two master’s degrees, and Ph.D. under these new rules. </p>\n\n<p>Adjusting for inflation, I took out nearly $300,000 in student loans, and I paid them all off within a decade of starting my college teaching career. For me, the system worked. I wonder how today’s aspiring professionals, especially those from less prosperous backgrounds, will manage.</p>\n\n<h2>The future of professionals</h2>\n\n<p>Professional students already graduate with a lot of debt – often far more than the new loan caps will allow. In 2020, more than a quarter of graduating medical students and nearly 60% of graduating dental students had <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/60639/full-impact-changes-to-college-financial-aid-and-higher-ed/\">borrowed more than the new limits would allow</a>, author Mark Kantrowitz, <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/author/mkantrowitz/\">who is an expert on student loans</a>, has found. In 2024, <a href=\"https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/12846/download\">nearly a quarter of medical school graduates</a> left school with more than $300,000 in debt.</p>\n\n<p>The new borrowing limits will likely hit minority students especially hard. While about <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics\">61% of all graduate students take out student loans</a>, the share is <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics\">much higher</a> for Black students compared with white students, 48% to 17%. </p>\n\n<p>While some might be able to supplement their federal loans with private ones – which tend to have much worse terms for borrowers – I fear that many others will be forced to end their educations prematurely.</p>\n\n<p>That, in turn, would worsen the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-how-aspiring-black-doctors-see-trumps-new-loan-cap\">already severe shortage of doctors serving the Black community</a>. As pointed out in a <a href=\"http://doi.org/doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.6687\">2023 report of the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, the shortage of Black primary care physicians is directly related to overall lower population health and ultimately higher mortality rates within the Black community. As of 2023, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/health/black-doctors-shortage-us/index.html\">fewer than 6%</a> of U.S. doctors were Black, versus <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/\">14.4% of the population</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Research has suggested that student loan relief would <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac862\">help diversify the medical workforce</a>. Adding new restrictions would likely have the opposite effect, making the profession more homogeneous and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2020/09/when-it-comes-to-us-health-systems-diversity-matters.html\">significantly undermining Black public health</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or consider attorneys. Law school costs have risen <a href=\"https://clp.law.harvard.edu/knowledge-hub/magazine/issues/student-debt/the-black-white-student-debt-gap-among-law-school-graduates\">more than 600%</a> over the past two decades. The average 2020 law school graduate <a href=\"https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law-student-debt-averages-165k-at-graduation-creating-stress-and-restricting-choices-survey-says\">left with $165,000 in student debt</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Black law students face unique challenges, graduating with approximately 8% more debt on average than white students and facing <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/cew-roi_law.pdf\">significant wage disparities</a> once they enter the legal workforce. Making it harder for Black students to afford law school could reduce the <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/news/profile-legal-profession/demographics/\">number of Black attorneys</a>, which has held steady at about 5% of active lawyers over the past 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing access to federal student loans risks disproportionately affecting women, since they hold <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/issues/education/student-debt/\">roughly two-thirds of all student debt</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\n\n<p>Supporters of the change say that capping graduate student borrowing will <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\">encourage universities to rein in tuition hikes</a>. They also say <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/09/24/trump-is-slashing-grad-school-loans-these-companies-are-scrambling-to-step-in/\">private student loan providers</a> will step in to help students. I am skeptical, but the true test will come next year.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, professional students might want to familiarize themselves with the many scholarship opportunities available.

      "content": "<p>Surveillance pricing has dominated headlines recently. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/07/16/delta-moves-toward-eliminating-set-prices-in-favor-of-ai-that-determines-how-much-you-personally-will-pay-for-a-ticket/\">Delta Air Lines’ announcement</a> that it will use artificial intelligence to set individualized ticket prices has led to widespread concerns about companies using personal data to charge different prices for identical products. As The New York Times reported, this practice involves companies tracking everything <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/business/dealbook/personalized-pricing.html\">from your hotel bookings to your browsing history</a> to determine what you’re willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The reaction has been swift. Democratic lawmakers have responded with outrage, with Texas Rep. Greg Casar <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/2025-07-23-first-ever-ban-surveillance-pricing-congress-greg-casar/\">introducing legislation to ban the practice</a>. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s new chair of the Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-ftc-chair-culture-wars/\">shut down public comment on the issue</a>, signaling that the regulatory pendulum may swing away from oversight entirely.</p>\n\n<p>What’s missing in this political back-and-forth is a deeper look at the economics. As a <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/aradhna-krishna\">business school professor</a> who researches pricing strategy, I think the debate misses important nuances. Opponents of surveillance pricing overlook some potential benefits that could make markets both more efficient and, counterintuitively, more equitable.</p>\n\n<h2>What surveillance pricing actually is</h2>\n\n<p>Surveillance pricing differs from traditional <a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-dynamic-pricing\">dynamic pricing</a>, where prices rise for everyone at times of peak demand. Instead, it uses personal data – browsing history, location, purchase patterns, even device type – to charge a unique price based on what algorithms predict you’re willing to pay. </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to discover each customer’s “reservation price” – the most they’ll pay before walking away. Until recently, this was <a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/429/augmenting_conjoint_analysis_to_estimate_consumer_reservation_price.pdf\">extremely difficult to do</a>, but modern data collection has made it increasingly feasible.</p>\n\n<p>An FTC investigation found that companies track <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-surveillance-pricing-study-indicates-wide-range-personal-data-used-set-individualized-consumer\">highly personal consumer behaviors</a> to set individualized prices. For example, a new parent searching for “baby thermometers” might find pricier products on the first page of their results than a nonparent would. It’s not surprising that many people think this is unfair. </p>\n\n<h2>The unintended progressive tax</h2>\n\n<p>But consider this: Surveillance pricing also means that wealthy customers pay more for identical goods, while lower-income customers pay less. That means it could achieve redistribution goals typically pursued through government policy. Pharmaceutical companies already do this globally, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0891\">charging wealthier countries more</a> for identical drugs to make medications accessible in poorer nations. Surveillance pricing could function as a private-sector <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/progressive-tax/\">progressive tax system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Economists call it “<a href=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination\">price discrimination</a>,” but it often helps poorer consumers access goods they might otherwise be unable to afford. And unlike government programs, this type of redistribution requires no taxpayer funding. When Amazon’s algorithm charges me more than a college student for the same laptop, it’s effectively running a means-tested subsidy program – funded by consumers.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWm2RdzxObc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">PBS NewsHour featured a segment on the Delta Air Lines news.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The two-tier economy problem</h2>\n\n<p>In my view, the most legitimate concern about surveillance pricing isn’t that it exists, but how it’s implemented. Online retailers can seamlessly adjust prices in real time, while physical stores remain largely stuck with uniform pricing. Imagine the customer fury if Target’s checkout prices <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-lawsuits-california-target-corp-35db1e4f1ea1d43ef7a1f7f2b4630c41\">varied by person based on their smartphone data</a>: There could be chaos in the stores. This digital-physical divide could also create unfair advantages for tech-savvy companies while leaving traditional retailers behind. That would raise fairness considerations for consumers as well as retailers. </p>\n\n<p>This is related to another force that could limit how far surveillance pricing can go: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/beating-the-opal-and-other-acts-of-everyday-arbitrage-35845\">arbitrage</a>, or the practice of buying something where it is cheaper and selling it where it is more expensive. </p>\n\n<p>If a system consistently charges wealthy customers $500 for items that cost poor customers $200, it creates opportunities for entrepreneurial intermediaries to exploit these price gaps. Personal shopping services, buying cooperatives or even friends and family networks could arbitrage these differences, providing wealthy customers access to the lower prices while splitting the savings. This means surveillance pricing can’t discriminate too aggressively – market forces will erode excessive price gaps.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I believe the solution isn’t to ban surveillance pricing entirely, but to monitor how it is put in practice. </p>\n\n<h2>The regulatory sweet spot</h2>\n\n<p>The current political moment offers a strange opportunity. With Republicans focused on AI innovation and Democrats fixated on bans, there’s space for a more sophisticated position that embraces market-based redistribution while demanding strong consumer protections.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, smart regulation would require companies to disclose when personal data influences pricing, and would prohibit discrimination based on <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/protected_characteristic\">protected characteristics</a> such as race, color or religion – and this list needs to be created extremely carefully. This would preserve the efficiency benefits while preventing abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Surveillance pricing based on desperation or need also raises unique ethical questions. Charging a wealthier customer more for a taxi ride is one thing; charging someone extra <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/uber-surge-pricing-phone-battery/\">solely because their battery is low</a> and they risk being stranded is another.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, the distinction between ability to pay and urgency of need must become the cornerstone of regulation. While distinguishing the two may seem challenging, it’s far from impossible. It would help if customers were empowered to report exploitative practices, using mechanisms similar to existing <a href=\"https://www.scag.gov/price-gouging/\">price-gouging protections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A solid regulatory framework must also clarify the difference between dynamic pricing and surveillance-based exploitation. Dynamic pricing has long been standard practice: Airlines charge all last-minute travelers higher fares, regardless of their circumstances. But consider two passengers buying tickets on the same day – one rushing to a funeral, another planning a spontaneous vacation. Right now, airlines can use technology to identify and exploit the funeral attendee’s desperate circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The policy challenge is precise: Can we design regulations that prevent airlines from exploiting the bereaved while still allowing retailers to offer discounts on laptops to lower-income families? The answer will determine whether surveillance pricing becomes a tool for equity or exploitation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266293/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Aradhna Krishna does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>When Starbucks announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/starbucks-is-discontinuing-mobile-order-and-pickup-only-stores\">phase out its mobile-order pickup-only locations</a> beginning in 2026, it raised a question: Why abandon a format seemingly built for speed and efficiency?</p>\n\n<p>As Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">explained the decision</a> in an earnings call, the pickup-only stores had a “transactional” feel, lacking “the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.” </p>\n\n<p>While Niccol also touted the mobile-order options at its traditional coffee shops, I see Starbucks’ move as an attempt to return to its roots as a “<a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/emea/stories/2024/reclaiming-third-places-our-bold-vision-for-community-stores\">third place</a>” – a destination between home and work where people can gather and connect. </p>\n\n<p>But this sort of pivot comes with trade-offs – and it creates interesting market opportunities for competitors. As a <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/vivek-astvansh\">marketing professor</a> and a coffee connoisseur, I’m offering this analysis to go with your morning cup of joe.</p>\n\n<h2>The two types of coffee shop patrons</h2>\n\n<p>In general, coffee shops attract two distinct customer segments. The first are what I call “stay-and-savor” customers – people who mostly use the site as a place to meet others or work. Their primary interest is in the space, not the mocha or muffins.</p>\n\n<p>The second are “grab-and-go” customers – people who want a consistent product, delivered efficiently. They don’t linger at the store, so the place is less important to them than convenience, speed and product quality. Think of the morning rush at your local coffee joint. </p>\n\n<p>Starbucks’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxLbVL8cpYY\">pickup-only stores</a>, branded as <a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/stores-and-ordering/pickup/\">Starbucks PICK UP</a>, cater to grab-and-go customers. If you don’t live in a busy area, you might never have heard of the brand: There are <a href=\"https://www.westsidecurrent.com/news/main-street-starbucks-in-santa-monica-among-locations-slated-for-closure/article_9e15a29b-8196-4955-b399-b18a8a411540.html\">fewer than 100</a> Starbucks PICK UPs, many in densely packed cities.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, there are about 17,000 <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Starbucks-USA/\">sit-in Starbucks stores</a> across the United States. That means its plan will affect just 0.5% of its locations. That’s not very much.</p>\n\n<p>So why does this change have me a little, well, steamed up?</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the third place, whether you like it or not</h2>\n\n<p>As I said before, I see this move as part of an effort <a href=\"https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2025/brian-niccol-and-howard-schultz-on-reclaiming-the-third-place-and-delivering-performance-through-the-lens-of-humanity/\">to emphasize “stay-and-savor” customers</a> over their “grab-and-go” counterparts. Indeed, Niccol’s recent earnings call presentation claimed that Starbucks is “<a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">prioritizing warmth, connection and community</a>.” Starbucks also publishes a document stating its “<a href=\"https://content-prod-live.cert.starbucks.com/binary/v2/asset/137-72999.pdf\">principles for upholding the third place</a>,” and its commitment seems to be more than just rhetorical.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that <a href=\"https://merchants.doordash.com/en-us/blog/profit-margins-restaurant-businesses\">coffee shops aren’t like regular restaurants</a> in terms of menu prices and customer spending. “Stay-and-savor” customers are costly to serve for coffee shops, and may generate insufficient revenue, making them <a href=\"https://merchants.doordash.com/en-us/blog/profit-margins-restaurant-businesses\">less profitable</a>. That could be bad for the bottom line.</p>\n\n<p>The change could also have unintended consequences for workers and customers. For example, pickup-only stores allow employees to focus on food and beverage preparation, with less pressure to engage in small talk in the hopes of generating warmth and tips. Indeed, much academic research has shown that restaurant workers who serve customers report more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2024.103955\">emotional labor and stress</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1265581\">and worse morale and well-being</a> than those who don’t.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Starbucks’ rivals, such as <a href=\"https://www.restaurantnewsresource.com/article72209.html\">Dunkin’</a> and the Chinese new entrant <a href=\"https://investor.luckincoffee.com/news-releases/news-release-details/luckin-coffee-announces-smart-unmanned-retail-strategy-bringing\">Luckin Coffee</a>, have embraced the grab-and-go customers. These rivals provide space for seating space, but they don’t elevate their positioning as if their baristas are serving warmth, connection and community. </p>\n\n<p>Starbucks CEO Niccol has described the plan as a “<a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/SBUX-3Q25-Corrected-Transcript.pdf\">sunsetting</a>.” I’d watch out for Dunkin’ and Luckin Coffee, and of course, Starbucks’ financials in 2026, to determine whether the Starbucks sun sets or rises.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262591/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Vivek Astvansh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions. </p>\n\n<p>Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Corporations publish their pollution data</h2>\n\n<p>A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/epcra\">significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals</a> to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them.</p>\n\n<p>That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program\">Toxics Release Inventory</a>. That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/pollution-prevention-p2-and-tri\">cleaner methods</a> and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/introduction-2023-tri-national-analysis\">3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals</a> (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/releases-chemicals\">21% decrease from 2014</a>. The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases. </p>\n\n<p>The 2023 releases came from over <a href=\"https://awsgispub.epa.gov/trina2023/summary/#map\">21,600 industrial facilities</a> in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/states-and-metropolitan-areas\">Texas, Ohio and California</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"PxCgi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PxCgi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/releases-chemical-and-industry\">78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-021-00664-7\">economically disadvantaged, rural or minority</a> communities. </p>\n\n<p>But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">corporate characteristics</a> matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength.</p>\n\n<p>In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146169\">more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases</a> than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income.</p>\n\n<p>We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated.</p>\n\n<p>The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site.</p>\n\n<p>But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"wP87w\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wP87w/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The role of innovation</h2>\n\n<p>One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/searching-for-patents/helpful-resources/first-time-here/patent-families\">patent families</a>, which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample.</p>\n\n<p>We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment.</p>\n\n<h2>Size and profitability matter, too</h2>\n\n<p>We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns.</p>\n\n<p>We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"UUdKf\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UUdKf/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.</p>\n\n<p>Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/\">income statements obtained from PitchBook</a>, a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265227/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Callais</a>, with major implications for the Voting Rights Act, racial representation and Democratic Party power in congress.</p>\n\n<p>The central question in the case is to what extent race can, or must, be used when congressional districts are redrawn. Plaintiffs are challenging whether the longstanding interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, which requires protection of minority voting power in redistricting, violates the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection\">Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution</a>, which guarantees that individuals should be treated the same by the law. </p>\n\n<p>In short, the plaintiffs argue that the state of Louisiana’s use of race to make a second Black-majority district is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/supreme-court-louisiana-redistricting-voting-rights-act\">second time</a> that the court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-in-pivotal-case-on-the-voting-rights-act/\">after no decision was reached last term</a>. From my perspective as a <a href=\"https://www.simmons.edu/people/sam-hayes\">scholar of U.S. federal courts and electoral systems</a>, this case represents the collision of decades of Supreme Court decisions on race, redistricting and the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<h2>Long legal battle</h2>\n\n<p>To understand the stakes of the current case, it’s important to know what the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47520\">Voting Rights Act</a> does. Initially passed in 1965, the act helped end decades of racially discriminatory voting laws by providing federal enforcement of voting rights. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/election-law-explainers/section-2-of-the-voting-rights-act-vote-dilution-and-vote-deprivation/\">forbids discrimination by states</a> in relation to voting rights and has been used for decades to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>The current case has its roots in the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census\">redistricting of Louisiana’s congressional districts</a> following the 2020 Census. States are required to redraw districts each decade based on new population data. Louisiana lawmakers redrew the state’s six congressional districts without major changes in 2022.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Police smashing marchers on a street with billy clubs.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">State troopers in Selma, Ala., swing billy clubs on March 7, 1965, to break up a march by advocates for Black Americans’ voting rights.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Voting%20Rights%20Act%201965&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Soon after the state redistricted, a group of Black voters challenged the map in federal court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the new map was discriminatory because the voting power of Black citizens in the state was being illegally diluted. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-race-and-ethnicity-legislature-census-2020-baton-rouge-5e4b92df3831434909bf37d95abd2151\">The state’s population was 31% Black</a>, but only one of the six districts featured a majority-Black population.</p>\n\n<p>The federal courts in 2022 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-john-bel-edwards-louisiana-baton-rouge-congress-78cae5a254ffa6bcb460139600e60099\">sided with the plaintiffs’ claim</a> that the plan did violate the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state legislature to redraw the congressional plan with a second Black-majority district.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://redistricting.lls.edu/wp-content/uploads/la-2020-robinson-220606-order.pdf\">judges relied on an interpretation of Section 2</a> of the Voting Rights Act from a 1986 Supreme Court decision in the <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968\">case known as Thornburg v. Gingles</a>. Under this interpretation, Section 2’s nondiscrimination requirement means that congressional districts must be drawn in a way that allows large, politically cohesive and compact racial minorities to be able to elect representatives of their choice. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-in-unconstitutional-districts-us-supreme-court-upended-decades-of-precedent-in-2022-by-allowing-voters-to-vote-with-gerrymandered-maps-instead-of-fixing-the-congressional-districts-first-227124\">a similar racial gerrymandering case in Alabama</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Louisiana lawmakers redraw districts</h2>\n\n<p>Following the court order, the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/03/court-weighs-louisiana-redistricting-with-second-majority-black-district/\">Louisiana state legislature passed Senate Bill 8</a> in January 2024, redrawing the congressional map and creating two districts where Black voters composed a substantial portion of the electorate in compliance with the Gingles ruling. This map was used in <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_elections,_2024\">the 2024 congressional election</a> and both Black-majority districts elected Democrats, while the other four districts elected Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>These new congressional districts from Senate Bill 8 were challenged by a group of white voters in 2024 in a set of cases that became <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-109_l53m.pdf\">Louisiana v. Callais</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that the Louisiana legislature’s drawing of districts based on race in Senate Bill 8 was in violation of the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/\">14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause</a>, which requires equal treatment of individuals by the government, and the 15th Amendment, <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv\">which forbids denying the right to vote based on race</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the plaintiffs claimed that the courts’ interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional and that the use of race to create a majority-minority district is itself discriminatory. Similar arguments about the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause were also the basis of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">striking down race-based affirmative action in college admissions</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, a three-judge district court sided with the white plaintiffs in Louisiana v. Callais, with a 2-1 decision. The Black plaintiffs <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370938/20250827153950778_24-109%2024-110%20Louisiana%20v%20Callais%20et%20al%20Supplemental%20Brief%20for%20Robinson%20Defendants.pdf?inline=1\">from the original case</a>, and the state of Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370895/20250827134212077_Callais%20-%20Supplemental%20Opening%20Merits%20Brief.pdf?inline=1\">appealed the case to the Supreme Court</a>.

Callais, deciding that Louisiana’s congressional districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, it will have substantial impacts on minority representation. The decision would upend decades of precedent for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">For 39 years</a>, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has required redistricting institutions to consider racial and ethnic minority representation when devising congressional districts. <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Majority-minority_districts\">Majority-minority districting</a> is required when a state has large, compact and cohesive minority communities. Historically, some states have redistricted minority communities in ways that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act\">dilute their voting power, such as “cracking”</a> a community into multiple districts where they compose a small percentage of the electorate. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 also provides voters and residents with a legal tool that has been used to challenge districts as discriminatory. Many voters and groups have used Section 2 successfully to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 has been the main legal tool for challenging racial discrimination in redistricting for the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively ended the other major component of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, which required certain states to have <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/shelby-county-v-holder\">changes to their elections laws approved by the federal government</a>, including redistricting. </p>\n\n<p>If the court overrules the current interpretation of Section 2, it would limit the legality of using race in redistricting, end requirements for majority-minority districts and eliminate the most common way to challenge discriminatory districting.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, because of the strong relationship between many <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/\">minority communities and the Democratic party</a>, the court’s decision has major implications for partisan control of the House of Representatives. </p>\n\n<p>If Section 2 no longer required majority-minority districts, then Republicans could use the ruling to redraw congressional districts across the country to benefit their party. Politico reported that Democrats could <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/republicans-scotus-vra-00597212\">lose as many as 19 House seats</a> if the Supreme Court sides with the lower court. </p>\n\n<p>Recent Supreme Court precedent gives conflicting signals as to how it will decide this case. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the court rejected a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-in-unconstitutional-districts-us-supreme-court-upended-decades-of-precedent-in-2022-by-allowing-voters-to-vote-with-gerrymandered-maps-instead-of-fixing-the-congressional-districts-first-227124\">challenge to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> related to Alabama’s congressional districts. In 2024, the court overruled a lower court’s finding of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-rights-at-risk-after-supreme-court-makes-it-harder-to-challenge-racial-gerrymandering-232359\">racial vote dilution in South Carolina</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267269/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sam D.

During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create <a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/about/k-12-education/severe-weather/hurricane-simulation\">computer simulations to forecast</a> how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you’re trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating <a href=\"https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/research/theory-computational-methods/space-weather-modeling-framework/\">these simulations gets a little more complex</a>. To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the Sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place.</p>\n\n<p>Space weather is very different from the storms you see on Earth. These events come from the Sun, which ejects eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields from its surface. The most powerful of these events are called <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\">interplanetary coronal mass ejections</a>, or CMEs, which travel at speeds approaching 1,800 miles per second (2,897 kilometers per second). </p>\n\n<p>To put that in perspective, a single CME could move a mass of material equivalent to all the Great Lakes from New York City to Los Angeles in just under two seconds – almost faster than it takes to say “space weather.”</p>\n\n<p>When these CMEs hit Earth, they can <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms\">cause geomagnetic storms</a>, which manifest in the sky as beautiful auroras.

This work had found geomagnetic storms occurring during periods when no solar eruptions were predicted to hit Earth. </p>\n\n<p>Bewildered, the space weather expert wanted to know if there could be space weather events that were smaller than coronal mass ejections and did not originate directly from solar eruptions. He predicted that such events might form in the space between the Sun and Earth, instead of in the Sun’s atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>One example of such smaller space weather events is a magnetic flux rope – bundles of magnetic fields wrapped around each other like a rope. Its detection in computer simulations of solar eruptions would hint to where these space weather events may be forming. Unlike satellite observations, in simulations you can turn back the clock or track an event upstream to see where they originate.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NkQmnuCsGM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Sometimes the Sun ejects masses of plasma and magnetic field lines, called coronal mass ejections.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So he asked the other author, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l4z7PzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a leading simulation expert</a>. It turned out that finding smaller space weather events was not as simple as simulating a big solar eruption and letting the computer model run long enough for the eruption to reach Earth. Current computer simulations are not meant to resolve these smaller events. Instead, they are designed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRzID3ZNqY\">focus on the large solar eruptions</a> because these have the most effects on infrastructure on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>This shortfall was quite disappointing. It was like trying to forecast a hurricane with a simulation that only shows you global weather patterns. Because you can’t see a hurricane at that scale, you would completely miss it.</p>\n\n<p>These larger-scale simulations are known as global simulations. They study how solar eruptions form on the Sun’s surface and travel through space. These simulations treat streams of charged particles and magnetic fields floating through space as fluids to reduce the computational cost, compared with modeling every charged particle independently. It’s like measuring the overall temperature of water in a bottle, instead of tracking every single water molecule individually.</p>\n\n<p>Because these simulations are computational phenomena that happen across such a vast space, they can’t resolve every detail. To affordably resolve the vast space between the Sun and the planets, researchers divide the space into large cubes – analogous to two-dimensional pixels in a camera. In the simulation, these cubes each represent an area 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) wide, tall and across. That distance is equivalent to about 1% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. </p>\n\n<h2>The search begins</h2>\n\n<p>Our search began with what felt like hunting for a needle in a haystack. We were looking into old global simulations, searching for a tiny, transient blob – which would signify a flux rope – within an area of space hundreds of times wider than the Sun itself. Our initial search did not yield anything.</p>\n\n<p>We then shifted our focus to the simulations of the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/\">May 2024 solar eruption event</a>. This time, we specifically looked at the region where the solar eruption collided into a quiet flow of charged particles and magnetic fields, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-solar-storms-and-the-solar-wind-3-astrophysicists-explain-how-particles-coming-from-the-sun-interact-with-earth-264013\">called the solar wind</a>, ahead of it. </p>\n\n<p>There it was: a distinct system of <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2544/1/012002\">magnetic flux ropes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, our excitement was short-lived. We could not tell where these flux ropes came from. The modeled flux ropes were also too small to survive, eventually fizzling out because they became too small to resolve with our simulation grid. </p>\n\n<p>But that was the type of clue we needed – the presence of flux ropes at the location where the solar eruption collided with the solar wind.</p>\n\n<p>To settle the issue, we decided to bridge this gap and create a computer model with a finer grid size than those previous global simulations used. Since increasing the resolution across the entire simulation space would have been prohibitively expensive, we decided to only increase the simulation resolution along the trajectory of the flux ropes. </p>\n\n<p>The new simulations could now resolve features that spanned distances six times Earth’s 8,000-mile (or 128,000-kilometer) diameter down to tens of thousands of miles – nearly 100 times better than previous simulations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A comparison of low and enhanced simulation grid sizes.

The results were astonishing. </p>\n\n<p>The high-resolution view revealed that the flux ropes formed when the solar eruption slammed into the slower solar wind ahead of it. The new structures possessed incredible complexity and strength that persisted far longer than we expected. In meteorological terms, it was like watching a hurricane spawn a cluster of tornadoes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adf855\">We found that</a> the magnetic fields in these vortices were strong enough to trigger a significant geomagnetic storm and cause some real trouble here on Earth. But most importantly, the simulations confirmed that there are indeed space weather events that form locally in the space between the Sun and Earth. Our next step is to simulate how such tornado-like features in the solar wind may impact our planet and infrastructure.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph6u6No_8sY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">This two-dimensional cut of the simulation box shows a solar eruption that moves toward Earth quickly.

I believe the cause is an issue called response error. It means that respondents don’t interpret a question in the way the researcher thinks they will. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the answers people provide don’t really reflect what the researcher thinks the answers show.</p>\n\n<p>For example, asking whether someone would support the use of force to achieve a political goal raises the question of what the respondent thinks “use of force” means in this context. It could be interpreted as violence, but it could also be interpreted as using legal means to “force” someone to do something. </p>\n\n<p>Such response errors have been a concern for pollsters <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_of_Asking_Questions/GPD_AwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">ever since survey research began</a>. They can affect even seemingly straightforward questions. </p>\n\n<h2>What did you mean by that?</h2>\n\n<p>To avoid this problem, I used an <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/products/engage/\">AI interviewing system</a> developed by <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/\">CloudResearch</a>, a well-known survey research company, to ask respondents some of the same questions about political violence from previous surveys. Then I used it to ask what they were thinking when they answered those questions. This process is called <a href=\"https://www.hkr.se/contentassets/9ed7b1b3997e4bf4baa8d4eceed5cd87/gordonwillis.pdf/\">cognitive interviewing</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I then used AI to go through these interviews and categorize them. Two short reports that summarize this process as applied to both polls are <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report.html\">available</a> <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report2.html\">online</a>. These analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the results should be considered very preliminary.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the results clearly demonstrate that respondents interpret these questions in very different ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Nuance matters</h2>\n\n<p>For example, in my survey, about 33% of Democrats agreed with the statement that “use of force is justified to remove President Trump from office.” However, when asked why they agreed, more than 57% gave responses like this: “I was not thinking physically but more in the sense that he – the president – might need to be ‘fired’ or forced out of office due to rules or laws.” Still others were envisioning future scenarios where a president illegally seizes power in a coup.</p>\n\n<p>Once you account for these different interpretations of the question, the AI only coded about 8% of Democrats as supporting use of force in violent terms under current conditions. </p>\n\n<p>Even here, there was substantial ambiguity – for example, this type of response was not unusual: “The language ‘use of force’ was a bit too broad for me. I could not justify killing Trump, for example, but less extreme uses of force were valid in my eyes.”</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, 29% of Republicans agreed that “use of the military is justified to stop protests against President Trump’s agenda.” However, almost all of the respondents who agreed with this statement envisioned the National Guard interceding nonviolently to stop violent protests and riots. Only about 2.6% of Republicans gave comments supporting use of the military against nonviolent protests.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all those who agreed that use of the military was justified expressed thoughts like this: “I see the military coming and acting as a police force to stop or prevent the demonstrations that become violent. Peaceful protesters must be allowed to exercise their right to free speech.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is political violence justified?</h2>\n\n<p>Even questions that explicitly ask about political violence are open to wide interpretation. Take, for example, this question: “Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to resort to violence in order to achieve political goals?” </p>\n\n<p>The lack of a specific scenario or location in this question invites respondents to engage in all kinds of philosophical and historical speculation. </p>\n\n<p>In my survey, almost 15% of respondents said violence could sometimes be justified. When asked about the examples they were thinking of, respondents cited the American Revolution, the anti-Nazi French Resistance and many other incidents as a reason for their responses. Only about 3% of respondents said they were thinking about actions in the U.S. at the current time.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, almost all respondents stated that violence should be a last resort when all other peaceful and legal methods fail.</p>\n\n<p>One respondent illustrated both problems with one sentence: “The (American) colonists tried petitions and negotiations first, but, when those efforts failed, they resorted to armed conflict to gain independence.”</p>\n\n<h2>A call for understanding</h2>\n\n<p>Even these numbers likely overestimate Americans’ support for political violence. I read the interviews, checking the AI system’s labeling, and concluded that, if anything, it was overestimating support for violence.</p>\n\n<p>Other factors may also be distorting reports of public support for political violence. Many surveys are conducted primarily online. One study estimated that anywhere from 4% to 7% of respondents in online surveys are “<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/assessing-the-risks-to-online-polls-from-bogus-respondents/\">bogus respondents</a>” who are selecting arbitrary responses. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2116870119\">Another study</a> reported that such respondents dramatically increase positive responses on questions about political violence.</p>\n\n<p>Respondents may also be willing to espouse attitudes anonymously online that they would never say or do in real life. Studies have suggested that “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/1094931041291295\">online disinhibition effects</a>” or “<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131087\">survey trolling</a>” can impact survey results.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, my preliminary research suggests that response error is a substantial problem in surveys about political violence. </p>\n\n<p>Americans almost universally condemn the recent political violence they have witnessed. The recent poll results showing otherwise more likely stem from confusion about what the questions are asking than actual support for political violence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266113/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Kennedy does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Only when finally captured did we discover this wily brown anole was <a href=\"https://www.anoleannals.org/2019/06/14/weird-lizard-with-three-and-a-half-legs/\">missing its entire left hind leg</a>.

Our research uncovered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737525\">122 cases of limb loss across 58 lizard species</a> and revealed that these “three-legged pirates” – the rare survivors of traumatic injuries – can run just as fast, maintain healthy body weight, reproduce successfully and live surprisingly long lives.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, most lizards probably do not survive such devastating injuries.

For decades, scientists have demonstrated that even tiny differences in leg length between individual lizards can mean the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54302-1\">difference between life and death</a> – affecting their ability to escape predators, catch prey and find mates.</p>\n\n<p>Since subtle variations matter so much, biologists have long assumed that losing an entire limb should be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>Yet our global survey tells a different story about these remarkable survivors. Working with colleagues across six continents, we found limb-damaged lizards across nearly all major lizard families, from tiny geckos to massive iguanas.</p>\n\n<p>These animals had clearly healed from whatever trauma caused their injuries – likely accidents or the failed attempts of a predator to eat them. Perhaps most remarkably, we documented surviving limb loss even in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2009.07.001\">chameleons, tree-climbing specialists</a> whose movements seem to require perfect limb coordination.</p>\n\n<h2>Thriving, not just surviving</h2>\n\n<p>The body condition of these lizards was most surprising. Rather than appearing malnourished, many limb-damaged lizards were actually heavier than expected for their size, suggesting they were successfully finding food despite their handicap. Some were actively reproducing, with females found carrying eggs and males observed successfully mating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"4 side by side X-ray images in black and white of small lizards each missing a limb\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Limb damage can be fairly common in some lizard populations, such as these X-rays of brown anoles (<em>Anolis sagrei</em>) from the Bahamas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jason Kolbe/Jonathan Losos</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These findings force us to reconsider some basic assumptions about how evolution might work in wild populations.

To an untrained eye, a small piece of radium may look like a chip off a regular gray rock. But radium can invisibly emit radiation – energy and small fragments of itself – that you can’t feel, see or smell. And that invisible radiation can hurt you, without you even noticing right away. </p>\n\n<p>What’s going on with this silent threat that can stealthily damage your body in ways that can take years to reveal themselves? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chemistry.richmond.edu/faculty/kdonald/\">As a chemist</a>, I’m interested in what makes different elements safe to handle or hazardous. This dangerous release of radiation is called radioactivity, and even though its source may look unassuming, it can burn you or even give you diseases that don’t manifest for years.</p>\n\n<h2>Atoms and isotopes</h2>\n\n<p>Everything you see around you – your skin, rocks, the pages of books – is all made up of different combinations of <a href=\"https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/A00493\">extremely small particles called atoms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An atom has a small, dense center called the nucleus. Negatively charged particles called electrons move around the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, there are two types of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons.</p>\n\n<p>All atoms with the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">same number of protons in their nuclei</a> are <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/\">the same element</a>. Besides radium, some elements you may have heard of are carbon and oxygen. All carbon atoms have six protons and all oxygen atoms have eight protons.

Once past a threshold, the changes reinforce themselves, amplifying until the system transforms into something new.</p>\n\n<p>Almost as soon as “tipping points” entered the climate science lexicon — following Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 book, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” — scientists warned the public <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/441785a\">not to confuse global warming policy benchmarks with precise thresholds</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A tall glacier front seen from above shows huge chunks of ice calving off into Disko Bay.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Greenland ice sheet, which is 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick at its thickest point, has been losing mass for several years as temperatures rise and more of its ice is lost to the ocean.

Instead, different elements in the climate system have risks of tipping that increase with each fraction of a degree of warming.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the beginning of a slow collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which could <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/ice-sheet-quick-facts\">raise global sea level</a> by about 24 feet (7.4 meters), is one of the most likely tipping elements in a world more than 1.5 C warmer than preindustrial times. Some models place the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1449\">critical threshold at 1.6 C</a> (2.9 F). More recent simulations <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090471\">estimate runaway conditions at 2.7 C</a> (4.9 F) of warming.

Reports suggest employees <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/nationwide-flight-delays-loom-as-air-traffic-controllers-call-out-sick/\">have been calling in sick</a> in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/airlines-urge-patience-us-air-traffic-staffing-issues-continue-2025-10-10/\">thousands of flights delayed or canceled</a> since the shutdown began.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. asked <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/strzempkowski.1\">Brian Strzempkowski</a> and <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/dickman.49\">Melanie Dickman</a>, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.</em> </p>\n\n<h2>How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?</h2>\n\n<p>Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-workers-back-bay-shutdown-785eb776d2312d1f68f7e91961d0a93a\">created some uncertainty</a> around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2020/05/29/the-most-stressful-job-in-the-world-what-its-really-like-to-be-an-air-traffic-controller/\">most stressful jobs there is</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, there have been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/airports-face-delays-as-shutdown-deepens-air-traffic-control-staffing-woes\">reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick</a> in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the <a href=\"https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/news/us-shutdown-faa-training-airlines-warning/\">2018-2019 shutdown</a>, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills. </p>\n\n<p>In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers\">threatened to fire these “problem children</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>What does this mean for people about to take a flight?</h2>\n\n<p>Before the shutdown, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5544703-airport-delays-government-shutdown/\">there was already a critical shortage</a> of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.</p>\n\n<p>A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety.</p>\n\n<p>The air traffic control system <a href=\"https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/ap-this-redundant-aviation-safety-net-helps-keep-planes-safe-when-controllers-lose-contact/\">is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it</a> to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate. </p>\n\n<p>As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/EWR-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2014.pdf\">can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft</a> departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">capacity was limited</a> to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">was personally involved</a> in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a colorful plane flies near the top of an air traffic control tower\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CongressFAA/1336d24012c9446bbc4fee9d90918c07/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How does the US keep air travel safe?</h2>\n\n<p>On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/nas_ops/atcscc\">Air Traffic Control System Command Center</a>, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system. </p>\n\n<p>When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/air-traffic-controllers-working-pay-begin-call-sick/story?id=126289491\">recently reporting that no controllers were available</a>, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace. </p>\n\n<h2>Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">systemic problem with hiring</a> of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">FAA’s plan to utilize colleges</a> across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/fclassiles/2025-09/DOT_Shutdown_Plan_9.30.25.pdf\">limited funding</a> from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown <a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/faa-academy-okc-shutdown-air-traffic-control-trainees/68992559\">can remain for many months</a> after the government reopens.  </p>\n\n<h2>What’s the government doing to end the shortage?</h2>\n\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/07/01/bill-fix-air-traffic-control-system/83788771007/\">Congress authorized over US$12 billion</a> in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary Duffy <a href=\"https://www.executivegov.com/articles/dot-duffy-faa-prime-contractor-air-traffic-control\">is currently leading an effort</a> to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-administration-needs-another-19-billion-fully-revamp-air-traffic-control-2025-07-16/\">additional $19 billion investment</a> will be needed to complete the task.</p>\n\n<p><em>The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267093/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Melanie Dickman is a member-at-large of Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA)</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brian Strzempkowski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The most widespread conservation challenge the report identifies is climate change. </p>\n\n<p>Climate-related changes in biological conditions such as ocean acidity, salt concentrations, sediment buildup, droughts, flooding and groundwater flow, and variable temperatures are considered “high” or “very high” threats to 117 of the 271 heritage sites evaluated – 43% of them. </p>\n\n<p>One-third of the 50 World Heritage sites that contain glaciers will see those glaciers disappear by 2050, the report projects.</p>\n\n<p>Around the world, <a href=\"https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php\">coral reefs have been, and are still, bleaching</a> – turning white as the colorful organisms that build and inhabit them die off – affecting 30% of the 29 World Heritage-listed coral reef ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, invasive species are encroaching on World Heritage sites. For example, in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, <a href=\"https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/about-galapagos/conservation-challenges/invasive-species/\">invasive species like rats and feral cats</a> are considered one of the main causes of extinctions, including to the islands’ famous birds. In Australia’s Gondwana Rainforest, the last vestiges of an ancient plant and animal “<a href=\"https://www.wettropics.gov.au/living-museum\">living museum</a>” are retreating due to invading non-native species.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People walk along a path near the face of a large swath of white and blue ice.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Tourists view the face of the Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/august-2025-argentina-perito-moreno-tourists-look-out-over-news-photo/2228085187\">Romina Cruz/picture alliance via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Threats from people</h2>\n\n<p>Additional human pressures are also endangering these unique areas. Threats to these sites from the outside include logging and mining in the region, developing nearby land, diverting natural water flows, and polluting the air, water and land. Roughly two-thirds of the sites studied face at least some danger from human activities happening outside the sites’ formal boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the report says heritage sites need more financial support to be better able to respond to key threats. It finds that most lack consistent, long-term funding for staff salaries, ecosystem monitoring, and continued <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/document/221425\">maintenance of protection programs</a>. Chronic underfunding is the primary barrier to effective ecosystem management. Funding typically comes from organizations such as the World Heritage Fund or the <a href=\"https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/publications/gef-8-corporate-scorecard-june-2025\">Global Environment Facility</a>, an organization made up of 186 member countries, institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector that funds environmental projects worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The IUCN report warns that even effective initiatives may struggle in the long term without stronger regional, national and global support. That could include efforts like the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/984/\">Okavango’s Community Management for Protected Areas Conservation</a> program, which connects rural communities and conservationists to support both people and nature.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Armed people in camouflage clothing walk through a wooded area.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Members of the Lion Intervention Brigade conduct an anti-poaching patrol at Niokolo-Koba National Park, Senegal.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateSenegalIllegalBigCatTrade/93754acdb53249efb201a846cfc2f1d8/photo\">AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What is missing from the 2025 report?</h2>\n\n<p>There is good news, though. Targeted local action, such as <a href=\"https://iucnsos.org/projects/stopping-the-bleeding-increased-enforcement-capacity-for-thailands-thap-lan-national-park-to-address-rampant-rosewood-poaching/\">anti-poaching efforts</a> and local community involvement, have improved conditions at four sites in West and Central Africa, shifting their status from “critical” to “significant concern.”</p>\n\n<p>There is more to know about these sites and how they are faring. As a community-based conservation scholar, I recognize that while the major drivers of ecological decline can be gleaned from published research, specific causes of that decline are best learned on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>The outlook provides critical environmental trends, but it could be strengthened by including specifics based on quantitative, community-based monitoring, such as wildlife population surveys by local experts. For instance, at a conference I attended in 2024, a frog biologist from Botswana observed that, before her work, the previous frog study in that part of the delta was in 1980.</p>\n\n<p>While critical local and Indigenous knowledge is recognized in the report, it is largely excluded from assessments, both because weaving it with conventional scientific analysis is difficult or because communities may choose to protect certain knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The Okavango Delta is one of many World Heritage sites, living landscapes rich with local cultural value and global significance. Like many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13304\">remote heritage sites outside Europe and North America</a>, there is a lot that remains unknown about biodiversity in the Okavango. </p>\n\n<p>The report acknowledges that recognizing the relationship between people and the environment would also improve future assessments. Overall, it offers a clear picture of global conservation trends while also acknowledging local realities and successes: for the heritage sites across the planet, conservation succeeds when people and nature thrive together.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266548/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jessica Beaudette received dissertation funding from the American Association of University Women and Arizona State University for field research in Botswana. </span></em></p>",

And her courage in having participated in an unfair contest and in exposing Maduro’s fraud by <a href=\"https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2024-07-30-u1-e207888-s27061-nid286010-maria-corina-machado-publica-actas-votacion-poder\">publishing the true vote tallies</a> on the internet, surely made Machado stand out to the Nobel committee.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in making Machado the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html\">2025 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a>, organizers <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2025/machado/facts/\">stated they were recognizing</a> her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”</p>\n\n<p>But as a <a href=\"https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/sociology/people/david-smilde\">scholar of Venezuela’s political process</a>, I know that is only part of the story. Machado is in many ways a controversial pick, less a peace activist than a political operator willing to use some of the trade’s dark arts for the greater democratic good.</p>\n\n<h2>Joining a controversial list of laureates</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, many <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/here-are-the-most-controversial-noble-prize-winners-ever.html\">Nobel Peace Prize awards generate controversy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It has often been bestowed on great politicians over activists. And sometimes the prize’s winners can have complex pasts and very non-peaceful resumes. </p>\n\n<p>Past recipients include Henry Kissinger, who as U.S. secretary of state and Richard Nixon’s security adviser was responsible for the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/henry-kissingers-bombing-campaign-likely-killed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cambodians-and-set-path-for-the-ravages-of-the-khmer-rouge-209353\">illegal bombing of Cambodia</a>, supporting Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/henry-kissinger-and-the-murder-of-timor-leste/\">brutal invasion of East Timor</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kissingers-obsession-with-chile-enabled-a-murderous-dictatorship-that-still-haunts-the-country-218982\">propping up dictators</a> in Latin America, among many other morally dubious actions. Similarly, former Palestinian Liberation Organization leader <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1994/summary/\">Yasser Arafat</a> and Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1978/begin/facts/\">Menachem Begin</a> were both awarded the prize, in 1994 and 1978 respectively, despite their past association with violent activities in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three men stand, two shaking hands.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Yitzhak Rabin – all Nobel Peace Prize laureates.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/yasser-arafat-henry-kissinger-and-yitzhak-rabin-at-unesco-news-photo/952432476?adppopup=true\">Duclos/Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Nobel Committee often seems to use these awards not to celebrate past achievements but to affect the future course of events. The nods to Begin and Arafat were, in this way, used for encouragement of the Middle East peace process. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, sometimes, the peace prize is seemingly bestowed as a sign of approval for a break from the past.</p>\n\n<p>Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/obama/facts/\">won his in 2009</a> despite only being nine months into his presidency. It was taken by many as a rejection of the previous presidency of George W. Bush, rather than recognition of Obama’s limited achievements at that time.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2016/santos/facts/\">Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos</a> was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just days after his peace plan was rejected in a referendum. In that instance, the committee seemed to want to give his efforts a push just after a major setback.</p>\n\n<h2>Democratic path or dark arts?</h2>\n\n<p>So what should be made of the Nobel Peace Prize committee’s decision to recognize opposition to Maduro now?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly Machado’s profile is ascendant. In her political career, she has participated in elections – winning a seat in the National Assembly in 2010 – but boycotted many more. She also boycotted negotiation processes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OxULhCJJEc\">suggesting instead that foreign intervention</a> was the only way to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023 she returned to the electoral path and steadfastly mobilized the Venezuelan population for opposition primaries and presidential elections, even after her <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/01/27/venezuela-s-supreme-court-disqualifies-opposition-leader-from-running-for-president_6469941_4.html\">candidacy was disqualified</a> by the government-controlled electoral authority, and innumerable other obstacles were put in her path. </p>\n\n<p>The campaign included spearheading caravans and events across the country at significant personal risk. </p>\n\n<p>However, much of her fight since then has been via less-democratic means.</p>\n\n<p>Machado has shunned local and regional elections suggesting there was no sense in participating until the government honored the results of the 2024 presidential election. She has also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-trump-support-maduro.html\">again sought international intervention</a> to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past year she has aggressively <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/05/us-intel-memo-undercuts-trump-claims-about-venezuelan-gang-00330542\">promoted the discredited theory</a> that Maduro is in control of the Tren de Aragua gang and is using it to invade the United States – a narrative <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/venezuela-and-us-edge-toward-war-footing-but-domestic-concerns-international-risks-may-hold-washington-back-266509\">gladly accepted and repurposed</a> by U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to being the expressed motivation for a U.S. military buildup off the coasts of Venezuela, this theory has also been the central justification cited by the Trump administration for using the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11269\">Alien Enemies Act</a> to deport, without due process, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">238 Venezuelan men to a horrific prison</a> in El Salvador.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A large painting of a man is held aloft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nicolas Maduro continues to loom large and rule Venezuela despite María Corina Machado’s efforts.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/pro-government-supporters-carry-a-drawing-of-president-of-news-photo/2229626580?adppopup=true\">Jesus Vargas/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Relations with Trump</h2>\n\n<p>The Nobel Peace Prize could help unify the Venezuelan opposition movement, which over the past year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/nx-s1-5389718/why-venezuelas-opposition-has-urged-voters-to-boycott-upcoming-regional-elections\">has begun to fray over differences in strategy</a>, especially with respect to Machado’s return to electoral boycotts. </p>\n\n<p>And it will certainly draw more international attention to Venezuelans’ struggle for democracy and could galvanize international stakeholders to push for change.</p>\n\n<p>What it will mean in terms of Trump’s relationship to Machado and Venezuela is yet to be seen. Her main connection with the administration is through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/nobel-trump-rubio-venezuela.html\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio</a>, who has aggressively represented her views and is pushing for U.S. military intervention to depose Maduro</p>\n\n<p>Awarding Machado the prize could strengthen Trump’s resolve to seek regime change in Venezuela. Or, if he feels snubbed by the Nobel committee after very vocally <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-would-have-been-an-unsuitable-choice-for-the-2025-nobel-peace-prize-but-he-may-be-a-more-serious-contender-in-2026-267067\">lobbying to be awarded</a> the peace prize himself, it could be a wedge between the U.S. president and Machado. </p>\n\n<p>Machado seems to understand this. After not mentioning him in her first statement after the award was announced, she has since mentioned him multiple times, even dedicating the prize to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5549522-trump-machado-nobel-peace-prize/\">both the Venezuelan people and Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/machado-congratulated-by-trump-dedicates-award-partly-to-him\">called to congratulate her</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A game changer? Perhaps not</h2>\n\n<p>To the degree that the Nobel Peace Prize is not just a model of change but a model for change, the decision to award it to Machado could conceivably affect the nature of Venezuela’s struggle against authoritarianism, leading her to continue to seek the restoration of democracy with a greater focus on reconciliation and coexistence among all Venezuelans, including the still politically relevant followers of the late Hugo Chávez.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the impact, it probably will not be game-changing. As we have seen with other winners, the initial glow of public recognition is quickly consumed by political conflict.</p>\n\n<p>And in Venezuela, there is no easy way to translate this prize into real democratic progress. </p>\n\n<p>While Machado and other Venezuelan democrats may have more support than ever among global democrats, Nicolás Maduro controls all of Venezuela’s institutions including the armed forces and the state oil company, which, even when sanctioned, provides substantial resources. Maduro also has forged <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/maduros-allies-who-backs-venezuelan-regime\">strategic alliances with China, Russia and Iran</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The only way one can imagine the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, with or without military action, is through an extensive process of negotiation, reconciliation, disarmament and justice that could lay the groundwork for coexistence. This Nobel Peace Prize could position Machado for this task.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267268/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Smilde does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Devoret</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/martinis/facts/\">John M. Martinis</a> – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven.</p>\n\n<p>The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the <a href=\"https://quantum2025.org/\">100th anniversary</a> of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/\">precision measurement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/summary/\">laser technology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1952/summary/\">medical imaging</a> and, probably the most far-reaching of all, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/summary/\">semiconductor electronic devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/summary/\">computer chips</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings.</p>\n\n<h2>The promises of quantum machines</h2>\n\n<p>Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2012/summary/\">photons and atomic ions</a>, that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions.

Distant objects can manifest <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/press-release/\">quantum entanglement</a> – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. </p>\n\n<p>The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality?</p>\n\n<h2>Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit</h2>\n\n<p>In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0829-5\">affirmative answer</a> to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1913/summary/\">superconductors</a>. Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/summary/\">Cooper pair</a>. These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls.</p>\n\n<p>To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/summary/\">Josephson junction</a>, which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1908\">quantum tunneling</a>, where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1543\">quantized, values</a>, which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications and outlooks</h2>\n\n<p>The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.69.80\">distinct quantum phenomena</a> – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting artificial atoms</a> has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812\">quantum computers</a> using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting quantum bit</a>, or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. The perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgMWommXxU8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">2025 Nobel laureate John Martinis discusses the roadmap of building a quantum computer at the 2016 Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference in Los Angeles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. The prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation. </p>\n\n<p>From those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. The combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation. </p>\n\n<p>This Nobel Prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266976/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Zhixin Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That has left market-watchers and monetary policymakers somewhat in the dark over key indicators in the U.S. economy.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers</a> is unaffected by the impasse in Washington and released its preliminary monthly report on Oct. 10, 2025; the final read of the month will be released in two weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. spoke with <a href=\"https://src.isr.umich.edu/research/faculty-profiles/profiles/joanne-hsu/\">Joanne Hsu</a>, the director of the Surveys of Consumers, on what the latest data shows about consumer sentiment – and whether the shutdown has left Americans feeling blue.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What is consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>Consumer sentiment is something that we at the University of Michigan have <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">measured since 1946</a>. It looks at American attitudes toward the current state of the economy and the future direction of the economy through questions on personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions for big-ticket items.</p>\n\n<p>Over the decades, it has been closely followed by policymakers, business leaders, academic researchers and investors as a leading indicator of the overall state of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>When sentiment is on the decline, consumers tend to pull back on spending – and that can lead to a slowdown in the economy. The opposite is also true: High or rising sentiment tends to lead to increased spending and a growing economy.</p>\n\n<h2>How is the survey compiled?</h2>\n\n<p>Every month, we interview a random sample of the U.S. population across the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Around 1,000 or so people take part in it every month, and we include a representative sample across ages, income, education level, demography and geography. People from across all walks of life are asked around 50 questions pertaining to the economy, personal finances, job prospects, inflation expectations and the like.</p>\n\n<p>When you aggregate that all together, it gives a useful measure of the health of the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<h2>What does the latest survey show?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">latest survey</a> shows virtually no change in overall sentiment between September and October. Consumers are not feeling that optimistic at the moment, but generally no worse than they were last month.</p>\n\n<p>Pocketbook issues – high prices of goods, inflation and possible weakening in the labor market – are suppressing sentiment. Views of consumers across the country converged earlier in the year when the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-sentiment-deteriorates-sharply-march-2025-03-14/\">Trump administration’s tariffs</a> were announced. But since then, higher-wealth and higher-income consumers have reported improved consumer sentiment. It is for lower-income Americans – those not owning stock – that sentiment hasn’t lifted since April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, we also saw a slight decline in inflation expectations, but it remains relatively high – midway between where they were around a year ago and the highs of around the time of the tariff announcements in April and May.</p>\n\n<h2>Has the government shutdown affected consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>The government shutdown was in place for around half the time of the latest survey period, which ran from Sept. 23-Oct. 6, 2025. And so far, we are not seeing evidence that it is impacting consumer sentiment one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>And that is not super-surprising. It is not that people don’t care about the shutdown, just that it hasn’t affected how they see the economy and their personal finances yet.</p>\n\n<p>History shows that federal shutdowns do move the needle a little. In 2019, around 10% of people spontaneously mentioned the then-shutdown in the January survey. We saw a <a href=\"https://sfa.senate.michigan.gov/Publications/EconInd/MEI_JAN19.pdf\">decline in sentiment</a> in that month, but it did improve again the following month.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, we tend to see stronger reaction to shutdowns when there is a debt ceiling crisis attached. In 2013, for example, there was a <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/11/shutdown-fears-drive-consumer-sentiment-to-9-month-low\">decline in consumer sentiment</a> coinciding with concerns over the debt ceiling being breached. But it did quickly rebound when the government opened again.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not we see a decline in sentiment because of the current shutdown depends on how long it lasts – and how consumers believe it will impact pocketbook issues, namely prices and job prospects.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267264/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanne Hsu receives research funding from NIA, NIH, and various sponsors of the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. </span></em></p>",

In 1858, a baby first named Hakadah, later called Ohíye S’a, who then became widely known as Charles Alexander Eastman for most of his adult life, was born near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. A Wahpeton Santee Dakota, he fled to Manitoba, Canada, with tribal members during <a href=\"https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/us-dakota-war\">the 1862 Dakota War</a> between the U.S. military and several bands of Dakota collectively known as the Santee Sioux.</p>\n\n<p>In December 1890, the two unexpectedly met each other while working at the <a href=\"https://history.sd.gov/archives/forms/indian%20archives/Indian%20Archives%20Project/pineridge.pdf?\">Pine Ridge Agency</a> in the newly declared state of South Dakota. Even more improbably, they fell in love. </p>\n\n<p>Just weeks later, booming Hotchkiss rifles 15 miles away signaled <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/native-american/disaster-at-wounded-knee/\">the start of the Wounded Knee Massacre</a>. Federal troops ended up killing at least 250 Lakota Sioux men, women and children; the traumatic event, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=a1fiNgoA_4cC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=wounded%20knee%20signaled&amp;f=false\">historian David Martínez writes</a>, sparked “the abrupt transformation of Indian nations from geopolitical powers … to symbols of conquest.”</p>\n\n<p>It also transformed Goodale and Eastman’s nascent relationship: They resolved to marry and to work together for Native American causes.</p>\n\n<p>Wounded Knee, however, would also prove an unfortunate metaphor for their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>In the research for my new dual biography, “<a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837915/love-and-loss-after-wounded-knee/\">Love and Loss After Wounded Knee: A Biography of an Extraordinary Interracial Marriage</a>,” I dove into letters, photographs and hundreds of newspaper articles documenting this high-profile, late-19th-century relationship. </p>\n\n<p>I came to understand that their marriage failed not only because of interpersonal tensions and a clash of values, but also because of some of the ways in which ideas about gender, race and Indigenous identity were rapidly changing in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>From writer to teacher</h2>\n\n<p>At 13, Goodale started publishing poetry in <a href=\"https://www.carnegielibrary.org/st-nicholas-magazine/\">St. Nicholas Magazine</a>, a popular children’s periodical. Her poems generated attention from the press, in addition to fan mail from notable men of letters, including <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/henry-wadsworth-longfellow\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. By the time she was 20, she had published five books. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of young woman.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Elaine Goodale Eastman in 1890, when she worked as the Supervisor of Education for the Dakotas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">South Dakota Historical Society</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But because poets without family fortunes needed other means to support themselves – and because women in the late 1800s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/hwj/23.1.59\">had few career options</a> – Goodale turned to teaching. She accepted a job at Virginia’s <a href=\"https://home.hamptonu.edu/about/history/\">Hampton Institute</a>, a boarding school that was founded to teach newly emancipated Black students. It later became part of the government’s program to assimilate Native Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Goodale became convinced that Indigenous children would benefit more from schools in their own communities, rather than at government- or church-run boarding schools. She traveled to <a href=\"https://www.history.nd.gov/archives/stateagencies/dtrecords.html\">the Dakota Territory</a> and opened a day school. She also turned from poetry to prose, documenting her observations of “Indian life and education” in dozens of articles. </p>\n\n<p>By the time she came to Pine Ridge Agency, the administrative offices at the Oglala Lakota Indian Reservation, she had been appointed the first supervisor of education for the Dakotas.</p>\n\n<h2>The ideal ‘assimilated Indian’</h2>\n\n<p>Ohíye S’a’s early years were marked by family trauma and U.S. government policies aimed at seizing land and displacing and assimilating Native people. His mother died shortly after he was born, and during the Dakota War it was widely believed that his father and brothers had perished.

He was convinced that only a formal English-language education could provide a path forward for Native people.</p>\n\n<p>At his father’s urging, Ohíye S’a became “Charles Eastman,” and he also converted to Christianity. He attended a series of boarding schools before <a href=\"https://archive.dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/article/1984/10/1/ohiyesa-a-winner-lost-is-found\">landing at Dartmouth College</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/if_you_knew/ifyouknew_11.html\">Boston University Medical School</a>. </p>\n\n<p>His white mentors saw Eastman – the only Native person in his class at either institution – as the ideal “assimilated Indian.” His achievements often appeared in newspapers with headlines like “He’s a Winner: Sioux Indian Who Got a Boston University Degree,” an allusion to the fact that “Ohíye S’a” translated to “winner.”</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t clear whether Eastman ever thought of himself in that way. But throughout his life, he straddled the world in which he was raised and the one in which he was educated. His first job, as agency physician at Pine Ridge, placed him at the nexus of these two cultures.</p>\n\n<h2>An unlikely pair, a media sensation</h2>\n\n<p>After the shots rang out near Wounded Knee Creek, Eastman’s medical education was put to the test. Called into service as a nurse, Goodale also tended the wounded and dying in the makeshift hospital at a nearby church. </p>\n\n<p>Six months later, Elaine and Charles were married in New York City in June 1891, much to the consternation of her family.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white photo of soldiers standing around a ditch filled with corpses\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A mass grave for Native Americans killed during the Wounded Knee Massacre.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/massengrab-f%C3%BCr-die-indianer-nach-derschlacht-am-wounded-news-photo/542360409?adppopup=true\">Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The couple’s nuptials appeared in hundreds of newspapers, partially due to the rarity of an interracial marriage in the 19th century. Much of the coverage <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837915/love-and-loss-after-wounded-knee/\">was rife with racist stereotypes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Watertown Times in New York proclaimed, “Poetess Marries a Big Injun’”; the San Francisco Examiner ran a front-page story declaring “Fair Bride of An Indian: Elaine Goodale Weds the Red Man of Her Choice.” </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, articles focused on Charles’ educational background, often misrepresenting it by suggesting he had attended Cornell, Harvard or Yale. He was referred to as a “specimen,” with racialized language discussing his physical attributes: “He is of medium height … with all the peculiarities of his people in his features. His eyes are small and glittering, his face and nose are broad and his cheek bones very pronounced,” according to the San Francisco Examiner.</p>\n\n<p>This type of media coverage – highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles’ backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways – would dog them throughout their marriage.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional travails, personal problems</h2>\n\n<p>Charles attempted to set up his own medical practice in St. Paul, Minnesota. But white patients proved reluctant to see “an Indian doctor,” while Native patients were hesitant to patronize a physician dispensing unfamiliar medicines. The practice failed.</p>\n\n<p>Financial pressures increased over the next decade as Elaine and Charles became parents of six children. They moved frequently: Charles took on a series of jobs, including recruiting for the YMCA, lobbying on behalf of the Santee Sioux, and working as an “outing agent” at <a href=\"https://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu/\">the Carlisle Indian Industrial School</a>, which involved finding summer placements for Native students with white families in a further attempt to Americanize them. </p>\n\n<p>Because Charles left behind few personal papers, it’s difficult to know if he believed in this program. But it’s easy to see how it could have created an identity crisis of sorts. </p>\n\n<p>At other points in his life, Charles seemed to put his Dakota identity front and center. For example, he was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians, an organization that worked on behalf of self-determination for Native Americans. He even served as its president in 1918. Meanwhile, his wife remained a staunch believer in assimilation.</p>\n\n<p>At Elaine’s urging – and likely, under her editorial stewardship – Charles began publishing stories and then books about his “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/337/337-h/337-h.htm\">Indian Boyhood</a>.” While Elaine continued writing and was able to publish a few books, his literary career took off and hers stalled out.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Cursive text.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A signature from a copy of one of Charles Eastman’s books, in which he uses both his Christian name and his Native American name, Ohíye S’a.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Charles_Eastman_Signature.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even their children weren’t spared from the headlines.

Other times he posed <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Charles_Eastman_(Ohiyesa).jpg\">in traditional Sioux regalia</a>. Often the coverage of his talks focused more on what he was wearing than the content of his lecture. Historian <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/kvigil\">Kiara Vigil</a> suggests that Charles knew that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=G03zCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=eastman#v=snippet&amp;q=eastman&amp;f=false\">his dress functioned as an advertisement for his work</a>, arguing that his choice of attire was strategic: “Eastman’s ability to dress up as an Indian, or not, enabled him to address diverse audiences and their expectations.”</p>\n\n<p>He was away from home more than he was present, further fueling Elaine’s resentment. In personal letters, she described her bitterness at Charles leaving the children and household to her sole care, and her belief that he was reinforcing the gender roles she’d railed against. While she certainly understood that his posing in buckskin and feathered headdress was good marketing, she probably never realized what reclaiming his Indigenous identity meant to Charles; she, too, thought of him as the product of successful assimilation.</p>\n\n<h2>It all falls apart</h2>\n\n<p>The personal and professional pressures on the Eastmans continued through the early years of the 20th century. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">They reached a breaking point after their second daughter</a>, Irene Taluta, died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. The tragic loss of a beloved child continued to unravel an already frayed marriage. </p>\n\n<p>Elaine and Charles separated in 1921, though they never formally divorced.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been interested in the Eastmans and their unlikely marriage since I first learned of it years ago.

The stereotype of Latter-day Saints as mostly white, conservative Americans is just one of many <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-michigan-church-shooting-sits-within-a-long-history-of-hatred-against-mormons-in-america-266481\">long-standing misconceptions</a> about LDS communities and beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Many people are surprised to learn there are vibrant congregations far from the American West’s “<a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-is-the-mormon-corridor.html\">Mormon Corridor</a>.” There are devout Latter-day Saints everywhere from <a href=\"https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/from-freeze-to-fire\">Ghana</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20221212-uae-mormons-to-have-first-temple-in-the-middle-east/\">United Arab Emirates</a> to <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/02/26/russian-mormons-search-for-identity-and-acceptance-in-an-american-church-a64574\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2025/07/04/lds-branches-shut-down-beijing/\">mainland China</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Global growth</h2>\n\n<p>Joseph Smith founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830 and immediately <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church\">sent missionaries</a> to preach along the frontier. The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after World War II, church leaders <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-forty-two?lang=eng\">overhauled their missionary approach</a> to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52616-0_4\">growth across the globe</a>, especially in <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8900/\">Central America</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5406/dialjmormthou.46.3.0045\">South America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724233515?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses\">Pacific Islands</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today, the church has over <a href=\"https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics\">17.5 million members</a>, according to church records. A majority <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/facts-statistics?lang=eng\">live outside the U.S.</a>, spread across <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/01/news-of-the-church/church-growing-in-more-than-160-countries?lang=eng\">more than 160 countries</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One way the church and researchers track this global growth is <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/members/2024/06/08/charts-growth-church-jesus-christ-latter-day-saints-1830-2023-member-temples-wards-stakes/\">by construction of new temples</a>.These buildings, used not for weekly worship but <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/temples\">special ceremonies</a> like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist <a href=\"https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/locations/\">in dozens of countries</a>, from Argentina to Tonga.</p>\n\n<p>During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2025/04/10/by-the-numbers-look-200-temples-announced-president-nelson-7-years/\">200 new temples</a>, more than any of his predecessors.

These <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#eligibility\">are colleges</a> where at least 25% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic or Latino.</p>\n\n<p>This is more than a legal technicality. It reflects the Justice Department’s position that HSI grants violate constitutional protections, putting millions of federal dollars for these schools at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Citing this legal rationale, the Department of Education confirmed in September that it had frozen <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">US$350 million in education grants</a> intended for <a href=\"https://cmsi.gse.rutgers.edu/content/what-are-msis\">Minority-Serving Institutions</a>. This includes more than $250 million for HSIs, specifically.</p>\n\n<p>The Education Department argues that these programs amount to racial discrimination because they tie <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">federal grants</a> to students’ racial or ethnic backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>This echoes <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">the Supreme Court’s decision</a> in 2023, which narrowed how colleges can consider race and ethnicity in admissions.</p>\n\n<p>I serve as the university diversity officer at California State University, Chico, an HSI.

This amendment authorizes federal grants to help strengthen colleges that enroll large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students, providing more opportunity for those students to succeed and graduate. </p>\n\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/research/publications/hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis\">600 federally designated HSIs</a> across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. California is home to the most HSIs, with 167, followed by Texas, Puerto Rico, New York and Illinois. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to showing that at least 25% of its student population is Hispanic or Latino, any college or university that wants to qualify as an HSI must also show that at least half of its students come from <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ope/idues/eligibility-infographic.pdf\">low-income backgrounds</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an HSI allows colleges and universities to apply for federal funding intended to support underrepresented and low-income students.</p>\n\n<h2>HSIs vary in size and mission</h2>\n\n<p>HSIs enroll over <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/newsroom/over-600-colleges-and-universities-are-now-hispanic-serving-institutions,-enrolling-nearly-one-third-of-all-undergraduates\">1.5 million Hispanic students</a>, which amounts to over 60% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>This marks a big increase from the 340,000 Hispanic undergraduates who attended an HSI in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these schools are large public research universities, such as University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Santa Cruz. Others are regional institutions, private colleges and local community colleges. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, another kind of Hispanic-Serving Institution has emerged – research-intensive HSIs. These are colleges and universities where at least 25% of the student body is Hispanic and where there is significant research funding and a range of doctoral programs offered. These schools include University of California, Irvine; Florida International University; and the University of Texas at El Paso, <a href=\"https://www.hsru.org/\">among others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers <a href=\"https://www.equityinhighered.org/resources/ideas-and-insights/defining-servingness-at-hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis-practical-implications-for-hsi-leaders/\">have debated</a> whether the HSI category has become too broad, grouping schools with vastly different resources, missions and student populations. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their differences, <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12027/becoming-hispanic-serving-institutions?srsltid=AfmBOooRB0hS5b9YieGd3ENAMJwdlOQ2QzVxmCewbFgDjykctW1KBLgH\">many HSIs</a> enroll large numbers of first-generation, low-income and working students, as well as immigrants and transfer students. </p>\n\n<p>HSIs also generally operate with fewer financial and academic resources than comparable non-HSI institutions.</p>\n\n<h2>How HSI funding works</h2>\n\n<p>Title V grants from the Department of Education are one clear way that <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v\">HSIs can receive federal funding </a>. </p>\n\n<p>These competitive grants are intended to help HSIs expand educational opportunities and institutional capacity to support Hispanic and low-income students.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than providing aid directly to students, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#past-awards\">Title V grants</a> are used to offer faculty training, update classrooms and laboratories, create new degree programs and develop mentorship opportunities for first-generation students.</p>\n\n<p>At campuses such as California State University, Chico and University of California, Irvine, Title V grants have given schools the money to create bilingual advising services and maintain data systems.</p>\n\n<p>Title V grants form only one part of the <a href=\"https://hacu.net/advocacy/hsi-funding/\">broader funding picture for HSIs</a>. Like many colleges, HSIs rely on state funding and tuition revenue.

Hispanic students at these schools, which include Arizona State University and California State University, Fullerton, graduate at rates roughly 8 percentage points higher than Hispanic students nationally. </p>\n\n<p>Hispanic students at HSIs graduate at rates more than 5 percentage points higher than those at comparable non-HSI colleges, according to <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Latino_Success_Report_Final_HR.pdf\">similar 2017 findings</a> from the nonprofit Education Trust. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12712/transforming-hispanic-serving-institutions-equity-and-justice?srsltid=AfmBOopX2-psJ79B5ryNHaalD0B1Ea3lFXTZN9pplW3C6SzPwYLTHUxp\">There are a few reasons why</a> there is a relatively high graduation rate for Hispanic students at HSIs. </p>\n\n<p>Students at HSIs often report feeling a strong sense of belonging and see their own cultures reflected in the curriculum. Many HSI campuses also offer dedicated programs for first-generation students and train faculty to teach and advise with equity and inclusion in mind.</p>\n\n<p>At University of California, Irvine, where I helped lead HSI initiatives, Hispanic undergraduate enrollment grew by <a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/jan22/a5attach1.pdf\">nearly 150%</a> between 2009 and 2019, from 3,000 students to more than 7,500. </p>\n\n<p>During that time, more than 350 faculty and staff completed <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:f9a482a5-a48c-4425-9e7d-3e29c862f1af\">equity-focused training</a> to strengthen advising and teaching practices that support Hispanic and other underrepresented students.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People hold umbrellas and walk together in the rain near palm trees, in front of a large sign that days Fullerton\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Visitors to California State University, Fullerton take a guided campus tour.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/fullerton-ca-visitors-to-cal-state-fullerton-are-on-a-news-photo/1250864058?adppopup=true\">Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What’s at stake for HSIs</h2>\n\n<p>Hispanic Americans now make up nearly <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2024/hispanic-heritage-month.html#:%7E:text=Did%20You%20Know?,Vintage%202023%20Population%20Estimates\">20% of the U.S. population</a>, and their college enrollment numbers are <a href=\"https://excelenciaineducation.medium.com/americas-economic-future-latinos-and-the-institutions-that-serve-them-cfdc13f4f03e\">projected to grow</a> from about 3.7 million in 2020 to 4.5 million by 2030, as overall college enrollment numbers are projected to decline during this time.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED571544.pdf\">national evaluation</a> of Title V projects found that most colleges and universities used these grants to improve student services, develop new academic programs and build community partnerships that help first-generation and low-income students stay enrolled and complete their degrees.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654319864591\">HSI researchers</a> note, graduation rates tell only part of the story.

In the United States, acts of private political violence <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/rising-threat-anti-government-domestic-terrorism-what-data-tells-us\">against members of government</a> and <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/which-groups-have-experienced-an-increase-in-hate-crimes/\">against ordinary people</a> have both increased dramatically in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Political assassinations are the most vivid form of political violence. The Kirk assassination is only the latest example. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An attendee wears a gun on their hip during a candlelight vigil and prayer event at which an American flag is displayed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An attendee at a candlelight vigil and prayer event for assassinated Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025, in Seattle.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-attendee-wears-a-gun-on-their-hip-during-a-candlelight-news-photo/2234136824?adppopup=true\">David Ryder/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In June 2025, a shooter with a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5353959-minnesota-suspects-hit-list-house-members-state-lawmakers/\">hit list” of left-liberal targets</a> assassinated Minnesota Democratic Rep.

In December 2024, a shooter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/us/luigi-mangione-diary-entries-murder-case\">angry about health insurance costs</a> killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In July 2024, a shooter <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-vp-vance-rubio-7c7ba6b99b5f38d2d840ed95b2fdc3e5\">wounded Trump at a campaign rally</a> in a failed assassination attempt.</p>\n\n<p>Political violence also includes bias-motivated murders. In 2022, a white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/buffalo-supermarket-gunman-to-be-sentenced-to-life-for-racist-attack-killing-10\">murdered 10 Black patrons</a> at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. In 2019, an anti-immigrant racist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/07/texas-walmart-gunman-90-life-sentences-2019\">murdered 23 mostly Latino shoppers</a> at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Texas. In 2018, an antisemite <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html\">murdered 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In those incidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/23/us-mass-killings-extremism-anti-defamation-league\">and numerous others</a>, extreme political ideas appear to have motivated the attackers. The linkage of extremist speech to lethal violence has prompted calls to legally <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol31/iss1/4\">restrict or punish extremist speech</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Political violence, free speech and cultural editing</h2>\n\n<p>The First Amendment, however, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/\">protects extremist speech</a>, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/886/\">including advocacy of violence</a>. Violent rhetoric must <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/\">actually incite</a> or <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/22-138/\">threaten violence</a> to lose the First Amendment’s shelter.</p>\n\n<p>If law cannot curb the sorts of speech that may inspire political violence, what about social norms – widely shared beliefs about what speech is socially acceptable or appropriate?</p>\n\n<p>Much speech that the First Amendment protects from government regulation eventually disappears from public discourse. That happens through a process I call “cultural editing”: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2024.101974\">popular and institutional rejection of outmoded or repellent ideas</a>. For example, no serious medical conference discusses <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2022/04/10-strange-medical-practices-from-history/\">treating hay fever with cocaine</a>, and no respectable political science panel includes Nazis.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yCu21pL73s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=118\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a social media post after Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Donald Trump blamed ‘radical left’ rhetoric for political violence.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s blaming of the Kirk assassination on “radical left” rhetoric points toward a deeper level of cultural editing. </p>\n\n<p>Trump and other conservatives have not cited speech that advocated violence against Kirk. Instead, some conservative activists, spurred on by Trump administration officials, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/jd-vance-doxing-charlie-kirk-critics\">called for harassing and punishing critics</a> of Kirk’s statements and actions. </p>\n\n<p>But such criticisms of Kirk, whatever their merits or lack thereof, fall within the scope of ordinary political debate.  </p>\n\n<p>Kirk was not a government official, but he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/charlie-kirk-republicans-trump-politics.html\">strong influence in the Trump administration</a>. Robust democratic discourse <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/\">requires space for people to criticize</a> such powerful figures. Large-scale cultural editing of those criticisms, amounting to suppression of left-leaning views, would hurt the public’s ability to discuss and resolve political disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>However, Trump and others who push for suppressing harsh political rhetoric might argue that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-believe-harsh-political-rhetoric-is-fueling-violence-reutersipsos-poll-2025-09-16/\">the stakes of verbal attacks have increased</a>. They might say that U.S. political culture can no longer indulge political invective because political violence has become more common. </p>\n\n<h2>Political violence and guns</h2>\n\n<p>That argument for suppressing harsh political speech ignores an independent cause of political violence: gun proliferation.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/report/the-role-of-guns-in-rising-political-violence/\">Most political violence in the U.S. involves guns</a>. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/11/Charlie-Kirk-Trump-political-violence-guns/\">Guns make political violence easier</a> by erasing the distance between extremist ideas and lethal action. Hate or fanaticism can end a life in an instant, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/09/11/how-the-shooting-of-charlie-kirk-unfolded/\">hundreds of yards from the victim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has by far <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-ownership-by-country\">the highest number of civilian guns and rate of civilian gun ownership</a> in the world. Since 2008, when <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/\">the Supreme Court declared</a> an individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, annual U.S. gun purchases have increased <a href=\"https://americangunfacts.com/gun-ownership-statistics/\">from about 9 million</a> to <a href=\"https://www.safehome.org/data/firearms-guns-statistics/\">about 16 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Governments often find <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/564/786/\">regulating speech easier</a>, even though less effective, than tackling underlying problems. At times, federal and state governments have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/467528\">addressed political violence by regulating guns</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750656174/the-u-s-once-had-a-ban-on-assault-weapons-why-did-it-expire\">1994 federal assault weapons ban</a> exemplifies regulatory efforts to curb overall gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>But the Supreme Court’s Second Amendment cases <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/\">now appear to bar strong gun regulations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People in a democratic society need freedom to make harsh, even extreme political statements with a minimum of cultural editing. The Second Amendment protects access to lethal weapons. This combination of free speech and gun rights makes the growing problem of political violence much harder to solve.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265223/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gregory P.

You can imagine them as an atomic-scale scaffold filled with nano-sized rooms, each precisely engineered to host certain molecules like guests. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, such as MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity that can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Because chemists can mix and match different metals and organic linkers, there are thousands of possible MOFs – each with unique properties.

MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules.</p>\n\n<p>These features have already inspired potential uses such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">capturing carbon dioxide from the air</a> to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">pulling clean water</a> from humid air, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D4RA04441J\">delivering medicines inside the body</a>. Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr200324t\">for sensing and detection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Atq5z5AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">our team</a> <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/rex-gerald/\">of engineers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz8jKuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">has been developing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iYkrD9IAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN\">MOF-based sensors</a> that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>From a storage material to a sensing material</h2>\n\n<p>When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-chemistryprize2025-1.pdf\">tiny framework changes</a> ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. </p>\n\n<p>By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output.</p>\n\n<p>Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. </p>\n\n<p>This crystal-fiber combination worked as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19775\">a tiny device</a> that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3094092\">picked up these changes</a>, allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. </p>\n\n<p>Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification.</p>\n\n<p>In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371551\">diabetic ketoacidosis</a>, allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695515/original/file-20251009-56-jqsqqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A photo showing a tube-like device, and a person exhaling into it out of their nose.

Ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers.</p>\n\n<p>Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.5c00982\">we developed</a> a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.128608\">allowing it to detect gases</a> with remarkable sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity.</p>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal.</p>\n\n<p>These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors.</p>\n\n<h2>Toward real-world impact</h2>\n\n<p>The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100348\">degrade under humidity or heat</a>, though some research groups are looking into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">how to make them more stable</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b00937\">human breath monitoring</a>, where subtle changes in exhaled gases <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177518\">provide early clues</a> to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers are working to embed MOFs into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">flexible films</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-022-2226-6\">printed circuits and wireless devices</a>. With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale.</p>\n\n<p>If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267103/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jie Huang receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rex Gerald receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bohong Zhang and Chen Zhu do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n\n<p>In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship.</p>\n\n<p>But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBPxHqkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8abR970AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and</a> our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom.</p>\n\n<p>Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"three men drink wine at cafe table with bill on it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/three-men-look-at-a-bill-in-a-cafe-and-divide-royalty-free-image/1312208692\">tim scott/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A focus on what friends give you</h2>\n\n<p>The traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_3\">social exchange theory of friendship</a> views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2008.00499.x\">what kinds of friendships to pursue</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2017.0737\">how to treat your friends</a>. It’s even <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/blog/social-exchange-theory\">made its way into pop psychology</a> self-help spaces.</p>\n\n<p>We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. </p>\n\n<h2>Less accounting, more supporting</h2>\n\n<p>Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216308098798\">likely to support their friends</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075241243341\">what they want in a friend</a>, they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective.</p>\n\n<p>People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met.</p>\n\n<p>Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2023.112120\">ranked higher in importance</a> than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, friendship <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015227414929\">isn’t always positive</a>. Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. </p>\n\n<h2>Friendship is more than the sum of its parts</h2>\n\n<p>But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of <a href=\"https://www.humangenerosity.org/\">The Human Generosity Project</a>, a cross-disciplinary research collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15800-2_4\">across societies</a>, from “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/646235\">kere kere” in Fiji</a> to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.22\">tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda</a>.

People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able.</p>\n\n<p>These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals.</p>\n\n<p>When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">environments are volatile</a> and when they ask those most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.12.003\">likely to be able to help</a>. These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">keeping track of debts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events.</p>\n\n<p>And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges</a> such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">this same pattern</a> in an online study of U.S.-based participants.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">branding cattle</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">paying bills</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat</h2>\n\n<p>What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange.</p>\n\n<p>What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258549/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Athena Aktipis receives funding from the National Science Foundation.

People with too few or defective Treg cells <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12170\">often develop autoimmune diseases</a>, where unchecked immune cells mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues or organs. Yet when Treg cells become too numerous, people can become <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14069\">more susceptible to cancer</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-387827-4.00003-6\">and infections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, Treg cells are often described as a double-edged sword. Treg cells also control internal revolt in the form of an overactive immune response by other immune cells that can trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772\">arthritis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789\">lupus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269\">multiple sclerosis</a> – diseases that develop when Treg cells are defective in either number, function or both.  </p>\n\n<p>The well-established functions of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections have recently been complemented by research unraveling how environmental factors influence these cells and modulate the immune response.</p>\n\n<p>We are a husband-wife team of immunologists who study how environmental factors such as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jJVj3sUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">chemicals, diet and gut bacteria</a> affect Treg cells and the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=af7TahQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">overall functioning of the immune system</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While our study dating back to 1984 found that certain environmental contaminants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008X(84)90261-8\">induce T cells that suppress the immune system</a>, further study on such cells was hampered by an inability in the field at large to isolate and characterize these cells. The discoveries honored by this year’s Nobel Prize transformed how researchers understand the immune system. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Nobel-Prizing winning scientist showing extreme emotion.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One of the three Nobel Prize-winning researchers, Mary E.

Some examples of environmental factors include chemical pollutants found in the air and water, microbes, sunlight, diet and medications.   </p>\n\n<p>Rather than being a single, static population, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02716\">Treg cells are highly adaptable</a>. They integrate a variety of environmental cues to either suppress or manage immune responses. They accomplish this by producing key molecules such as FoxP3 that send a signal to other immune cells to stop mounting an aggressive immune response.   </p>\n\n<p>Certain toxic chemicals can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21217849\">increase the number or activity of Treg cells</a>. One of the best-known examples is a group of long-lasting pollutants <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/dioxins\">called dioxins</a> that accumulate in fatty tissues through <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health\">consumption of contaminated meat, dairy and fish</a>. They are produced from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-36903-7_1\">burning waste</a> as well as chemical manufacturing and forest fires.  </p>\n\n<p>The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590813/#\">is a known human carcinogen</a>. Researchers have linked exposure to this chemical to various health problems, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304426\">including cancer</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2016.07.007\">reproductive and developmental issues</a>. Research shows that dioxins <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2008.63\">activate Treg cells</a> through a sensor known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1421346\">aryl hydrocarbon receptor</a>. This constitutes one of the mechanisms through which certain environmental chemicals promote cancer by enhancing Treg activity and suppressing the anti-cancer immune response.  </p>\n\n<p>Air pollution, such as diesel exhaust, can have the opposite effect, impairing Treg cell function and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.08.008\">contributing to inflammatory diseases such as asthma</a>.

Compounds known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-023-03031-4\">indoles, found in vegetables from the cabbage family</a> such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1501727\">can activate Treg cells and help prevent gut inflammation</a>. These compounds also work by stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which boosts Treg numbers and activity. </p>\n\n<p>Another way diet can influence Treg cells is through the regulation of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hangry-bacteria-in-your-gut-microbiome-are-linked-to-chronic-disease-feeding-them-what-they-need-could-lead-to-happier-cells-and-a-healthier-body-199486\">the microbes that live in the gut</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms16047493\">gut has trillions of microbial residents, both benefical and harmful</a>. Previous research found that Treg cells in the gut <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.600973\">play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis</a> – the dynamic balance between microbiota and immune cells found in the gut. Any disturbance leading to loss of Treg cell function can lead to hyperactivation of other immune cells in the gut. This can trigger <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">inflammation</a> in which the immune cells destroy the lining of the intestine, leading to conditions such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8813558\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other naturally occurring substances – such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02267\">naringenin</a>, a chemical abundant in citrus fruits, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2011.04.009\">epigallocatechin-3-gallate</a>, a compound found in green tea – also activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote Treg development.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fiber-is-your-bodys-natural-guide-to-weight-management-rather-than-cutting-carbs-out-of-your-diet-eat-them-in-their-original-fiber-packaging-instead-205159\">fiber-rich diet</a> supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This bacteria ferments fiber into <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-019-00057-5#\">short-chain fatty acids that enhance Treg cell function</a> and help maintain gut health. Probiotic bacteria also increases Treg cell populations, thereby reducing inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, dietary tryptophan – an amino acid found in foods such as poultry, eggs, tofu and seeds – is metabolized into compounds that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092846\">activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor</a>, further boosting Treg cell activity and protecting against gut inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, a Western diet high in fat, sugar and processed foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2024.101923\">disrupts the balance of gut bacteria</a>. This, in turn, reduces the population of microbes that support Treg cells and promotes a more inflammatory environment in the gut.</p>\n\n<h2>Keeping Treg cells in harmony</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists like us and many others are working to understand the processes involved in maintaining the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06880\">delicate balance of Treg cells</a> that are influenced by all of these outside factors. The goal is to learn how Treg cells and other immune cells can be kept in equilibrium – strong enough to defend against infections and cancer yet restrained enough to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. </p>\n\n<p>The profound environmental influence on Treg cell development and function makes understanding these interactions crucial for defining the fine line between health and disease.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266865/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Prakash Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.  </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mitzi Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p>",

Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death.</p>\n\n<p>While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What to expect this flu season</h2>\n\n<p>Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see <a href=\"https://www.idse.net/Influenza/Article/10-25/CDC-Classifies-Upcoming-Flu-Season-as-Moderate-but-Vaccination-Still-Key/78478\">a moderate level of flu cases</a>, partly because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.17484\">last year’s flu activity was high</a> and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. </p>\n\n<p>However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been <a href=\"https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/worrying-signs-as-peak-flu-season-draws-near\">more severe than in years past</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm\">children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. <a href=\"https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/articles/antigenic-drift-vs-antigenic-shift-311044\">Because flu viruses mutate frequently</a>, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/influenza-inactivated.html\">best protection against severe illness</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">will be trivalent</a> – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A family, mom, dad and two young children all sit in bed together blowing their noses.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/sick-flu-and-family-on-a-bed-tissue-and-blowing-royalty-free-image/1575862747\">Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Vaccine availability</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-will-approve-covid-19-vaccine-only-for-older-adults-and-high-risk-groups-a-public-health-expert-explains-the-new-rules-257226\">Recent vaccine policy changes</a> have created some confusion, particularly around <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-with-new-restrictions-potentially-limiting-access-for-healthy-children-264098\">COVID-19 vaccines</a>. Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost.</p>\n\n<p>The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu-vaccination/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot-this-year\">cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor</a> for the flu by about half.</p>\n\n<p>Vaccination helps <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.004\">reduce the severity of illness</a>, the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html\">at the same time as other vaccines</a>, such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status.</p>\n\n<h2>Who should get the flu shot</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html\">everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year</a>, with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073620\">the American Association of Pediatrics</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The flu vaccine is especially important for:</p>\n\n<p>• Adults 65 and older</p>\n\n<p>• Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2</p>\n\n<p>• Pregnant people</p>\n\n<p>• People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease</p>\n\n<p>• Health care workers and caregivers</p>\n\n<p>Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated <a href=\"https://www.renown.org/blog/slow-the-spread-of-the-flu-with-herd-immunity\">protects not only you but also those around you</a> who may be more vulnerable.</p>\n\n<h2>Practical prevention tips</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses:</p>\n\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.nfid.org/washyourhands-to-help-prevent-disease/\">Wash your hands frequently</a> with soap and water. </p>\n\n<p>• Cover your coughs and sneezes.</p>\n\n<p>• Stay home if you’re feeling unwell.</p>\n\n<p>• Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough.</p>\n\n<p>Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-should-you-get-the-new-covid-19-booster-and-the-flu-shot-now-is-the-right-time-for-both-190826\">getting vaccinated</a> and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy.  </p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html\">now’s the time</a> to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267058/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Libby Richards has received funding from the American Nurses Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute . </span></em></p>",

I have written a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83078-6\">textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders</a>, and, more recently, a self-help book for <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooBA1XtZ9Uea0tv2baj9t8v7TXnaPW7WBf21RqvKUM-imc32kzO\">people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019\">food addiction is a real phenomenon</a>. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70338\">certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed</a> – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes25053\">affect the brains and behavior</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83116-0\">of certain people</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112574\">similarly to other addictive substances</a> such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">nicotine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction.</p>\n\n<h2>How does addiction work?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597351/\">neurobiological mechanisms of addiction</a> have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.010\">preexisting genetic</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000870\">environmental factors</a> set the stage for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00034-y\">developing an addiction</a>. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">important brain systems</a>, leading the person to crave more and more of it.</p>\n\n<p>This rewiring takes place in <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOopjx6BZgKuKhvAdGDFBjZPHVbZiJSDRThQXyEsSsw4nYc1i8iV7\">three key brain networks</a> that correspond to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">key functional domains</a>, often referred to as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.011\">reward system</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.038\">the stress response system</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2013-0054\">the system in charge of executive control</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine\">called dopamine</a> in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0191-4\">neurobiological process called conditioning</a>, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00264\">increasing influence over decision-making and behavior</a>, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. </p>\n\n<p>Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience <a href=\"https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments\">symptoms of withdrawal</a>, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. </p>\n\n<p>At that point, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_288\">negative reinforcement kicks in</a>. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief.</p>\n\n<p>Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex\">prefrontal cortex</a>, and other key parts of the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010654108\">involved in impulse control and self-regulation</a>. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZ5LH634W8s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What evidence is there that food is addictive?</h2>\n\n<p>Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22639\">high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods</a> – often foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762\">that are ultraprocessed</a> – act on these brain networks in ways that are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/foods-high-in-added-fats-and-refined-carbs-are-like-cigarettes-addictive-and-unhealthy-165441\">similar to other addictive substances</a>. The resulting changes in the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008\">fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance</a> – in this case, highly rewarding food.</p>\n\n<p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">hallmark signs of a substance use disorder</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.071\">predicts weight gain</a>.

But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, eating disorders such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615\">bulimia nervosa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627\">binge-eating disorder</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00411-0\">often occur alongside addictive eating</a>. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">excessive dietary restriction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A way forward</h2>\n\n<p>But others argue that, with care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16132019\">integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment</a> is feasible and could be lifesaving for some.</p>\n\n<p>The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-024-01017-9\">consider food addiction in their treatment models</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One such approach might look like <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooIfW4_BgKGysr2y90Cts7qyqjoKdpF5HIxXAiNMPY7rRHDYKI3\">the one described to me</a> by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Additional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1556988\">clinical studies</a> are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2024.107211\">already being carried out</a>. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1542905\">are underway</a> by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1159/000527322\">into future editions of diagnostic manuals</a> such as the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases\">World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261727/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have two books for sale which address food addiction, and I could benefit financially from increased interest in the food addiction topic:\n\nWilcox C.E.

And the reality on the ground suggests that the two countries are still far from sealing any deal to end the Israeli military incursions into Syrian territory that have occurred since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024. Just days after the American official gave his prognosis and as negotiations continued, Israel <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/28/middleeast/israel-syria-normalization-strikes-intl\">struck several Syrian targets</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Citing negotiation sources, several news outlets reported that the delay in securing a deal was primarily related to Israel’s 11th-hour demand of creating a so-called <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-09-28/ty-article/.premium/israel-seeks-humanitarian-corridor-of-influence-in-syria-threatening-regime-stability/00000199-8cf4-dbe0-af9d-9ef5d6a00000\">humanitarian corridor</a> that would link the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israeli-occupied Golan Heights</a> to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-druze-are-a-tightly-knit-community-and-the-violence-in-syria-is-triggering-fears-in-lebanon-261931\">Sweidah, a city in southern Syria</a>. Israel said the purpose is to protect religious minorities in the Golan Heights and Sweidah. </p>\n\n<p>The hitch, after months of U.S.-mediated talks, reflects Syria’s vulnerability in these negotiations. Seeking to move on after year of war, the current Syrian leadership is eager to snuff out remaining internal violence, secure the borders and return to the United Nations-brokered truce with Israel that had been in place for decades. However, concluding a deal with its militarily superior neighbor risks the further fragmentation of Syria and an entrenched violation of its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, as an <a href=\"https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=rebeizm\">expert on the Middle East</a>, I believe the talks and the potential last-minute snag point to Israel believing it has the upper hand. Meanwhile for Syria, a desire for security can’t mask what it sees as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria-israelpalestine/how-israels-overreach-syria-may-backfire\">Israel’s expansionist policy in the region</a>, and concerns that it is using things like a proposed humanitarian corridor as a way to achieve recognition of areas only recently under Israeli control.</p>\n\n<h2>The fraught history of Syrian-Israeli relations</h2>\n\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/history/\">United Nations’ partition of Palestine in 1947</a> and the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/war-for-palestine/israel-and-the-arab-coalition-in-1948/DEAE4004B3CD32F1C5EFE7A85B56003D\">a coalition of five Arab armies</a>, including Syria, declared war on Israel and lost the ensuing conflict. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Soldiers stand by barbed-wire fences.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Israeli soldiers stand guard as Syrian Druze people cross back into Syria at the Israeli-Syrian border in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IsraelSyriaClashes/29bdf7af42eb47b5ba4e678dfaccd83f/photo\">AP Photo/Leo Correa</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As a result, Syria was forced to sign an <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/il20sy490720israeli-syrian20general20armistice20agreement.pdf\">armistice agreement</a> with Israel on July 20, 1949. </p>\n\n<p>Yet de facto peace never lasted long. The two countries squared off in repeated conflicts in the next 25 years, including the Six-Day War in 1967 that launched <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israel’s still-ongoing occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1974, the U.N. brokered the <a href=\"https://undof.unmissions.org/background\">Agreement on Disengagement</a> between Israeli and Syrian forces. While not a peace agreement, the pact served to codify a ceasefire and created a buffer zone between the two countries monitored by U.N. observers.</p>\n\n<p>For 50 years, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/16/world/israel-syria-talks-overview-syria-israel-begin-peace-talks-after-4-year-halt.html\">that status quo held uneasily</a>, as <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/madrid-conference\">subsequent peace efforts failed</a>. The conflict was effectively frozen, punctuated by occasional flare-ups of violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Entering the post-Assad era</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/\">fall of Assad and his goverment</a> in December 2024 suddenly injected a new dose of uncertainty into Israel-Syria relations.</p>\n\n<p>As rebel-turned interim President <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> worked to consolidate power and vowed to restore peace and stability for his war-torn country, Israel went on the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the collapse of the Assad government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement “<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-slams-violation-of-1974-disengagement-deal-as-israel-acts-in-syria-buffer-zone/\">void until order is restored in Syria</a>.” As a result, and in violation of the agreement, Israel occupied the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights and expanded its control inside Syria. For months, Israel has conducted a campaign <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/4/mapping-israels-expanding-air-attacks-across-syria\">of airstrikes across Syria</a>, repeatedly bombing Syrian military positions, including near the presidential palace in Damascus. Israel says it is doing so to stop weapon transfers from Iran and to protect its borders and ensure its security. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/\">it has pressed the U.S. to keep Syria weak and divided</a>, in part due to Netanyahu’s and his far-right coalition’s hostility to an Islamist-governed neighbor. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S., at the urging of allies like Saudi Arabia which are close with the Sharaa government, recently lifted sanctions on Syria. For months, officials of the Trump administration have likewise mediated talks and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/under-us-pressure-syria-israel-inch-toward-security-deal-2025-09-16/\">pushed Israel and Syria to conclude an agreement</a> to stop Israel’s seizures and air campaign. </p>\n\n<p>For his part, Sharaa and his negotiators have continually pressed for a halt to Israeli incursions and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/at-un-syrias-sharaa-slams-israeli-attacks-commits-to-1974-disengagement-seeks-dialogue/\">a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement</a> and the de facto borders it established, describing it as a “necessity.” </p>\n\n<h2>Hints of common ground on Hezbollah and Iran</h2>\n\n<p>Aside from Syria’s immediate desire and chief priority to end all hostilities on its territory, there are some potential benefits to a new arrangement with Israel from both countries’ perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Before its fall, the Assad government was close to Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/does-hezbollah-represent-lebanon-and-what-impact-will-the-death-of-longtime-leader-hassan-nasrallah-have-240062\">Hezbollah</a>, a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group funded by Iran, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/assads-fall-in-syria-will-further-weaken-hezbollah-and-curtails-tehrans-iranization-of-region-245606\">supported Assad and played a major role in Syria’s civil war</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, under Assad’s government, Syria served as a land bridge between Iran and Lebanon through which Hezbollah fighters transported their <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/03/double-dealers-lebanon-and-the-risks-of-captagon-trafficking?lang=en\">military equipment, money and drugs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Under Sharaa, Syria’s central government is now closely allied to the Arab Gulf countries that have long been Iran’s regional rivals. In strengthening its security, Syria will no longer serve as Hezbollah-Iran meeting point, which will subsequently benefit Israel. For Syria, it will also stabilize the country against Iranian interference. </p>\n\n<h2>The risk of Syria’s further fragmentation</h2>\n\n<p>The risks of a deal with Israel from Syria’s standpoint, however, are significant.</p>\n\n<p>In defending its incursions into Syria, Israel has pointed to both the security threat it says Syria poses to Israel and also the situation of minority groups in Syria, where sectarian violence has risen against communities like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79q8p8qx1do\">Christian Orthodox</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/08/syria-un-experts-alarmed-attacks-druze-communities-including-sexual-violence\">Druze</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel has floated a number of plans for how it intends to retain a heavy footprint in Syria beyond the occupation of the Golan Heights and the 1974 Agreement of Disengagement. </p>\n\n<p>One option on the table is an extension of the historical buffer zone and splitting Syria into autonomous zones, <a href=\"https://www.dohainstitute.org/en/PoliticalStudies/Pages/proposed-syria-israel-security-agreement-provisions-and-prospects.aspx\">in which Sweidah province</a> would be a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria. With the most recent idea of a humanitarian corridor couched in the language of protecting Syrian minorities, Israel could be seeking a wider area under more explicit control. </p>\n\n<p>From the Syrian perspective, all of the above are backdoor ways by Israel to cement post-Assad military actions beyond the scope of the 1974 truce. As such, agreement to a security pact on Israeli terms would mean jeopardizing or shrinking Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Demonstrators hold up flags.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Syrian protesters gather in front of Damascus Citadel to denounce Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip and to oppose any potential agreement that would lead to normalization of relations with Israel.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/protesters-gather-in-front-of-damascus-citadel-to-denounce-news-photo/2236488646?adppopup=true\">Hasan Belal/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The Syrian leadership’s challenge going forward</h2>\n\n<p>After years of war and fragmentation, most Syrians will take any cessation of hostilities with Israel as a welcome development – but not at any cost. Many Syrians are <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/analysis/federalism-or-fragmentation-future-syrias-minorities\">opposed to further fragmentation of the country</a>. And considering the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">killing and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza</a> – described recently <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">by a U.N. body as genocide</a> – and Syria’s historic commitment to pan-Arabism, many Syrians will likely be skeptical if a security deal with Israel means a de facto recognition of the land and sovereignty Israel has acquired since December 2024. </p>\n\n<p>That points to the major dilemma underpinning Sharaa’s position. Syria is in a vulnerable place and is not in position to negotiate from strength, especially as Sharaa tries to open Syria to the Western world, boost its economy and bring back the civil war refugees from neighboring countries. Seeking to consolidate his government’s hold on power and end the presence of a foreign military, Sharaa likely sees a security agreement as in his immediate interest.</p>\n\n<p>While such a pact may bring some stability to Syria and the region, it could also codify Israel’s nearly unchallenged regional power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265785/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mireille Rebeiz is affiliated with the American Red Cross. </span></em></p>",

Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images </a></span></figcaption></figure><p>On a recent early fall morning, hope was in short supply. </p>\n\n<p>My first patient was a regular. Mr. D was a man in his 50s with diabetes. He had been living on Denver’s streets for most of the past five years, two of them with a walker in tow. Without stable housing and reliable access to insulin, he’d come to the hospital that morning with another limb-threatening infection. </p>\n\n<p>I examined the telltale ulceration on the sole of his foot. It had progressed to the underlying bone and would require another amputation. This time he would be dependent on a wheelchair. I asked him about his prospects for housing. He shook his head and said, “Doc, I just keep falling through the cracks.”  </p>\n\n<p>Mr. D is one of the <a href=\"https://www.mdhi.org/pit\">10,774 people who experienced homelessness</a> on a single night in 2025 across metro Denver, according to a count conducted by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative and partner organizations. Of these, 35% were <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coc-esg-virtual-binders/coc-esg-homeless-eligibility/definition-of-chronic-homelessness/\">experiencing a chronic</a> form of homelessness. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man kneels with a cell phone in his hand next to a person who is sitting and holding a cane.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Each year, homeless service organizations count how many people are experiencing homelessness on one night in January. The count helps service providers and government entities understand the trends and needs of people experiencing homelessness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/volunteer-paul-benevides-veterans-specialist-with-the-news-photo/912294318?adppopup=true\">Joe Amon/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/6779\">an internal medicine physician</a> whose focus is caring for hospitalized patients, my experience suggests that this count is too low. People in hospitals and other institutional settings the day of the survey are not reflected in these numbers. Others are hard to spot, staying out of sight on couches or in creek beds, or hiding in plain sight while they serve our food or fix our roads. For these reasons, point-in-time counts <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/many-more-denver-teens-have-experienced-homelessness-than-official-counts-show-249997\">underestimate the true prevalence of homelessness</a> in the city.   </p>\n\n<p>I work at <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/about-denver-health\">Denver Health</a>, the region’s comprehensive safety net health system, where I’m on the front lines of Denver’s homelessness crisis. My perspectives on this issue have been shaped by nearly two decades of experience caring for some of the city’s most vulnerable patients.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve helped create and oversee hospital partnerships that help people like Mr. D find housing. But <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">recent federal actions</a> will only worsen homelessness and weaken the response to it in Colorado and across the nation.   </p>\n\n<h2>Falling through the cracks</h2>\n\n<p>When people like Mr. D fall through the cracks, my colleagues and I are there to catch them. In 2024, Denver Health served <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/-/media/files/about/annual-reports/Report%20to%20the%20City%202024%20Digital%20Final\">more than 16,000 patients experiencing homelessness</a> who collectively had 78,000 visits to the integrated health system. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve watched these cracks widen as Colorado has become one of the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap#summary-table\">least affordable places in the country to live</a>. According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 2025 a Coloradan can work more than 80 hours per week and <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/oor\">still be unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment</a>. This means that housing is woefully out of reach for many of my patients.  </p>\n\n<p>As physicians, we are trained to address the root causes of the diseases we treat. I care for elderly patients who are newly homeless following an eviction, as well as homeless veterans and Lyft drivers who sleep in their vehicles. Though their individual circumstances vary — loss of job or a loved one, an illness or a battle with addiction — the root cause of their homelessness is the same: a lack of affordable and available housing. </p>\n\n<p>Because of an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.0820\">increased prevalence of serious health conditions and structural barriers</a> – such as marginalization and discrimination – that prevent equitable access to primary and preventive health care, people experiencing homelessness often rely on hospitals like ours for care. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, roughly 1 in 6 adults admitted to Denver Health’s hospital for an illness or injury were experiencing homelessness, according to internal data. Like Mr. D, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.52163\">many are aging</a> and have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnw011\">cognitive and mobility impairments</a>, along with the frailty characteristic of much older patients.</p>\n\n<p>Those <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/unsheltered-homelessness/\">living unsheltered</a> suffer preventable harms such as frostbite and heatstroke in Colorado’s climate of extremes. And for many, homelessness is lethal. Last year at least <a href=\"https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/Medical-Examiner/Medical-Examiner-Data#section-6\">223 people</a> died while living on Denver’s streets. </p>\n\n<p>At Denver Health, homeless adults who are admitted to the hospital stay on average 2.4 days longer than housed patients, translating into 5,400 excess hospital days for Denver residents alone, according to internal data. And without a safe place to recover, they have significantly higher readmission rates.  </p>\n\n<p>Evidence of the negative impacts of homelessness on health and hospital resources is so compelling that <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/\">the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a> has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09136-4\">recognized homelessness as a comorbid condition</a>. This designation gives homelessness a similar weight to chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing the needless suffering brought about by patients’ lack of housing and feeling powerless to stop it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-025-09690-5\">contributes to moral injury</a> among health care providers. Moral injury refers to the psychological and emotional wounds that occur when one witnesses events that violate their moral and ethical beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve certainly recognized these feelings in myself or in colleagues who’ve been at the bedside with me all these years. To me, treating the symptoms of homelessness without addressing the underlying cause feels like treating a gunshot wound with a Band-Aid.</p>\n\n<h2>Cure for homelessness</h2>\n\n<p>But unlike many of the conditions I treat, homelessness does have a cure. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put, it’s deeply affordable and supportive housing. Evidence shows that <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487\">Housing First</a> – an approach that prioritizes housing as a critical foundation for engagement in health care services – results in high rates of housing stability and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.01041\">brings down high-cost health care utilization</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman sits in front of a hotel window next to a bike.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Roberta Ramirez stays at the Aspen, a noncongregate homelessness shelter in Denver.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/roberta-ramirez-stays-at-the-aspens-non-congregate-news-photo/2144486536?adppopup=true\">Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet many of the patients I treat, as one of my colleagues likes to say, “will never darken the door of a homeless service agency.” </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, only <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08909-1\">53% of patients on our health system’s homeless registry</a> were using homeless services in the community. In a cruel irony, the chaos of homelessness that forces people to prioritize survival, combined with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2022.2058580\">health conditions such as physical disabilities, dementia or serious mental illness</a>, often collude to prevent patients from engaging with the very systems that could end their homelessness. Sometimes, like Mr. D, they give up trying.</p>\n\n<p>This creates the heartbreaking situations I see in my daily work. Too often the patients with the greatest health care needs and vulnerability are the most underserved. </p>\n\n<p>Over time, I’ve learned that improving health inside the hospital walls increasingly means working beyond them to build collaborations to address the myriad ways our systems are failing patients like Mr. D.  </p>\n\n<h2>Housing and health partnerships</h2>\n\n<p>In Denver some progress has been made. In 2023 <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/newly-minted-denver-mayor-mike-johnston-issues-emergency-declaration-over-homelessness\">Mayor Mike Johnston issued an emergency declaration on homelessness</a>.

The hospital now leases 14 apartments that it makes available to provide temporary housing and case management to elderly or disabled patients experiencing homelessness following a hospitalization. Most of the 39 patients who have been housed there have attained more permanent housing, according to internal data.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOUxA8qiCcQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A 9News report on the office building converted into affordable housing in Denver.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Denver Health also partners on <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/denver-housing-health-project-housing-stability-payment-outcomes-second-report\">Denver’s Housing to Health Program</a>, a permanent supportive housing program launched in 2022 that aims to reduce health care expenditures for people experiencing chronic homelessness. A hospital team identifies eligible patients and provides “warm handoffs” to directly connect them with the program’s housing service providers during hospitalizations or emergency room visits. While the evaluation is ongoing, it’s a <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/harnessing-health-care-systems-enhance-supportive-housing\">promising partnership model</a> for how hospitals might collaborate to address homelessness.</p>\n\n<h2>Impact of federal policies and funding cuts</h2>\n\n<p>With accompanying investments in proven solutions to homelessness, such partnerships have the potential to deliver better care at lower cost. </p>\n\n<p>Actions taken by the federal government in 2025 that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">criminalize people experiencing homelessness, defund Housing First initiatives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/summary/00\">dismantle Medicaid and other essential benefits</a> threaten these partnerships and our progress. These policies will worsen homelessness, and patients will continue to be “housed” in the least appropriate and most expensive way – in the hospital. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to harming patients, this trend is not sustainable for safety net hospitals like Denver Health that already <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/29/denver-health-medicaid-sales-tax/\">provide millions of dollars annually in uncompensated care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a physician working at the intersection of housing and health, I believe hospitals are key partners in the fight to end homelessness. I’ve observed the hopelessness that homelessness can bring. But I’ve also seen how the right partnerships can transform a routine hospitalization into an unexpected opportunity for meaningful connection that puts patients on the path to housing and health. </p>\n\n<p>Now when I see patients like Mr. D, I see possibility rather than another dead end for them. After all, for all their adversity, my patients’ stories are also stories of beauty, strength and resilience. While the “cracks” keep me up at night, their stories, and the partnerships we’ve created, bring me hope at a time when hope seems in short supply. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Patient initials and other identifying details have been changed to protect confidentiality.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/local\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261234/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sarah A.

Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/csb-releases-final-report-on-2019-massive-tank-farm-fire-at-the-intercontinental-terminals-company-facility-in-deer-park-texas/\">more than 70 million gallons of petroleum</a> products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/intercontinental-terminals-company-pay-over-66-million-injuries-natural-resources-resulting\">determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines</a>. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1386420.015\">no reason to investigate further</a> or impose fines or other penalties on the company.</p>\n\n<p>A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/mission/\">seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents</a>. It’s an approach much like the <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process/Pages/default.aspx\">National Transportation Safety Board</a> takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/\">prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That deep investigative process <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">reportedly will not happen</a> in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery</a> in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/ehs/phdstudents/steenstra-philip.html\">scholars</a> of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZieRajIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">chemical</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3QFImkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">disasters</a>, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget</a> – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A fire at several large round buildings sends dark black smoke into the sky.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A fire burns at Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Petrochemical-Fire-Texas/0164e16ea5d34ed4afb24146e1e3931d/photo\">AP Photo/David J.

They included necessary updates to safety management systems, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/itc_report_-_final_(july_6,_2023).pdf\">the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks</a>, and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/?F_InvestigationId=3602\">reportedly working on the next two</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_ripe_study_finalv.pdf\">storage tanks be spaced farther apart</a> so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review.</p>\n\n<p>And the Texas fire was just <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/investigations/completed-investigations/?F_FromDate=1/1/2019&amp;F_ToDate=12/31/2019\">one of several disasters</a> the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">investigations of 102 chemical disasters</a> in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_strategic_plan11.pdf\">France, South Korea and China</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ReYsPKwVy64?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board video summarizes the agency’s findings about a March 2019 petrochemical terminal fire in Texas.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Creation and goals of the CSB</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/history/\">created by Congress in a 1990 amendment</a> to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Those included the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.051\">1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy</a>, which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in <a href=\"https://origins.osu.edu/read/bhopal-chemical-gas-disaster\">Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate</a> from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident\">Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster</a> in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">prevent similar accidents from occurring</a> on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically designed to be <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/chemical-safety-and-hazard-investigation-board\">independent of other organizations and political influence</a>, the CSB <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">cannot be forced to modify its findings</a> by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality. </p>\n\n<p>It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">recommendations are adopted by the industries affected</a>, usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"LWgds\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LWgds/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What does the board do?</h2>\n\n<p>There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-VI/part-1604\">releases of particular chemicals</a>, such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride.</p>\n\n<p>The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded.</p>\n\n<p>After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry.</p>\n\n<h2>The board’s value</h2>\n\n<p>The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\">more than $6 trillion</a> the U.S. government spends each year.</p>\n\n<p>The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA</a>. But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the CSB has <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/public-comments/\">helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations</a>, such as for the <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_epa_rcra_comment_letter_5-14-2024_(004).pdf\">open burning of waste explosives</a>, and improved methods of <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_comments_epa-hq-oem-2015-0725_51020161.pdf\">investigating accidental chemical releases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_osha_emergency_response_comment_letter_7-12-2024.pdf\">implementing new emergency response rules</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265546/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.lifeofthomaspain00lint/?st=gallery\">one of America’s founders</a>, laughing louder than anybody. </p>\n\n<p>That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/16/the-sharpened-quill\">titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. </p>\n\n<p>Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/american-enlightenment-thought/\">underrated American pastime</a>, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” </p>\n\n<p>I could go on. Because he did. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A yellowed copy of a short publication with the title 'Common Sense.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Published in 1776, Thomas Paine’s pamphlet ‘Common Sense’ inveighed against monarchy and hereditary privilege and in favor of independence for the Colonies.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.si.edu/collections/snapshot/eloquent-argument\">Smithsonian National Museum of American History</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Birth of a revolutionary</h2>\n\n<p>Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine\">small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737</a>. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, <a href=\"https://www.laits.utexas.edu/gov310/CF/Paine_Sense/index.html\">met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London</a>, sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical.  </p>\n\n<p>Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">renounced, repudiated and ridiculed</a> at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/PaineRightsOfMan/mode/2up\">Hereditary privilege, colonialism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.ageofreason00pain_0/?st=gallery\">the supernatural</a>: no, no, no. </p>\n\n<p>But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">were kings</a>. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1776ThomasPaine.pdf\">Common Sense,” his first major work</a>, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694951/original/file-20251007-56-zkg03b.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lawn signs that quote 'No King!

It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” </p>\n\n<p>Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. </p>\n\n<p>“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.</p>\n\n<h2>Bring the Paine</h2>\n\n<p>The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.</p>\n\n<p>This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A somewhat puckish-looking middle-aged man from the 18th century, holding a\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A somewhat puckish-looking Thomas Paine – with the wrong first name and a different spelling of his last one.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://npg.si.edu/exhibit/paine/pop-ups/01-01.html\">National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.</p>\n\n<p>“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/\">Federal worker firings</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006\">court settlements</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025\">a government shutdown</a>. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.</p>\n\n<p>Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. </p>\n\n<p>The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.   </p>\n\n<p>Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Matthew Redmond does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, the framework explicitly states that Hamas must be excised from any future discussions of postwar Gaza. Moreover, no other Palestinian group has any direct involvement; Hamas’ main rival Fatah – the party that is in control of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank – is only briefly mentioned. As for that Palestinian Authority, there is only a vague line about reforming the body.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been no mention of what the Palestinian people might actually want. In this way, the body being proposed recalls the creation of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority during the invasion of Iraq. That body governed Iraq immediately following the invasion and was <a href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/11/02/failures_of_the_coalition_provisional_authority_in_iraq_112574.html\">criticized for corruption and lack of transparency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The failure of the Iraq War, and the U.K.’s involvement in it, contributed to Blair’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/10/tonyblair.labour\">resignation as prime minister</a> in 2007, after which he took on the role of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/the-quartet/\">special envoy to the Quartet</a>. Led by the U.N., U.S., EU and Russia, the Quartet was tasked with preserving some form of the two-state solution and implementing economic development plans in Palestinian cities. </p>\n\n<p>But it, too, failed to address the changing political realities on the ground as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/israeli-settlements/\">Israeli settlements expanded</a> and the military occupation deepened.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying assumption about the Quartet, critics contend, is that it largely ignored the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty; rather, it focused on marginally improving economic conditions and Band-Aid initiatives. </p>\n\n<p>The latest U.S.-backed proposal cribs heavily from the approach. Even if it does bring about a welcome respite from the suffering in Gaza in the short term, I believe a durable, mutually agreed upon resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires what Trump’s plan sidelines: Palestinian self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>In Northern Ireland, Blair once understood the importance of neutral mediation and the buy-in of all parties to the conflict and the people themselves. The plan he is involved with now appears to be operating with a far different calculus.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266742/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dana El Kurd is affiliated with the Arab Center Washington. </span></em></p>",

These are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZaHhxJEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I’m a MOF scientist</a> and for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me.</p>\n\n<h2>So, what exactly are MOFs?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern.

In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests.</p>\n\n<h2>Why scientists love them</h2>\n\n<p>What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space.

Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m91P-R3kxOs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So far, scientists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17755-8\">synthesized over 90,000 MOFs</a>, and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. </p>\n\n<p>Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01650\">isoreticular MOFs</a>. These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture.</p>\n\n<h2>Pushing the boundaries of these materials</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses.</p>\n\n<p>Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr2003272\">capturing carbon dioxide</a> from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">clean polluted water</a> by removing heavy metals, dyes or “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-pfas-the-forever-chemicals-showing-up-in-drinking-water-an-environmental-health-scientist-explains-185015\">forever chemicals</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.200601878\">for medical applications</a>. In the energy world, they function <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214715\">as electrodes or electrolytes</a> that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr9003924\">serve as catalysts</a>, accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. </p>\n\n<p>When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja903726m\">named MIL-125</a>. It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Demos_Techniques_and_Experiments/General_Lab_Techniques/Proper_Use_of_a_Desiccator\">no desiccator</a> – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench.</p>\n\n<p>That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">withstand water, heat and repeated use</a>. Since their foundation, researchers around the world have <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/materials/metal-organic-frameworks/conductive-MOFs-electrocatalyst-sensors/99/i43\">introduced new properties to these materials</a> – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. </p>\n\n<p>Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">clean water straight from desert air</a>, to building more <a href=\"https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/cooling-homes-without-warming-the-planet/\">energy-efficient air conditioners</a>. What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world.</p>\n\n<h2>A Nobel moment that honors creativity</h2>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/press-release/\">honoring three remarkable scientists</a> – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies.</p>\n\n<p>When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in <a href=\"https://kampouri.blogs.rice.edu/\">my own research group</a>, we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this Nobel Prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: Chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267089/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stavroula (Alina) Kampouri receives research funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF) and other public research agencies.</span></em></p>",

Using quantum systems to perform computation promises to allow researchers <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-advantage-a-quantum-computing-scientist-explains-an-approaching-milestone-marking-the-arrival-of-extremely-powerful-computers-213306\">to solve problems</a> in areas from chemistry to cryptography that have so many possible solutions that they are beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful nonquantum computers possible. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum computing depends on researchers developing practical quantum technologies. Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/\">Nobel Prize in physics</a> was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a physicist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=q1_eBhsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies superconducting circuits</a> for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted.</p>\n\n<h2>Big, cold, quantum</h2>\n\n<p>In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/profile/john-martinis/\">John Martinis</a>, then-postdoctoral researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2CeGqLAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Michel Devoret</a> and UC Berkeley professor <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R7uhrOoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works\">John Clarke</a> showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-do-superconductors-work-a-physicist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-resistance-free-electricity-202308\">superconductors</a>. A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. </p>\n\n<p>Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. </p>\n\n<p>Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"four parallel brass-colored rings connected by vertical tubes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/AFMC-News/Article/2470321/afrl-measures-first-superconducting-quantum-bits-qubit-first-ever-demo-for-a-do/\">U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.014021\">near-ideal microwave amplifier</a> based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8654\">emulate a group of electron-like particles</a>. This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. </p>\n\n<p>In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58947-4\">demonstrate a protocol</a> for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. </p>\n\n<p>But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing.</p>\n\n<h2>Superconducting quantum computers</h2>\n\n<p>Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-entanglement-a-physicist-explains-the-science-of-einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-191927\">entangled</a>, so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. </p>\n\n<p>In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them.</p>\n\n<p>Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else.</p>\n\n<p>The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, academic research groups <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/lfl/\">like mine</a> develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118297/ibm-large-scale-error-corrected-quantum-computer-by-2028/\">create large-scale quantum processors</a> for practical use. </p>\n\n<h2>Superconductor pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has <a href=\"https://qolab.ai/\">his own company</a>, while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. </p>\n\n<p>I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. </p>\n\n<p>Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266979/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Levenson-Falk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They allege that the president has it out for Comey, who investigated <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-defends-russia-investigation-essential-testimony-senate-panel/story?id=73338331\">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election and was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527663050/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired by Trump</a> in 2017. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s own words support the idea that the Trump administration is targeting Comey. <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\">In a social media post</a> on Sept. 20, 2025, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with prosecutions against Comey, Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James: “They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. …JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p>\n\n<p>If the case against Comey is exceedingly weak – and little more than a political prosecution – then, in my view <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kdr4x8oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">as a scholar of the U.S. legal system</a>, it should result in the dismissal of charges by the judge or a not guilty verdict by the jury.</p>\n\n<p>But even when an individual is not convicted, the process of defending against charges can itself <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=oPAWAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">be a form of punishment</a>, as renowned legal scholar <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/malcolm-feeley/#tab_profile\">Malcolm Feeley</a> pointed out almost 50 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how the criminal justice process punishes even innocent people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The criminal justice process</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/steps-federal-criminal-process\">criminal justice process is complex</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indictment\">grand jury returns an indictment</a> at the request of a prosecutor, the accused <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/arraignment\">appears in court for their arraignment</a>. They are informed of the charges against them and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/plea\">typically enter a plea</a>. </p>\n\n<p>During what’s called “<a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/procedure/discovery-in-criminal-cases/\">discovery</a>,” the prosecution and defense investigate the evidence the other side plans to rely on. There are also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pretrial-motions\">pretrial motions</a> in which the parties ask judges to dismiss charges and accept or exclude evidence. </p>\n\n<p>The defense and prosecution may also meet to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pleabargaining\">discuss a plea bargain</a>, wherein the accused may plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence or reduced charges. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no plea bargain, then the case moves to trial, which is itself a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/trial\">complicated process</a>. If a defendant is found guilty, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/appeal\">they can mount an appeal</a> to higher courts in an attempt to have their conviction overturned.</p>\n\n<p>To help navigate this process, criminal defendants typically hire a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>And good lawyers don’t come cheap.</p>\n\n<h2>Money and time</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indigent\">Indigent defendants</a>, who do not have the financial resources to pay their own legal fees, <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/defender-services\">can rely on public defenders</a> paid for by the government. </p>\n\n<p>But individuals who can afford to pay for their own lawyer face a substantial financial burden for attorney services <a href=\"https://www.criminallegalnews.org/media/publications/brennan_center_for_justice_reentry_report_2010.pdf\">and court fees</a>. An experienced criminal defense lawyer can charge <a href=\"https://ludwiglawfirm.com/understanding-the-real-cost-of-hiring-a-federal-criminal-defense-lawyer\">more than US$1,000</a> <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/big-law-firm-sues-hunter-biden-for-unpaid-legal-bills-tied-to-gun-trial-other-cases/\">per hour</a>, with fees quickly adding up. This means that mounting a legal defense can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, it takes a great deal of time to prepare for a criminal case. While lawyers and their staff do much of the legwork for trial preparation, a client works with their attorneys to help formulate a defense.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, criminal defendants lose one of the most <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethharris/2017/08/30/study-shows-time-is-the-most-valuable-commodity-so-heres-a-smart-way-to-value-time/\">precious commodities in the world</a>: their time.</p>\n\n<p>And this time can come at a tangible cost in the form of lost wages, which harms their day-to-day lives. Put simply, every hour spent preparing for trial is an hour defendants could spend working or enjoying their lives.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three women holding each other as they stand outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Patrice Failor, center, wife of former FBI Director James Comey, is embraced by daughters Claire Comey, left, and Maurene Comey at the courthouse in Alexandria, Va., where James Comey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Oct. 8, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/patrice-failor-wife-of-former-fbi-director-james-comey-is-news-photo/2239936179?adppopup=true\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Stress and embarrassment</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not pleasant being charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p>The criminal process, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344888776_Delivering_Timely_Justice_in_Criminal_Cases_A_National_Picture\">which typically lasts months</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mdlawgroup.ca/articles/how-to-manage-stress-during-a-criminal-trial\">takes a toll</a> on one’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2021.100050\">mental</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13218719.2020.1751327\">health</a>. This is largely driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a criminal trial and the possibility of losing one’s freedom if convicted.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2014.1004035\">social stigma</a> that comes with being accused of a crime. This can result in reputational damage, anxiety and embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration appears to recognize this reality. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-agent-relieved-duty-over-refusing-comey-perp-walk-four-people-familiar-say-2025-10-03/\">Several media</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">outlets</a> have reported that FBI leadership had planned a public <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perp%20walk\">perp walk</a> for Comey. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">According to a CBS News report</a>, this was to have included “‘large, beefy’ agents … ‘in full kit,’ including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo.” Apparently, the plan was aborted after several FBI supervisors refused to cooperate, viewing it as inappropriate. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/04/politics/fbi-agent-fired-comey\">One agent was disciplined for insubordination</a> after refusing to go along with the plan to embarrass Comey in this way. </p>\n\n<h2>Not all criminal defendants suffer the same</h2>\n\n<p>The extent to which criminal defendants experience the criminal justice process as a form of punishment varies from person to person.</p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.finance-monthly.com/james-comeys-net-worth-in-2025-a-deep-dive-into-the-life-and-career-of-the-former-fbi-director/\">high-status people like Comey</a>, lost wages and attorneys’ and court fees may not be that big of a deal. </p>\n\n<p>But these costs may be incredibly significant for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/list-individuals-including-lisa-cook-targeted-trump-administration/story?id=124968309\">other people</a> who have been, or are likely to be, targeted by the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>The high costs of lawyers’ fees are well known to the president. For instance, his political action committee spent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508\">millions of dollars</a> on attorneys’ fees in an unsuccessful effort to defend Trump from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0\">criminal charges</a> in New York.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, people no doubt experience the psychological stress and stigma of a possible criminal conviction differently. But regardless of one’s wealth, the lost time spent preparing a criminal defense is something that cannot be replaced.</p>\n\n<p>The recognition that the criminal process is itself a form of punishment is one of the reasons that the <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/legal-ethics-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/03/GT-GJLE230038.pdf\">Department of Justice has maintained independence</a> from the president. By <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html\">violating the tradition</a> of staying out of politics, the Justice Department in the Trump administration has opened the door for the president to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies.</p>\n\n<p>The mere act of putting them through the criminal process ensures that they suffer, regardless of their guilt or innocence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266747/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Paul M.

Scott Applewhite</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury on Sept. 25, 2025 – only the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/james-comey-indicted.html\">second time in history</a> an FBI director has faced criminal charges. </p>\n\n<p>The indictment came just five days after President Donald Trump took to social media to demand that Comey be prosecuted, and three days after Trump installed a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/politics/lindsey-halligan-us-attorney-eastern-virginia-trump-james-comey\">former aide</a> as the prosecutor to bring the case. </p>\n\n<p>Legal experts <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/former-doj-officials-warn-comey-indictment-is-a-democracy-threatening-abuse-of-power/\">across the political spectrum</a> describe this as an unprecedented political prosecution that breaks fundamental democratic norms and mirrors tactics used by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-26/comey-indictment-if-everyone-is-guilty-no-one-is-accountable\">authoritarian leaders</a> worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70rnLI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a professor of law</a>, I think Comey’s indictment is momentous because it tests a principle that has protected American democracy for 50 years: Presidents should not direct prosecutors to charge their political enemies. </p>\n\n<p>When leaders can abuse the justice system to target critics and investigators, the rule of law collapses.</p>\n\n<h2>An unconstitutional indictment</h2>\n\n<p>The evidence of political interference in Comey’s indictment is unusually strong. Trump waged an eight-year vendetta against Comey after the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-defends-russia-investigation-essential-testimony-senate-panel/story?id=73338331\">FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 20, Trump <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgg4vgeedo\">posted on Truth Social</a> demanding prosecution: “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell… We can’t delay any longer… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” </p>\n\n<p>After the indictment, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/justice-america-trump-applauds-indictment-dirty-cop-james/story?id=125958551\">Trump called Comey</a> “one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to.”</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment protects against vindictive and selective prosecution. To prove vindictive prosecution, a defendant must show through objective evidence that the prosecutor acted with “genuine animus” and that the defendant would not have been prosecuted except for that hostility.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Five men in suits and ties sit at a table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Comey listens to the committee chairman at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 8, 2017, in Washington.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=comey&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Alex Brandon</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit explained in <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-4th-circuit/1040785.html\">United States v. Wilson</a> in 2001, the government cannot prosecute someone to punish them “for doing what the law plainly allows him to do.” When circumstances create a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the burden shifts to the government to justify its conduct.</p>\n\n<p>After Comey’s indictment, <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-charges-fbi-donald-trump-rcna233662\">Jordan Rubin</a>, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.’s office, stated: “If the Trump administration’s prosecution of James Comey isn’t ‘selective’ and ‘vindictive,’ then those words have lost all meaning.”</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://fb1cd5ab-5a51-475c-87d1-10904a61146d.usrfiles.com/ugd/fb1cd5_e6234e4a9b5244e8bd59ab3af293ca51.pdf\">three former White House ethics counsels</a> – Norman Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter – wrote to Congress after Comey’s indictment, saying that in the U.S. “a president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin’s Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here. Until now.” </p>\n\n<p>They concluded: “If the Trump administration can do this, then no American is safe from political prosecution.”</p>\n\n<h2>Broken judicial norms</h2>\n\n<p>For 50 years since the Watergate scandal that exposed President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power, American presidents have followed a core principle: They must not interfere in decisions about who gets investigated or charged, especially not for political reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department’s manual includes the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/\">post-Watergate</a> requirement that legal judgments must be “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-1-8000-congressional-relations\">impartial and insulated from political influence</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/james-comey-indictment-fbi-trump-halligan-rcna233910\">three former ethics counsels emphasized</a> that during their service, they “never once saw” Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton “suggest that the Department of Justice should prosecute a specific person, much less a political adversary.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">Comey was indicted on two counts</a> – one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, both in connection with his testimony before a Senate committee in September 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The allegations against Comey were reviewed multiple times. Special counsel John Durham examined them <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/former-special-counsel-john-durham-122036443.html\">during Trump’s first term</a>. Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., during the Biden administration <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/special-counsel-john-durham-undercut-case-james-comey/story?id=126164120\">called Comey to testify before a grand jury</a> about allegedly using his friend Daniel Richman as a conduit to leak information to the press. And <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutors-memo-new-us-attorney-recommended-plans-charge/story?id=125925246\">career prosecutors in 2025 under former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert</a> also reviewed the allegations. Everyone <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-125933152.html\">declined to charge Comey</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The procedural breakdown reveals how fundamentally this case violates norms. </p>\n\n<p>Career prosecutors wrote <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutors-memo-new-us-attorney-recommended-plans-charge/story?id=125925246\">a memo in September 2025</a> stating they could not establish probable cause to charge Comey. When Siebert refused to proceed, Trump removed him and installed Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/white-house-aide-erik-siebert-office\">former personal defense attorney</a>. She has no prosecutorial experience.</p>\n\n<p>Three days later, Halligan brought the indictment. She signed it alone – no career prosecutors put their names on it, as is usually done. The grand jury rejected one of the three charges prosecutors tried to bring, a rare signal of weak evidence.  </p>\n\n<p>Comey’s son-in-law, Troy A. Edwards Jr., a federal prosecutor in the same office where Halligan now works, resigned immediately, stating he was leaving “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/politics/troy-edwards-jr-resigns-comey-indictment\">to uphold my oath to the Constitution</a>.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/08/comey-arraignment-trump/\">Comey was arraigned on Oct. 8</a> and pleaded not guilty.</p>\n\n<h2>Echoes of authoritarians</h2>\n\n<p>Prosecuting former law enforcement officials who investigated the country’s leader is not typical of democracies. It is a hallmark tactic of authoritarian rulers seeking to consolidate power.</p>\n\n<p>In Turkey, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/middleeast/turkey-istanbul-mayor-arrest.html\">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrested his main political rival</a> in March 2025 on corruption charges that critics call politically motivated. Between 2014 and 2020, Erdogan investigated 160,000 Turks for insulting the president and prosecuted 45,000 of them, including a <a href=\"https://www.turkishminute.com/2023/07/12/14-year-old-get-suspended-sentence-for-insult-president-erdogan-on-whatsapp/\">14-year-old boy</a>. More than <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2025/3/26/turkey\">1,400 people were arrested and detained</a> in nationwide protests.</p>\n\n<p>Russia under Vladimir Putin provides the starkest example.

Maduro inherited a stacked Supreme Court from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, that has systematically <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/31/venezuelas-crumbling-facade-democracy\">nullified opposition legislation</a>. The court has also orchestrated takeovers of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/31/venezuelas-crumbling-facade-democracy\">opposition parties</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuelas-supreme-court-certifies-maduros-claims-won-presidential-ele-rcna168020\">certified Maduro’s fraudulent 2024 election claim</a> despite opposition evidence showing it won by a 2-to-1 margin. </p>\n\n<p>And Hungary’s Viktor Orban created the <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/orbans-sovereignty-protectors-hammer-government-critics/\">Sovereignty Protection Office</a> with powers to investigate any organization or person it suspects of receiving foreign support to influence public life or the democratic process. Orban also installed <a href=\"https://eutoday.net/viktor-orban-turned-hungary-into-a-corruption-state/\">a loyalist chief prosecutor</a> under whose office “numerous high-profile allegations of corruption have been either quietly shelved or investigated perfunctorily before being dropped,” according to EU Today. </p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear: When leaders can use the justice system to protect themselves, whether by prosecuting investigators, refusing to investigate corruption or intimidating the judiciary, democratic institutions erode and the rule of law becomes a tool of political control rather than a constraint on power.</p>\n\n<h2>What this means for America</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/26/james-comey-indictment-flaws-00582920\">Legal experts predict</a> Comey will be acquitted – the evidence is weak and the political interference is blatant. </p>\n\n<p>But as a scholar of legal ethics, I believe the damage is already done. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has shown he can force prosecutors to charge his enemies.

A string of high-profile corporate partnerships reflect how universities are embracing AI technology.</p>\n\n<p>The University of Florida began assembling one of the fastest university supercomputers through a collaboration with Nvidia encompassing <a href=\"https://ai.ufl.edu/research/ai-support/nvidia-partnership/\">AI infrastructure, research support and curriculum development</a>. Princeton launched the New Jersey AI Hub with Microsoft, CoreWeave and the state government, which will house <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/03/princeton-features-research-ai-hub-microsoft-coreweave-techsparks\">AI startups on university-owned land under a Princeton director</a>. Meanwhile, the California State University system partnered with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu to all students and faculty, branding itself as “<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-the-csu-system/\">the first AI-powered university system in the United States</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>As a social scientist who studies educational technology and organizational partnerships, I view these collaborations as part of a decades-long shift toward the “<a href=\"http://www.doi.org/10.25148/CRCP.1.1.6092151\">corporatization” of higher education</a> – where universities have become increasingly market-driven, aligning their priorities, culture and governance structures with industry partners. </p>\n\n<p>I see the rise of generative AI as accelerating this trend, which risks undermining higher education’s autonomy and public service mission. Examining the underlying organizational forces that shape the future of higher education can shed light on how AI challenges universities’ traditional principles – and how they might resist corporate influence.</p>\n\n<h2>The rise of corporate partnerships</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past 50 years, private sector support for university research has <a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/wp-content/uploads/driving-us-competitiveness-through-improved-university-industry-partnerships.pdf\">increased tenfold</a>, outpacing overall growth in higher education research spending. A pivotal shift came in 1980, when universities gained the right to retain intellectual property from federally funded research. This made <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/147/4/76/27224/Universities-The-Fallen-Angels-of-Bayh-Dole\">commercialization of university research far easier</a>. Over time, corporate involvement pushed university research toward commercial needs and increasingly exposed universities to the profit motive.</p>\n\n<p>But partnerships haven’t just brought in money for universities; they’ve reinforced <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/3283/academic-capitalism-and-new-economy?srsltid=AfmBOordEdn9U2nlAlx0H3WCLrb4cXICwUuHfKQW4GstaJSjqkeogDOw\">a shift toward closer alignment with industry</a>. Universities expanded dramatically in the second half of the 20th century to <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/11659/great-mistake?srsltid=AfmBOopx1PZQZz2hhFrFQ_aMdaRFS-y8Nkku1uhl8KbcB-dYroOtPs9C\">meet companies’ demand for skilled labor</a>, further coupling higher education to market incentives. </p>\n\n<p>After decades of growth, however, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5246200/demographic-cliff-fewer-college-students-mean-fewer-graduates\">university enrollment peaked in 2010</a>, partly due to demographics, and <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-enrollment-decline/\">the decline is projected to continue</a>. Meanwhile, competition from training programs offered by tech companies <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/07/12/amazon-spend-700-million-training-mostly-outside-college\">has been growing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/mapping-federal-funding-cuts-to-us-colleges-and-universities/\">federal funding has been slashed under President Donald Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As colleges continue to close at <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/tracking-college-closures/\">record rates</a>, the imperative to attract tuition dollars and research grants <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549264/knowledge-for-sale/\">increasingly dictates institutional priorities</a>. I argue that universities risk sidelining research that serves the public interest by looking toward corporate funding and partnerships to fill the gaps. </p>\n\n<p>In my view, the shift away from public-good scholarship to monetizable content and services shaped by external industry partners jeopardizes the academic freedom and intellectual stewardship that once anchored the mission of higher education. For example, under financial constraints, university administrators may be inclined to overlook glaring value misalignments between their public mission and the commercial objectives of AI firms. </p>\n\n<h2>The forces driving universities’ AI initiatives</h2>\n\n<p>At many universities, AI adoption and the turn toward corporate collaborations are driven by more than economic vulnerabilities. The broad range of partnerships with AI companies across higher education can provide insight into the deeper dynamics at work.</p>\n\n<p>Differences in AI partnerships are <a href=\"https://internet2.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2-CDE24-RESEARCH-REPORT_Internet2_HED_V.pdf\">emerging around long-standing divides between types of institutions</a>. <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/\">Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI</a> can be interpreted as an attempt to steer global discourse on ethical AI while preserving human-led research as a marker of elite prestige. Meanwhile, AI initiatives at institutions with a strong focus on teaching and accessibility, such as <a href=\"https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/CSU-AI-Powered-Initiative.aspx\">California State University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/artificial-intelligence/2024/05/21/unpacking-asus-openai-partnership-and\">Arizona State University</a>, appear to prioritize efficiency in learning outcomes and workforce development.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A student at California State University campus walks past a library.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The California State University system aims to become the first and largest ‘AI-powered university system,’ motivated in part to prepare students for careers in an AI-driven economy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/university-library-at-california-state-university-news-photo/2230923663\">Myung J. Chun via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This underscores how AI partnerships are not guided by market incentives alone. Before universities <a href=\"https://hep.gse.harvard.edu/9781682538920/lifting-the-veil-on-enrollment-management/\">grew into multibillion-dollar businesses</a>, their decision-making was primarily driven by markers of intellectual prestige, such as scholarly excellence and faculty reputation. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3448276.pdf\">Universities largely held a monopoly over knowledge production</a> and served as the primary gatekeepers of intellectual legitimacy, until the digital revolution dramatically <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/users/887687/articles/1265994-the-crumbling-ivory-tower-how-academia-abandoned-knowledge-for-status\">decentralized access to knowledge and its production</a>. Universities now coexist in – and increasingly compete with – a crowded, complex ecosystem of companies and organizations that produce original research. </p>\n\n<p>Generative AI represents a powerful new mode of knowledge production and synthesis, which further threatens to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/an-academic-publisher-has-struck-an-ai-data-deal-with-microsoft-without-their-authors-knowledge-235203\">upend traditional forms of scholarship</a>. Confronted with challenges to their authority, universities may attempt to preserve their elite intellectual status by rushing into partnerships with AI companies <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-nextgenai/\">eager to capture the higher education market</a>. </p>\n\n<p>My interpretation is that economic pressures and the pursuit of prestige may be converging to reinforce a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016146811311500507?casa_token=kxfAIufL0swAAAAA:cQGwuNpjEcqWQRjT_weYyPPL0VeCB3sttza4D2_Rhs5wh9s5O2tvt93FQNtWp1TNZPYUsdTeNYp0KYs\">technocratic approach to higher education</a>, where university decision-making is primarily guided by performance metrics and corporate-style governance rather than the public interest. </p>\n\n<h2>A purposeful path forward</h2>\n\n<p>The evolution of higher education in response to AI has brought <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-is-driving-down-the-price-of-knowledge-universities-have-to-rethink-what-they-offer-260493\">long-standing debates about the purpose of universities to the forefront of public discourse</a>. Decades of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/59723\">corporatization</a> has helped fuel widespread “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_02082\">mission sprawl</a>” and conflicting institutional goals across higher education. Consistent with <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/business/external-control-organizations\">organizational theory</a>, ambiguity about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html\">universities’ role in society</a> could lead many institutions to become increasingly susceptible to corporate co-optation, political interference and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/2025/04/14/who-will-thrive-who-will-struggle-and-who-will-disappear\">eventual collapse</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Although partnerships between universities and corporations can <a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/wp-content/uploads/driving-us-competitiveness-through-improved-university-industry-partnerships.pdf\">advance research and support students</a>, corporate norms and academic principles <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/documents/embed/link/LF2255DA3DD1C41C0A42D3BEF0989ACAECE3053A6A9B/file/D6C84643C00154ECD928B6B61B491896F6D965314ABA?noSaveAs=1\">are inherently distinct</a>. And at many universities the process through which differences in institutional values are surfaced and reconciled is unclear, especially as <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/07/22/faculty-often-missing-university-decisions-ai\">AI initiatives have often sidestepped democratic faculty governance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The recent surge in AI partnerships puts in plain view the growing dominance of market forces in higher education. As universities continue to adopt AI technologies, the consequences for intellectual freedom, democratic decision-making and commitment to the public good will become an increasingly pressing question.</p>\n\n<p><em>Research support was provided by undergraduate research assistant Mehra Marzbani, whose contributions are gratefully acknowledged.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260902/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Chris Wegemer is affiliated with UCLA. </span></em></p>",

She testified that the 1944 MGM movie “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036378/\">Song of Russia</a>” showed clean, well-dressed, happy peasants, which she said was a sanitized, propagandized version of life in the USSR.</p>\n\n<p>Another movie that came under suspicion was “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The <a href=\"https://aphelis.net/wonderful-life-communist-propaganda-fbi-files/\">FBI complained that the 1946 blockbuster</a>, which starred Jimmy Stewart as a broken man who learns the true value of his life, “deliberately maligned the upper classes” with its negative portrayal of Mr. Potter, the town’s richest man.</p>\n\n<p>The HUAC hearings continued for a decade and divided Hollywood. The committee’s interrogators <a href=\"https://theamericanscholar.org/the-director-who-named-names/\">demanded that people turn on each other</a> and “name names.” Due to these hearings, as well as an anti-communist publication called <a href=\"https://broadcast41.uoregon.edu/articles/red-channels-report-communist-influence-radio-and-television\">Red Channels</a>, hundreds of screenwriters, directors, producers, actors and musicians were <a href=\"https://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/index.php/exhibits/the-hollywood-blacklist-collections/\">fired or blacklisted</a> for having ties to liberal groups.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Ten men in suits stand together in a black-and-white photograph taken in the mid-20th century.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nine of 10 Hollywood writers, directors and producers, indicted by a Washington grand jury on charges of contempt of Congress, surrender in a group at the U.S. Marshals Service office in Los Angeles on Dec. 10, 1947.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/HollywoodRedScare/7c08a3a817f249d1b1566b76d8bc5b39/photo\">AP Photo/Harold Filan</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fighting back</h2>\n\n<p>The HUAC hearings brought Hollywood stars and the flashbulbs of the nation’s press corps to Capitol Hill. Conservative screen idols like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000011/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_Gary%2520Cooper\">Gary Cooper</a> testified that communism wasn’t “on the level.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6442\">Friendly witnesses</a>, like Rand and Cooper, were allowed to read prepared statements and to speak for as long as they liked. Such courtesies were not granted to the 10 “unfriendly” witnesses – the suspected communists who became known as the “<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/hollywood-10-biographies\">Hollywood 10</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493251/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1\">John Howard Lawson</a> was the first of the Hollywood 10 to testify. Lawson, after refusing to answer if he was a communist or not, was shouted down by Rep. <a href=\"https://spartacus-educational.com/USAparnell.htm\">J. Parnell Thomas</a>, a New Jersey Republican who served as HUAC chair. After Lawson was removed from the courtroom, HUAC’s chief investigator, Robert Stripling, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41940180\">read detailed evidence</a> of Lawson’s communist affiliations.</p>\n\n<p>Prominent Hollywood liberals understood that these hearings were an attack on free speech, free assembly and other rights <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\">guaranteed by the First Amendment</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/ira-gershwin/\">Ira Gershwin</a>, the lyricist known for his hit show tunes such as “I Got Rhythm” and “They Can’t Take That Away From Me,” hosted the first gathering of the Committee for the First Amendment at his Beverly Hills mansion. Attendees included Judy Garland, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly. </p>\n\n<p>The committee quickly raised US$13,000 – the equivalent of $188,000 today – and chartered an airplane to Washington. Upon their arrival in the capital, they <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/group-of-hollywood-celebrities-are-shown-here-as-they-news-photo/515241846?adppopup=true\">marched and spoke out</a> in support of the Hollywood 10. Next, they produced a radio broadcast, “<a href=\"https://anotheroldmovieblog.blogspot.com/2017/11/hollywood-fights-back-radio-protest.html\">Hollywood Fights Back</a>,” as a defense of the rights of Americans to write, produce, act in and see whatever movies they pleased.</p>\n\n<p>The committee released an initial statement with <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/docsteach.org/wp-content/uploads/documents/25466014/orig_25466014_27190.jpg?fit=1798%2C2500&amp;ssl=1\">35 signatories</a>. A few months later, it published a pamphlet with more than 300 additional names supporting the effort.</p>\n\n<h2>Purging Hollywood</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve never heard of that committee, or if you only learned about it recently when the new version made headlines, you’re not alone. The group fizzled out almost as quickly as it had mobilized.</p>\n\n<p>Bogart, perhaps its most famous member, soon retracted his support for the Hollywood 10, saying in March 1948 that he regretted his trip to Washington. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1948-Humphrey_Bogart_on_Hollywood_Blacklist_editorial#google_vignette\">I’m no Communist</a>,” the “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_in_0_q_humphry%2520bogar\">Casablanca</a>” star declared in a widely circulated statement.</p>\n\n<p>Two crucial developments kneecapped the committee. First, the <a href=\"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/hollywood-10/\">HUAC cited the Hollywood 10 for contempt of Congress</a>. They were later tried in court and convicted of that crime. They eventually served prison time.</p>\n\n<p>Also, studio executives drafted new hiring policies for the movie industry. Later known as the “<a href=\"https://cinemahistoryonline.com/tag/waldorf-declaration/\">Waldorf declaration</a>” because the meeting took place in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, the studio heads announced that the Hollywood 10 would be fired and banned from any studio, and that all the studios would agree to fire and ban any known communists.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next decade, hundreds more stars and other key players in the entertainment industry were <a href=\"https://shepherd.com/best-books/hollywood-blacklist\">fired, purged and blacklisted</a> in what became known as the blacklist era.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/about-us/faculty/bios/kathy-newman.html\">professor of English and film studies</a>, and I’m writing a book about <a href=\"https://guides.library.ucla.edu/filmcensorship/blacklist\">progressive films made during those years</a>. The original committee’s members were mainly leftists and liberals whose careers survived the political pressures to root them out of show business.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee for the First Amendment ultimately failed to protect the Hollywood 10 from professional attacks or incarceration, nor did it prevent hundreds of others from being blacklisted.</p>\n\n<h2>Bad timing</h2>\n\n<p>But I don’t believe that the original Committee for the First Amendment was destined to fail.</p>\n\n<p>The Hollywood 10’s legal strategy, rooted in the First Amendment, reflected the hope that their convictions might be eventually overturned by the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p>Unluckily, however, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/justices/frank-murphy/\">Frank Murphy</a> and <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/justices/wiley-blount-rutledge/\">Wiley Blount Rutledge</a>, two of the court’s most liberal justices, died before the appeal of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/07/22/hollywood-ten-contempt-congress-bannon/\">first two Hollywood 10 convictions</a> could reach them.</p>\n\n<p>After President Harry Truman replaced them, the <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,812216,00.html\">Supreme Court</a> declined to hear the appeals. Most of the Hollywood 10 served prison sentences between 1950 and 1951. </p>\n\n<h2>Why bother?</h2>\n\n<p>Given that the Committee for the First Amendment failed to protect Hollywood from conservative repression in the 1940s and 1950s, why would anyone revive it?</p>\n\n<p>One reason is that there are parallels between the blacklist era and today.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Trump administration is trying to get comedians who poke fun at him kicked off the air, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/01/media/jimmy-kimmel-stephen-colbert\">talk show host Jimmy Kimmel</a> being temporarily pulled off the air.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood has also seen a surge in labor organizing. Many members of the new Committee for the First Amendment were on the front lines of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/with-the-end-of-the-hollywood-writers-and-actors-strikes-the-creator-economy-is-the-next-frontier-for-organized-labor-217657\">screenwriters and actors strikes of 2023</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, this fight is arguably worth waging. Most Americans see the First Amendment as enshrining valuable rights. An October 2025 <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/\">Marist poll found that 4 in 5 Americans</a> think the U.S. is restricting First Amendment freedoms too much. </p>\n\n<p>Americans still debate whether or not it was right to fire and blacklist Hollywood’s suspected communists. While many <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvc6IacExI\">see the HUAC hearings as a travesty</a>, <a href=\"https://newideal.aynrand.org/why-rand-was-right-to-testify-against-hollywood-communism/\">others defend the House committee</a> and the anti-communist fervor that inspired it.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_xSdoWt7v0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">‘The Pajama Game,’ a hit movie made in the 1950s, featured a fight by workers for higher pay.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Resilience and silence</h2>\n\n<p>Many look at the blacklist era as a time of capitulation by progressives in the face of repression. While there’s some validity to these claims, I’ve found that many progressive filmmakers also banded together, using allegory and other creative techniques to make movies with progressive – sometimes radical – messages.</p>\n\n<p>Take “The Pajama Game,” for example. It’s a musical comedy about labor trouble in a pajama factory. While the film is a sexy, frothy romp, on the one hand, the film also casts Doris Day as Babe, a feisty union steward. In “Racing with the Clock,” workers sing about the pressure they feel to speed up the pace of their labor.</p>\n\n<p>Scenes include workers organizing a slowdown, sabotaging machinery and going on strike. The last word spoken in the film is “solidarity.”</p>\n\n<p>To me, the revival of the Committee for the First Amendment draws attention to the dangers implicit in efforts to muzzle writers, artists and filmmakers.</p>\n\n<p>“Silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice the people have,” the actress <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000031/\">Katharine Hepburn</a> said in May 1947 in a speech <a href=\"https://thegreatkh.blogspot.com/2012/06/hepburn-and-anti-huac-brigade.html\">written for her by Dalton Trumbo</a>, one of the Hollywood 10. “Destroy culture and you destroy one of the strongest sources of inspiration from which a people can draw strength to fight for a better life.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266751/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kathy M.

      "content": "<p>In today’s hot housing market, winning a bidding war can feel like a triumph. But my research shows <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5399525\">it often comes with a catch</a>: Homebuyers who win bidding wars tend to experience a “winner’s curse,” systematically overpaying for their new homes.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.steve-sh-choi.com\">a real estate economist</a>, and my colleagues and I analyzed nearly 14 million home sales in 30 U.S. states over roughly two decades. We found that people who paid more than the asking price for their homes – a reliable sign of a bidding war – were more likely to default on their mortgages and saw significantly weaker returns.</p>\n\n<p>How much weaker? On average, homebuyers who won bidding wars saw annual returns that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than those who didn’t, we found. We specifically looked at “unlevered” returns – basically, the returns you’d get if you bought the home outright with cash, without factoring in a mortgage. </p>\n\n<p>Since the typical homeowner in our sample held a property for 6.3 years before selling it, this translates to about an 8.2% overpayment. Bidding-war winners were also 1.9 percentage points likelier to default.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps that loss would be worth it to someone who absolutely loves the property – but we found that homebuyers who purchase after a bidding war are also faster to resell. This suggests their overpayment is based less on enduring affection and more on bidding-war fever.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that the effects of the winner’s curse – lower home appreciation and higher default rates – are stronger in places where bidding wars are more common. One example is my hometown of Rochester, New York, which has become a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-to-rochester-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-2021-7\">bidding-war hot spot</a> in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Who bears the brunt? Lower-income, Black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to overpay in bidding wars, we found, making them more likely to suffer from the winner’s curse. This suggests that hot housing markets can worsen inequality.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>While housing is the largest single form of wealth Americans own, past research on the winner’s curse mostly dealt with land auctions and company mergers – not the nation’s roughly <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B25032?t=Units+and+Stories+in+Structure\">76 million owner-occupied, single-family homes</a>. Our work is the first to show the direct evidence of the winner’s curse in residential housing markets. </p>\n\n<p>This matters now because the housing market is cooling. Those who bought in the post-pandemic housing market and listed their homes in 2025 are already facing <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/selling-at-a-loss-2025/\">the risk of selling at a loss</a>. Because this risk falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic homebuyers, it could further widen the wealth gap. </p>\n\n<p>By one measure, foreclosures are up <a href=\"https://www.homes.com/news/foreclosure-rates-rise-nationwide/325546485/\">18% year over year</a>. If the brunt of these losses falls on lower-income or otherwise vulnerable homeowners, the result could be an increase in housing insecurity and homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that the winner’s curse may be preventable.

That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/geothermal-investment-soars-85-as-breakthrough-tech-unlocks-500-gw-us-potential/\">US$1.7 billion</a> in public funding – <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/geothermal-investment-soars-85-as-breakthrough-tech-unlocks-500-gw-us-potential/\">compared with $2 billion for all of 2024</a>, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eaaEUuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">exploration geophysicist and energy engineer</a>, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.</p>\n\n<p>A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/enhanced-geothermal-systems-great-basin-could-supply-10-us-electricity\">as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation</a> – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/technology-breakthroughs-are-unlocking-geothermal-energys-vast-potential-in-countries-across-the-globe\">15% of the world’s electricity needs</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two people stand near a large container of shucked corn while steam billows from a pool of water behind them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">For generations, Maori people in New Zealand, and other people elsewhere around the world, have made use of the Earth’s heat, as in hot springs, where these people are cooking food in the hot water.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/new-zealand-rotorua-whakarewarewa-thermal-area-maori-women-news-photo/454200824\">Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why geothermal energy is unique</h2>\n\n<p>Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, <a href=\"https://geothermal.org/our-impact/blog/public-health-benefits-geothermal\">providing consistent, reliable power</a> with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.</p>\n\n<p>Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/utahs-hottest-new-power-source-is-below-the-ground\">deliver 100 megawatts</a> of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of <a href=\"https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/power-plants-average-capacities/\">power generated by the average coal plant</a> in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.</p>\n\n<p>But the project, <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-breaks-ground-on-the-worlds-largest-next-gen-geothermal-project/\">estimated to cost $1.1 billion</a>, is not complete. When <a href=\"https://energycapitalhtx.com/fervo-cape-station-funding\">complete in 2028</a>, the station is projected to deliver <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/\">500 megawatts of electricity</a>. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/\">various technical improvements</a> since the project broke ground.</p>\n\n<p>And geothermal energy is becoming <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wind-and-solar-energy-are-cheaper-than-electricity-from-fossil-fuel-plants/\">economically competitive</a>. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/fe8d11b6-b1a6-43d9-9351-47d86ed1dfbc/TheFutureofGeothermal.pdf\">as little as $50 per megawatt-hour</a>, a price <a href=\"https://www.pv-tech.org/us-utility-scale-solar-pv-lcoe-tightens-to-us38-78-mwh-in-2025-lazard/\">competitive with other renewable sources</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of geothermal energy</h2>\n\n<p>There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-power-plants.php\">Hydrothermal systems</a></strong> tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/detail/features/2023/full-steam-ahead-unearthing-the-power-of-geothermal\">geologically active areas</a> where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>Some hydrothermal facilities, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-8252(91)90018-B\">Larderello in Italy</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/hydrothermal-resources\">operated for over a century</a>, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in <a href=\"https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2014/Sepulveda.pdf\">New Zealand</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/historical-overview-on-geothermal-at-the-geysers-california/\">U.S.</a> have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large yellow vehicle with a tall tower on it stands in front of a house.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A drilling rig sits outside a home in White Plains, N.Y., where a geothermal heat pump is being installed.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateSchoolsHeatPumps/6e19fccaaa2b4b4fabbfe17c313f2332/photo\">AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced geothermal systems</strong> effectively <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/electric-power-and-natural-gas/our-insights/is-geothermal-energy-ready-to-make-its-mark-in-the-us-power-mix\">create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes</a> just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1085112/enhanced-geothermal-systems-renewable-energy-drilling-breakthrough-technologies\">hydraulic fracturing</a> for oil and gas production. </p>\n\n<p>A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems\">dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground source heat pumps</strong> do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just <a href=\"https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-ground-loop-frequently-asked-questions\">6 or</a> <a href=\"https://robonrenovations.blogspot.com/2013/09/how-deep-are-pipes-of-ground-source.html\">8 feet down</a> (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter <a href=\"https://makenergy.com/ground-source-heat-pump-borehole-guide/\">hundreds of feet lower</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/guide_to_geothermal_heat_pumps.pdf\">more efficient than</a> <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/air-source-heat-pumps\">air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits</a>, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even <a href=\"https://igshpa.org/wp-content/uploads/12-Commercial-District-Energy-Systems-Brian-Urlaub.pdf\">neighborhood or business developments</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Direct-use applications</strong> also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. <a href=\"https://www.wbdg.org/resources/geothermal-energy-direct-use\">Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops</a>; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101915\">100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity</a>. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/CEC-500-2020-020.pdf\">lithium concentrations in the groundwater</a> of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially <a href=\"https://transform.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lithium-and-Geothermal-Resources.pdf\">supply battery manufacturers</a>. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as <a href=\"https://calexicochronicle.com/2025/09/16/battle-over-salton-sea-lithium-project-heads-to-appeals-court/\">legal challenges to it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/heated-volcanic-rocks-store-energy\">underground rock formations</a> to <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/storing-energy-underground-reservoir-thermal-energy-storage-shows-promise/\">store energy as heat</a> when consumer demand is low and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2025.115761\">use it to produce electricity</a> when demand rises.</p>\n\n<p>Some geothermal power stations can <a href=\"https://research-hub.nrel.gov/en/publications/techno-economic-viability-of-flexible-dispatch-of-unconventional-?\">adjust their output to meet demand</a>, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. <a href=\"https://jpt.spe.org/the-multiple-facets-and-versatility-of-geothermal-energy\">Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources</a> and battery storage are increasing the <a href=\"https://geothermal.org/our-impact/blog/geothermal-hybrid-renewable-systems\">reliability of above-ground renewable power</a> <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/this-texas-geothermal-startup-is-storing-energy-in-the-ground\">in Texas</a>, among other places.</p>\n\n<p>And geothermal energy can power <a href=\"https://jpt.spe.org/the-multiple-facets-and-versatility-of-geothermal-energy\">clean hydrogen production</a> as well as energy-intensive efforts to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture\">physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a>, as is <a href=\"https://energydigital.com/news/why-iceland-is-the-global-climate-tech-capital\">happening in Iceland</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram shows pipes extending down from the surface of the ground, pushing cold water into hot rocks below, and drawing hot water back up.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Enhanced geothermal systems can be built almost anywhere and can take advantage of existing wells to save the time and money of drilling new holes deep into the ground.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/geothermal-schematicpng\">U.S. Geological Survey</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, the U.S. has <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/\">about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity</a>, mostly in the West. That’s <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3\">about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production</a>, but the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/its-a-hot-topic-geothermal-energy-and-how-usgs-science-could-help-harness-it\">amount of available energy is much larger</a>, according to federal and international engineering assessments.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enss.2025.01.004\">converting abandoned oil and gas wells</a> for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread. </p>\n\n<p>One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah.

This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and <a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/10161/32310\">environmental disruption</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/wells-opportunity\">accelerates deployment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are as many as <a href=\"https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/abandoned-oil-gas-wells/\">4 million abandoned oil and gas wells</a> across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2024.100797\">opportunities for clean energy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Challenges and trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p>Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://paceventures.com/articles/geothermal-the-hottest-underground-movement-in-energy\">Drilling is expensive</a>, and conventional systems need <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48090\">specific geological conditions</a>. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, <a href=\"https://energy.sustainability-directory.com/question/what-challenges-does-egs-deployment-present\">risk causing earthquakes</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-energy-and-the-environment.php\">Overall emissions are low</a> from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/hydrogen-sulfide-and-health\">corrosive gas that is toxic to humans</a> and can contribute to <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/resources/environmental-impacts-geothermal-energy\">respiratory irritation</a>. But <a href=\"https://sites.lafayette.edu/egrs352-sp14-geothermal/contexts-and-consequences/environmental-pollutants/\">modern geothermal plants use abatement systems</a> that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>And the systems do use water, though <a href=\"https://bkvenergy.com/learning-center/environmental-impact-of-geothermal-energy/\">closed-loop systems</a> can minimize consumption.</p>\n\n<p>Building geothermal power stations does require <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-energy-raises-capital-to-drive-geothermal-development/\">significant investment</a>, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can <a href=\"https://courses.ems.psu.edu/earth104/node/1303\">offset many of these costs</a>. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/fervo-energy-raises-over-200-million-to-build-u-s-geothermal-energy-project\">government subsidies are no longer necessary</a> for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266555/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Moones Alamooti does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Our findings, published in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2025.103069\">Journal of Health Economics</a>, show that minor physical health conditions like mild seasonal allergies, previously thought not to be an immediate trigger of suicide, are indeed a risk factor. </p>\n\n<p>To evaluate the link between seasonal allergies and suicide, my co-authors and I combined daily pollen measurements with daily suicide counts across 34 U.S. metropolitan areas. </p>\n\n<p>Because both pollen and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00104-3\">suicide are sensitive to weather conditions</a>, we carefully accounted for temperature, rainfall and wind. We also controlled for differences in local climate and plant life, since pollen levels vary by region, and for seasonal averages that might otherwise obscure results. This allowed us to compare suicide counts on days with unexpectedly high pollen to days with little or none in the same county.</p>\n\n<p>The results were striking. Relative to days with no or low levels of pollen, we found that deaths by suicide rose by 5.5% when pollen levels are moderate and 7.4% when levels are high. The increase was even larger among people with a known history of mental health conditions or treatment. We also showed that on high-pollen days, residents of affected areas experience more depressive symptoms and exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis suggests that allergies exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing some people toward crisis. We suspect that sleep disruption is the link between allergies and suicide rates.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db460.htm\">80 million Americans experience seasonal allergies</a> each year. </p>\n\n<p>Symptoms include sneezing, congestion, itchy eyes and scratchy throat. Most people experiencing these symptoms feel sluggish during the day and sleep poorly at night. Allergy sufferers might not realize, however, that these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.01483.x\">symptoms reduce alertness and cognitive functioning</a> – some of the factors that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.033\">can worsen mental health</a> and increase vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>Suicide rates have been growing steadily in the past two decades, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html\">by 37% between 2000 and 2018</a>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm\">49,000 Americans died by suicide in 2022</a>, and over 616,000 visited emergency departments for self-harm injuries. </p>\n\n<p>Although socioeconomic and demographic factors are the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22526\">most important predictors of suicide</a>, much less is known about its short-term triggers. Our study adds to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3386/w30626\">growing evidence that the environment</a> – including something as natural as pollen – can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2221621120\">influence mental health risks</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>This issue is likely to become more urgent as the climate changes. Rising temperatures <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28764-0\">lengthen pollen seasons and increase pollen volume</a>. Over the past two decades, pollen seasons <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/allergy-season-is-getting-more-intense-with-climate-change-were-creating-better-pollen-forecasts-to-help-203881\">have grown in both intensity and duration</a>, and projections suggest they will <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/worsening-allergies-arent-your-imagination-windy-days-create-the-perfect-pollen-storm-2546\">continue to worsen</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That means more people will experience stronger allergy symptoms, with ripple effects not only for physical health but also for sleep, mood and mental well-being.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"3-dimensional illustration of a variety of pollen grain types being transported through the air.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Higher temperatures from climate change contribute to more pollen in the air for longer periods of time during pollen seasons.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pollen-grains-which-can-trigger-allergies-are-royalty-free-image/1758572496?phrase=pollen%20grains%20allergy%20season&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Christoph Burgstedt/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What we still don’t know</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the scale of the problem, there are no national systems in the U.S. to consistently measure and communicate pollen levels. Most communities lack reliable forecasts and alert systems that would allow vulnerable people to take precautions. This gap limits both prevention and research.</p>\n\n<p>Our study focused on metropolitan areas where pollen and death counts were available, but we cannot yet generalize to rural areas. That is a concern because rural communities often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00369\">face greater shortages in mental health care</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/haschl/qxae035\">pharmacy access</a> – and have seen <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6618a1.htm\">rising suicide rates over the past decade</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>For people who are already receiving mental health care, recognizing and treating seasonal allergies is a key part of self-care. </p>\n\n<p>Over-the-counter medications can be <a href=\"https://secure.medicalletter.org/TML-article-1725a\">highly effective at reducing symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>More broadly, people should be aware that during peak allergy season, reduced alertness, sleep disruptions and mood fluctuations may place an increased burden on their mental health, in addition to the allergy symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of policy, improving pollen monitoring and public communication could help people anticipate high-risk days. Such infrastructure would also support further research, particularly in rural areas where data is currently lacking. Our next step, supported by the <a href=\"https://supporting.afsp.org/home\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</a>, is to examine the impact of pollen on rural communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266459/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shooshan Danagoulian receives funding from American Foundation of Suicide Prevention.</span></em></p>",

This includes much of the day-to-day work done by federal information technology and cybersecurity employees, including those at the nation’s leading civilian cybersecurity agency, the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>. </p>\n\n<p>CISA is among the entities that will see the deepest staffing reductions during the shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, according to Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/09/most-dhs-employees-will-continue-working-through-shutdown/\">documentation</a>. Only about one-third of its employees remain on the job after federal employees were furloughed. As if cybersecurity wasn’t challenging enough, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-government-shutdown-plan-employees/761365/\">fewer CISA employees</a> are being asked to do more and more work protecting American cyberspace during the shutdown. And they’ll be working with the promise of getting paid for their efforts at some date in the future once the shutdown ends.</p>\n\n<p>The current CISA situation is grim, from my vantage point as a <a href=\"http://www.csee.umbc.edu/%7Erforno/\">cybersecurity researcher</a> and former industry practitioner. The agency was already experiencing <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-departures-trump-workforce-purge/749796/\">deep cuts to its staff</a> and resources before the shutdown. And now, coinciding with the shutdown, a key law that enabled the agency to facilitate information-sharing with the private sector <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">has expired</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, the cyberdefense agency is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/02/cisa-shutdown-cybersecurity/\">being hobbled</a> at a time when the need for its services has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">never been greater</a>, from the ongoing China-led <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-salt-typhoon-a-security-expert-explains-the-chinese-hackers-and-their-attack-on-us-telecommunications-networks-244473\">Salt Typhoon</a> attack on U.S. telecommunications networks to ransomware, data breaches and threats to infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>CISA was created in 2007 within the Department of Homeland Security. As its name implies, the agency is charged with <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/about\">digital security matters</a> across the federal government. The agency also works with the companies that operate and secure the numerous critical infrastructure sectors of the American economy, such as phone networks, the electric grid and energy pipelines. Additionally, it <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/state-local-governments-cisa-changes-2025-kristi-noem/\">helps state and local governments</a> across the country secure their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/local-governments-are-attractive-targets-for-hackers-and-are-ill-prepared-179073\">vulnerable</a> networks and data.</p>\n\n<p>CISA also publishes threat and vulnerability alerts for the government and cybersecurity community and engages with public and private stakeholders on best practices in response to emerging vulnerabilities. Prior to the recent expiration of the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>, the agency also made it easier for organizations to share useful information with the government to help cybersecurity teams better protect their systems.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4Q5hFykarQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Shutdown-mandated furloughs at the nation’s cybersecurity agency present an opportunity for malicious hackers.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political football</h2>\n\n<p>The agency takes a nonpartisan approach to cybersecurity matters. However, some politicians have accused the agency of political bias for its work helping states protect their voting infrastructure from cyberattacks and external influence. Specifically, the agency was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/14/934220380/as-trump-pushes-election-falsehoods-his-cybersecurity-agency-pushes-back\">repeatedly maligned</a> for calling the 2020 election the “most secure” in history. For some in elected office, this work on election security has tarnished CISA’s reputation and perhaps explains recent <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/cisa-congress-budget-workforce-cuts\">budgetary actions</a> taken against the agency.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, nearly 1,000 CISA employees <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/06/03/cisa-staff-layoffs-resignations-trump-cuts\">have departed</a> the agency through voluntary buyouts or deferred resignations. By the end of May 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-senior-official-departures/748992/\">nearly all of CISA’s senior leadership</a> had resigned or had announced plans to do so.</p>\n\n<p>For 2026, the president’s draft budget proposes to reduce CISA’s head count by nearly one-third, <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2025/05/dhs-budget-request-would-cut-cisa-staff-by-1000-positions/\">dramatically cutting</a> staff from its risk management and stakeholder engagement divisions. Other cuts will significantly reduce the agency’s collaboration activities and funding for CISA’s various cybersecurity education and training programs.</p>\n\n<p>Making the problem worse, the government shutdown began at the same time that Congress failed to renew the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>. This law provided a <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-case-for-reauthorizing-cisa-2015\">legal shield</a> that allowed companies and infrastructure operators to share timely and often sensitive information with CISA about the cyberattacks, vulnerabilities and incidents that they were encountering. </p>\n\n<p>In the wake of the law’s expiration, prudent companies may consider restricting what information they share with the government. Without the indemnification provided by CISA, many companies will likely have their legal teams review any information to be shared with the government. And that takes time. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adversaries do not reduce their <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/10/cyber-threats-abound-as-trump-guts-cyber-agencies-00284735\">attacks against the U.S.</a> based on available federal cyber defense funding or the status of cybersecurity laws. In fact, malicious hackers often strike when their target’s guard is down.</p>\n\n<h2>Charting a better course</h2>\n\n<p>Early in my career I had to work through a prolonged government shutdown. I’ve also participated in and developed assorted public-private information-sharing environments to exchange intelligence and analysis on cyber- and national security matters. And having been in the D.C. area for over 30 years, I’ve seen how government works. So I have a good idea of what’s needed to improve American cybersecurity. The following suggestions are a starting point.</p>\n\n<p>First, Congress could ensure that critical security agencies such as CISA are <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/03/congress-needs-to-shutdown-proof-cisa/\">immune from the threat</a> of recurring federal government shutdowns. If it desired, Congress could set budgets for America’s security agencies on a <a href=\"https://www.cagw.org/federal-budget-in-dire-need-of-reform/\">biennial basis</a> – as 16 states <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/fiscal/fy-2025-state-budget-status\">already do</a> for their entire budgets.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of cybersecurity funding, the White House’s proposed 2026 budget reduces research and education on cybersecurity. For example, the nation’s premiere federal cybersecurity <a href=\"https://sfs.opm.gov/\">scholarship program</a> to recruit, educate and place future federal cybersecurity workers <a href=\"https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\">would be reduced by over 60%</a>. Protecting this funding would allow CISA and the federal government to maintain the pipeline for a robust and capable cybersecurity workforce both today and into the future.</p>\n\n<p>Companies could develop new or expand existing nongovernmental information-sharing networks that are not completely dependent on the government to facilitate or fund, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/\">Cyber Threat Alliance</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/\">Center for Internet Security</a>. Cybersecurity relies on trust. But right now, the instability of the federal government makes it difficult to rely on any entity under its policy or funding influence, no matter how well <a href=\"https://sei.cmu.edu/divisions/cert/\">time-tested and trusted</a>.

When doctors use genetics, it’s usually to try to identify a disease-causing gene to help guide diagnosis and treatment. But for most health conditions, the genetics is far more complicated than how clinicians are currently looking at it in diagnosis, counseling and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Your DNA carries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15393\">millions of genetic variants</a> you inherit from your parents or develop by chance. Some are common variants, shared by many people. Others are rare variants, found in very few people or even unique to a family. Together, these variants shape who you are – from visible traits such as height or eye color to health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.</p>\n\n<p>In our newly published research in the journal Cell, my team and I found that a genetic mutation involved in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">affected by multiple other genetic variants</a>, changing how these conditions develop. Our findings support the idea that, rather than focusing on single genes, taking the whole genome into account would provide insight into how researchers understand what makes someone genetically predisposed to certain diseases and how those diseases develop.</p>\n\n<h2>Primary and secondary variants</h2>\n\n<p>Certain rare variants can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK132154/\">cause problems on their own</a>, such as the genetic mutations that cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. But in many cases, whether someone actually develops symptoms of disease depends on what else is happening across the genome. </p>\n\n<p>While a primary variant might trigger a disease, secondary variants can alter how that disease develops and progresses. Think of it like a song: The melody (primary variant) is the main part of the song, but the bassist and drummer (secondary variants) can change its groove and rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why two people with the same genetic mutation can seem so different. One person might have severe symptoms, another person mild symptoms, and another none at all. These variations can even occur within the same family. This phenomenon, called <a href=\"https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Biology_for_Majors_I_(Lumen)/14%3A_Module_12-_Trait_Inheritance/14.12%3A_Penetrance_and_Expressivity\">variable expressivity</a>, arises from differences in the secondary variants a person has. In most cases, these variants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-018-0266-3\">amplify the effects</a> of the primary mutation. A higher number of secondary variants on top of a primary variant generally leads to more severe disease.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0XYWKm_LoM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Mutations are a source of genetic variation.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a primary variant and a secondary variant together can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1516767\">cause two different disorders</a> in the same person, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.38315\">Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome</a>. Other times, secondary variants have no obvious effect on their own but together can tip the balance of whether and how a disease will appear, even in the absence of a primary variant. This can be seen in the development of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.10.013\">heart disease in children</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Insights from a missing piece of a chromosome</h2>\n\n<p>My team and I studied a genetic change known as a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274565/\">16p12.1 deletion</a>, where a small piece of chromosome 16 is missing. Researchers have linked this mutation to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.534\">developmental delay, intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions</a> such as schizophrenia. Yet most children inherit this genetic variant from a parent who has milder symptoms, different symptoms or sometimes no symptoms at all.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why this happens, we analyzed 442 individuals from 124 families carrying this genetic mutation. We found that children lacking this piece of chromosome 16 had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more secondary variants</a> elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents. These secondary variants took many forms, including both small changes and large deletions, duplications and expansions of their DNA.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two types of chromosomal mutations include deletion and duplication.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.611379\">Gandawijaya et al./Biorender via Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Each type of secondary variant was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">associated with different health outcomes</a>. Some were linked to smaller head size and reduced cognitive function, while others contributed to higher rates of psychiatric or developmental symptoms. This suggests that while a 16p12.1 deletion makes the genome more sensitive to neurodevelopmental disorders, which symptoms manifest depends on which other variants are present.</p>\n\n<p>The story gets even more complex when considering the fact that children not only inherit a 16p12.1 deletion from one parent but also inherit secondary variants from both parents.</p>\n\n<p>My team and I found that the symptoms of the parent with this genetic mutation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">often match those of their spouse</a>. For example, a parent with a 16p12.1 deletion who shows signs of anxiety or depression is more likely to have a partner who also has these symptoms. This pattern, called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-dont-mate-randomly-but-the-flawed-assumption-that-they-do-is-an-essential-part-of-many-studies-linking-genes-to-diseases-and-traits-194793\">assortative mating</a>, means that when parents with overlapping genetic risks have children, those risks can combine and accumulate. </p>\n\n<p>Over generations, this stacking of secondary variants can lead to children who have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">more severe symptoms</a> than their parents. </p>\n\n<h2>Biases in genetics research</h2>\n\n<p>One reason why scientific understanding of secondary variants has lagged is that genetic research often depends on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0467-5\">who is recruited to participate</a> in these studies and how researchers recruit them.</p>\n\n<p>Most studies recruit patients affected with a particular disease. Families recruited from genetic clinics typically have children with severe versions of the disease. But if studies focus only on patients with the most acute symptoms, researchers may overestimate the effects of primary variants and miss the subtler role that secondary variants may play in how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>But if researchers were to study people drawn from the general population – say, by recruiting people from a large shopping mall – some might carry the same primary variant but have far milder symptoms or none at all. This variability allows researchers to better dissect how different parts of the genome interact with each other and affect how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>In our study, for example, we found that people with a 16p12.1 deletion who were recruited from the general population often had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">milder symptoms and different patterns</a> of secondary variants compared to those who were recruited in a clinic.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person in white coat pipetting a sample into a vial, a DNA readout on a screen in the backdrop\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Who’s included in genetics research influences how scientists understand disease.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/scientist-pipetting-sample-into-a-vial-for-dna-royalty-free-image/1334095553\">Cavan Images/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Embracing complexity in genetics</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of a deterministic view where one mutation equals one outcome, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more complex model</a> accounts for the fact that whether and how a disease develops depends on the interplay between different genetic variants and environment. This has implications for how genetics is used in the clinic.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, a child who tests positive for a genetic variant might be diagnosed with a disease tied to that mutation. In the future, doctors might also examine the child’s broader genetic profile to better predict their developmental trajectory, psychiatric risk or response to therapies. Families could be counseled with a more realistic picture of their child’s probability of developing a disease, rather than assuming every person with the same genetic variant will share the same outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The science is still emerging. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncovering-the-genetic-basis-of-mental-illness-requires-data-and-tools-that-arent-just-based-on-white-people-this-international-team-is-collecting-dna-samples-around-the-globe-185997\">Larger and more diverse datasets</a> and models that can better capture the subtle effects of genetic variants and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-your-genes-interact-with-your-environment-changes-your-disease-risk-new-research-counts-the-ways-252139\">environmental factors</a> are still needed.

Lewis</a>, whom many consider one of the most important labor leaders of the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p>Roberts has seen the union through an especially difficult period for the coal industry and grew up immersed in it. He was <a href=\"https://umwa.org/about/leadership/cecil-e-roberts/\">raised in Cabin Creek</a>, West Virginia, where <a href=\"https://wvpublic.org/story/radio/sept-28-1955-labor-activist-mother-blizzard-dies/\">his great-grandmother</a> – an activist in her own right – let miners camp on her property during a legendary strike in 1912.

Let me hear you say, ‘Fired up!’”</p>\n\n<p>Capping off the rousing call-and-response, he shouted, “God bless all of you, you’re the salt of the earth!”</p>\n\n<p>Roberts’ style is a glimpse into a bigger story. For over a century, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2021.100990\">coal has transformed central Appalachia</a>: from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-violent-remaking-of-appalachia/474603/\">the shape of the landscape</a> to <a href=\"https://npshistory.com/publications/nha/national-coal/survey.pdf\">place names</a>, and from <a href=\"https://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu/content/music-and-coal-activism-perspectives-field\">folk music</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWlmSGIFlP8\">crafts</a> to economic conditions.</p>\n\n<p>All the while, religion has been transforming in the mountains, too. Labor and religion are deeply entangled here – a subject <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/faculty-listing/detail/callahan\">I explored</a> in my book “<a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">Work and Faith in the Kentucky Coal Fields: Subject to Dust</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>‘Railroad religion’</h2>\n\n<p>In the 1880s, two groups rushed into the central Appalachian Mountains: industrialists <a href=\"https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/entries/1301\">seeking coal</a>, and missionaries <a href=\"https://collections.library.appstate.edu/research-aids/home-missions-movement-appalachia\">seeking moral reform</a>. Both changed the region forever, and their stories were intertwined. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, central Appalachia was widely depicted in the popular press as a backward, ignorant region whose mountainous terrain kept its people isolated, outside the flow of progress – <a href=\"https://eberly.wvu.edu/news-events/eberly-news/2017/06/12/the-h-word-fighting-negative-language-stereotypes-in-appalachia\">a stereotype still common today</a>. Equating economic progress with moral progress, many Americans assumed that developing industry would lift people out of what they perceived as fatalism and superstition. </p>\n\n<p>The coal industry used this idea to promote its rapid exploitation of mountain resources. Companies built railroads to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57780-3_1\">connect the region to the national market</a>, developed industrial coal mines and reshaped the central Appalachian economy. <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&amp;context=wlufac\">Missionaries opened churches</a>, schools and camps.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo of a settlement on a small hill along a river.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Henry Ford founded Twin Branch, W.Va. – shown here in the 1920s – as a town for coal miners.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/henry-ford-a-coal-mine-owner-and-operator-here-is-a-news-photo/515208302?adppopup=true\">Bettmann via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Company-owned <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/minewars-coalcamps/\">coal towns</a> encompassed miners’ lives. People who had long farmed for themselves and lived, as the Bible told them to, “<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&amp;version=KJV\">by the sweat of their brow</a>,” became dependent upon coal companies as mine development shrank the size of family farms. Not only did employers own the miners’ houses, but they also <a href=\"https://www.appalachianhistory.net/2018/09/company-store-scrip.html\">paid workers in “scrip</a>,” which was redeemable only at the company store. </p>\n\n<p>Many company towns included theaters, offered films and music, and even built churches and paid pastors’ salaries. These were typically mainline Protestant churches, such as Methodist or Presbyterian.</p>\n\n<p>To some Appalachian natives, these denominations <a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">were known as “railroad religion</a>” because of the way they entered the mountains. And, for many miners, these were the churches of management. When there was labor unrest, the coal town churches tended to side with the companies, advising miners against strikes or agitation. </p>\n\n<h2>Faith and action</h2>\n\n<p>The churches of most miners born in central Appalachia, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p064142\">were in the mountain communities</a> – independent Baptist or <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Holiness-movement\">Holiness congregations</a> whose pastors were usually miners themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Pastors preached about the dangers and sacrifices miners faced deep underground, in an age of few regulations. God was <a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">on the side of the oppressed and downtrodden</a>, they stressed – and those who gained at others’ expense would ultimately face divine judgment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their passionate preaching was meant to inspire action, whether it was committing one’s life to Jesus or to the union. Labor rights were deeply understood as religious issues, rooted in Christian concerns for justice and care.</p>\n\n<p>John Sayles’ <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093509/\">1987 film “Matewan</a>” powerfully depicted the divided role that religion played in West Virginia’s coalfields. One preacher, played by Sayles, equates the union with “the Prince of Darkness.” Another, a young miner, advocates in biblical terms for the union’s righteousness and helps to lead a strike. The result was the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/matewan-massacre.htm\">Matewan Massacre</a> of 1920: a bloody battle between miners and armed guards hired by the mine owners.</p>\n\n<p>Miner preachers and independent churches were central to the organization of miners in eastern Kentucky in the 1930s, too, during <a href=\"https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeMoments/moments14RS/web/legislative%20moment%2046.pdf\">another period of violence</a> between mine operators and miners over conditions, wages and unionization. It was during this time that miner’s wife and singer Sarah Ogan Gunning penned “<a href=\"https://www.folkstreams.net/films/dreadful-memories\">Dreadful Memories</a>,” turning the traditional hymn “Precious Memories” into a visceral depiction of miners’ struggle and a call for unionization:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“Dreadful memories, how they linger,<br>\nHow they ever flood my soul.<br>\nHow the workers and their children<br>\nDied from hunger and from cold.”</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A black and white photo of several men in slacks and shirts standing outside a small white building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C90%2C742%2C417&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Miners in Harlan County, Ky., arrive at the Pentecostal Church of God building for a union meeting in 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lejunior,_Harlan_County,_Kentucky._Miners_arrive_at_the_Pentecostal_Church_of_God_building_for_a_union_meeting_of_P_V_%26_K_Company,_local_UMWA_-_DPLA_-_f8624020281c28df8f910c5d05f81775.tiff\">Department of the Interior/National Archives at College Park via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Looking to the future</h2>\n\n<p>Today, it is still not surprising to find religious – particularly Christian – rhetoric in labor organizing. United Auto Workers President <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/09/uaw-shawn-fain-christian-radicalism-socialism\">Shawn Fain</a> is another example of a union leader whose speeches draw from the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>But the dynamics of religion and class forged by industrial mining have shaped central Appalachia’s culture in lasting ways particular to the coalfields. The history of labor struggle, infused with religious idioms, is a source of identity and values evident in everything from union meetings in churches to prayers on picket lines.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the United Mine Workers of America is focused less on coal itself, which miners know cannot last forever. The union <a href=\"https://umwa.org/about/who-we-represent/\">represents members in other sectors</a>, too, including public employees, manufacturing, health care and employees of the Navajo Nation. It has also focused its work on <a href=\"https://umwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UMWA-Preserving-Coal-Country-2021.pdf\">an equitable transition to renewable energy</a>: one that accounts for the economic, cultural and environmental destruction that a single-industry economy has wreaked on central Appalachia.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black wall with paler silhouettes of men standing along it, positioned above a low stone wall next to the road.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A memorial in Whitesville, W.Va., honors the 29 miners killed in a 2010 explosion in Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch coal mine in nearby Montcoal.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/whitesville-wv-a-wall-of-marble-silhouettes-at-the-upper-news-photo/2169927662?adppopup=true\">Kristian Thacker for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Likewise, the United Mine Workers of America has fought to hold coal companies to their <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/about/leadership/statements/keeping-americas-promise-retired-coal-miners-and-their-families\">pension and health care obligations</a> toward retired and sick miners whose work fueled the country and made companies rich. </p>\n\n<p>And that struggle, Roberts would say, is a religious one as well.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262472/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richard J.

Most states require kindergartners get <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/whoopingcough.html#:%7E\">vaccines for pertussis</a> – that’s whooping cough – and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625#:%7E\">tetanus</a>, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles\">measles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/index.html#:%7E\">mumps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rubella/symptoms-causes/syc-20377310\">rubella</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/index.html\">chickenpox</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For older kids, a booster of the tetanus and pertussis vaccine is typically required, as well as a <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22442-meningococcal-disease\">vaccine for meningococcal</a> disease. </p>\n\n<p>Vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm\">reduce the risk of outbreaks</a> in places where transmission of these diseases is easy. Not only do vaccinations help keep both students and teachers safe, it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.11.003\">encourages overall higher community coverage</a> for these vaccines. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do scientists track the safety of vaccines over time?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> Before vaccines are approved, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/how-developed-approved.html#:%7E\">they undergo rigorous trials</a>. During this process, scientists look at the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, testing it first in small groups to assess safety, then in larger groups to confirm protection and detect uncommon side effects. That process continues <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/about/monitoring.html\">after the vaccine is approved</a>. Those systems continually monitor the safety of vaccines, both here in the U.S. as well as around the world. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the vaccination coverage trends for kindergartners?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> What we have seen is a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html#:%7E\">small downward trend since 2019</a>, the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It slipped from 95% of new kindergartners being up to date on many of their routine vaccines to about 92%. </p>\n\n<p>That’s a small percentage decrease, so a great majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids. But at the same time, anything below our target of 95% for diseases like measles becomes a problem, because that’s below the level that’s needed for what we call <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/herd-immunity.html\">herd immunity</a>, or community immunity. When that happens, it’s not a matter of if, but when, we see an outbreak of these infectious diseases.</p>\n\n<p>And while nationwide rates are important to look at, outbreaks happen <a href=\"https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-05-07/health-officials-high-alert-measles-st-louis-missouri\">at local community levels</a>. For example, earlier this year, an outbreak of measles in West Texas spread rapidly through communities where vaccination rates had slipped <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread\">well below the state average</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>So, the vaccination rate at your own school or community is much more meaningful than what the national vaccination rate is. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do non-medical vaccine exemptions work?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> First, actual medical exemptions are rare, and these occur when the vaccine is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html\">unsafe for the child to receive</a>, like when he or she has a known severe allergic reaction to vaccine ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Non-medical exemptions for vaccines are often for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5863/1551-6776-21.2.104\">religious, personal or philosophical reasons</a>. They have been increasing for the past several years, rising from the range of 1 to 2% <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html\">up to 3.6% in the 2024–25 school year</a>. That’s a small increase, but again, it’s still concerning. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are some parents vaccine hesitant?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> There are multiple reasons. These include misinformation which algorithm-driven echo chambers on social media can <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/vaccine-misinformation-outpaces-efforts-counter-it\">spread at an alarming rate right now</a>. Also, Americans report <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/\">less trust in institutions and experts</a>, and studies have found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2025.1608162\">growing partisanship around vaccines</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, vaccines are <a href=\"https://ysph.yale.edu/research/information-sheets/childhood-vaccinations/\">victims of their own success</a>. They have worked so well that many diseases like polio <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio\">aren’t routinely seen anymore</a>. That might lead a parent to think the risk for their child is so low that the vaccine is not necessary. But the fact is, vaccines are simply holding these diseases at bay. And as vaccination rates drop, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/vaccine-measles-pertussis-health-wellness#:%7E\">these diseases will come back</a> and more kids will be at risk. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for parents?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> The most important thing you can do as a parent is to keep your kids up to date on required vaccines. That includes the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm#:%7E\">annual flu shot</a>. Follow your state’s requirements and current recommendations from trusted sources like the <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and your own personal pediatrician to know which vaccines your child should have.</p>\n\n<p>You also want to reinforce other common sense approaches to keeping your children healthy. Make sure they know <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/most-people-dont-wash-their-hands-properly-heres-how-it-should-be-done-125330\">how to wash their hands properly</a> and that they stay home when they’re sick. Teach them to sneeze and cough into their elbow instead of into their hands – even though doing so <a href=\"https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/health-myth-coughing-into-your-elbow/\">isn’t a perfect solution</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a pediatrician, I love when my families come and talk to me about their concerns. I help them walk through their worries so they can feel more confident that they’re making a truly informed decision that’s in the best interest of their child’s health. </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sciline.org/\">SciLine</a> is a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit that helps journalists include scientific evidence and experts in their news stories.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265555/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Higgins is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

colleges</h2>\n\n<p>TCUs enroll <a href=\"https://educationusa.state.gov/sites/default/files/field_resource_file/tribal_colleges_and_university_information_sheet_final_1_0.pdf\">approximately 30,000 students</a> each year, including some non-Native students. The median annual tuition at <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/university/tribal-colleges\">TCUs is US$3,572</a>, making them more affordable than <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-state\">most other public universities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://pnpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TCU_FactSheet_Feb25.pdf\">35 accredited TCUs</a> across 13 states, including Montana, Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota. All of these schools are nonprofits. </p>\n\n<p>While a single Native tribe sometimes sets up a tribal college, in other cases a consortium of tribes or the federal government helps establish a school. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their differences, tribal colleges and universities all have the same mission of teaching Indigenous history, culture and languages. </p>\n\n<p>All the tribal colleges also offer associate degrees and certifications. Twenty-two of them have only baccalaureate programs, and nine have master’s programs. <a href=\"https://www.navajotech.edu\">Navajo Technical University</a>, a tribal college in Crownpoint, New Mexico, which has the <a href=\"https://www.navajotech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Navajo-Technical-University-Fall-2019-Enrollment-Highlights-Report.pdf\">largest enrollment size</a> of all the TCUs, began offering a first of its kind doctorate program in Diné Studies in 2024. This program focuses on the language, culture and history of the Diné people, also known as Navajo people.</p>\n\n<p>Affordability has always been a consideration when TCUs set tuition and fees, since most are located on rural <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/native-american-reservations-by-state\">American Indian reservations</a> with <a href=\"https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=ballardbrief\">high unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://ncrc.org/racial-wealth-snapshot-native-americans/\">poverty rates</a>, as well as few available jobs. </p>\n\n<p>TCUs keep their tuition relatively low in part because a majority of their <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-federal-funding?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">funding comes from the federal government</a>. They also receive funding from philanthropic organizations.</p>\n\n<p>TCUs also generally have minimal overhead costs, since most students live off-campus and only a handful of these colleges and universities offer on-campus housing. Most TCUs have both in-person and online courses.</p>\n\n<p>While there is no single profile of a TCU student, I found that it is common to encounter a 30-year-old, single mother who works full time while trying to earn a college degree. </p>\n\n<h2>A growth in college enrollment</h2>\n\n<p>In 1968, just <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED281693.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">181 Native Americans</a> graduated from a four-year college. </p>\n\n<p>That same year, the Navajo Nation <a href=\"https://ehillerman.unm.edu/1687#sthash.DW5z2AMG.dpbs\">established the first tribal college</a>, then called the Navajo Community College, in Tsaile, Arizona. This school is now <a href=\"http://www.aihec.org/\">called Diné College</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Several factors prevented most Native American students from attending a college or university. </p>\n\n<p>The cost of college was prohibitive, and many Native American students were also not adequately prepared for college in high school. These students and their families also feared that higher education could force them to assimilate into Western and white culture, and erase their own Native traditions and languages. </p>\n\n<h2>A long political relationship</h2>\n\n<p>When considering this historical context, it is important to understand that Native Americans have a unique relationship with the federal government. </p>\n\n<p>Native Americans largely consider this relationship a political one, bound by the various legal precedents, federal policies and executive orders from the 1800s and onward. <a href=\"https://www.bia.gov/bia/history/IndianLawPolicy\">These orders and policies from the past several hundred years</a> vary, but they often focus on questions of land, assimilation and the political independence of Native tribes. </p>\n\n<p>There are also <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-22588/white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for\">treaties and orders</a> that focus on education and spell out the <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/Policy-Advocacy/CurrentLegDocs/TriballyControlledCollegesAndUniversitiesAssistanceActOf1978.pdf\">federal government’s responsibility</a> to help coordinate and <a href=\"https://www.aihec.org/policy-and-advocacy/executive-branch/\">give money to support tribal education</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 1978, Congress <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/senate-bill/1215\">approved the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act</a>, which recognized tribal colleges as higher education institutions and established that the federal government would regularly help fund these schools. </p>\n\n<p>Alongside the creation of new tribal colleges and universities over the past several decades, more and more Native people living on reservations have graduated from high school and received higher education degrees. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Databook-Third-Edition-2025-09-07-1.pdf\">percentage of Native college graduates</a> rose 125% from 1990 to 2020. While 4.5% of Native students living on reservations received a college degree in 1990, that percentage rose to 10.3% with at least a college degree in 2020, according to findings by Harvard Kennedy School in September 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, unlike the high school trends, Native people still graduate college at a much lower rate than the general American population. </p>\n\n<p>In 1990, 20.3% of all Americans had at least a college degree. In 2020, 34.3% of Americans had <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Databook-Third-Edition-2025-09-07-1.pdf\">a college degree at a minimum</a>, according to the Harvard Kennedy School findings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman smiles at a cat that is resting on a cat bed, in a classroom with people seated nearby.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A professor at Navajo Technical University participates in a veterinary technology program conducted with the Department of Agriculture in 2019 in Crownpoint, N.M.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usdagov/49216628852\">Flickr/U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A lasting impact</h2>\n\n<p>While tribal colleges and universities receive state and federal funding, they are chronically underfunded and often operate in survival mode. In some cases, they lack money to <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/tribal-college-campuses-are-falling-apart-the-u-s-hasnt-fulfilled-its-promise-to-fund-the-schools/\">make needed repairs on campus buildings</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One major reason for this shortfall: While Congress agreed in the late 1970s <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-25/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-41/subpart-B/section-41.29\">to annually give tribal colleges $8,000</a> for each Native student they enroll, it has not met this financial and political commitment. </p>\n\n<p>Tribal colleges annually receive <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-federal-funding#:%7E:text=Congress%20Is%20Underfunding%20Tribal%20Colleges%20by%20$250%20Million%20Per%20Year%20%E2%80%94%20ProPublica\">$250 million less</a> than what the federal government promised them, a 2024 ProPublica investigation found.</p>\n\n<p>Tribal college and universities’ futures were cast in doubt in the spring of 2025, when the Trump administration announced a proposal to cut the <a href=\"https://www.bie.edu\">Bureau of Indian Education’s</a> annual budget from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/us/tribal-colleges-federal-funding-trump.html\">$183 million to $22 million</a>. The Bureau of Indian Education is part of the Department of the Interior and oversees education for Native students.</p>\n\n<p>But the Department of Education went on to announce in September that it would make a one-time, <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/minority-serving-institutions/2025/09/15/ed-reallocates-msi-funding-hbcus-tribal\">$495 million investment</a> in historically Black colleges and universities and TCUs. </p>\n\n<p>TCU leaders say they are still trying to understand the <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2025/09/16/trump-admin-doubles-funding-tribal-colleges-arizona/\">significance of this funding announcement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/how-tribal-educators-are-navigating-budget-challenges/\">what it will result in</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I think it is important to recognize that TCUs make broad contributions to society, well beyond the impact they have on individual students. </p>\n\n<p>TCUs teach entrepreneurship and business development and serve as pilot sites in launching businesses, for example. </p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/FrontPageDocs/National%20Study%20Executive%20Summary_AIHEC%20TCU%20Economic%20Impact%20Study%2009082025.pdf\">every federal dollar invested</a> in tribal colleges, the schools return $1.60 in tax revenue through the increased tax payments of their alumni and their alumni’s employers, according to a September 2025 report by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a national organization that represents TCUs. </p>\n\n<p>TCU <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/FrontPageDocs/National%20Study%20Executive%20Summary_AIHEC%20TCU%20Economic%20Impact%20Study%2009082025.pdf\">alumni also generated</a> $3.8 billion in added income, or gross domestic product, to the national economy from October 2022 through September 2023.</p>\n\n<p>These schools offer a unique pathway for Native students to attend a higher education institution, while teaching them the skills they need to build a stable career.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261222/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I served as President of Cankdeska Cikana Community College (CCCC) one of the 34 tribal colleges located in North Dakota and that is affiliated with AIHEC.

The barrage of unilateral presidential actions has not yet let up. </p>\n\n<p>These have included Trump’s efforts to remove <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/08/least-148000-federal-employees-have-left-government-under-trump-good-government-group-reports/407171/\">thousands of government workers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/tracking-trumps-unprecedented-often-illegal-firings-of-political-appointees-and-watchdogs/\">fire several prominent officials</a>, such as members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the chair of the Commission on Civil Rights. He has also attempted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-order-voice-of-america.html\">shut down entire agencies</a>, such as the Department of Education and the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>\n\n<p>For some scholars, these actions appear rooted in the psychology of an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ego-hubris-and-narcissism-where-donald-trump-ranks-among-the-other-45-american-presidents-241879\">unrestrained politician with an overdeveloped ego</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s more than that.  </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/graham-dodds.html\">a political science scholar</a> who studies presidential power, I believe Trump’s recent actions mark the culmination of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unitary_executive_theory_%28uet%29\">unitary executive theory</a>, which is perhaps the most contentious and consequential constitutional theory of the past several decades.</p>\n\n<h2>A prescription for a potent presidency</h2>\n\n<p>In 2017, Trump complained that <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/11/06/trump-continues-to-degrade-the-presidency-and-theres-no-quick-fix-coming/\">the scope of his power as president</a> was limited: “You know, the saddest thing is that because I’m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I am not supposed to be involved with the FBI, I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.”</p>\n\n<p>The unitary executive theory suggests that such limits wrongly curtail the powers of the chief executive.  </p>\n\n<p>Formed by conservative legal theorists in the 1980s to <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=jcl\">help President Ronald Reagan roll back</a> liberal policies, the unitary executive theory promises to radically expand presidential power. </p>\n\n<p>There is no widely agreed upon definition of the theory. And even its <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/714860\">proponents disagree</a> about what it says and what it might justify. But in its most basic version, the unitary executive theory claims that whatever the federal government does that is executive in nature – from implementing and enforcing laws to managing most of what the federal government does – the president alone should personally control it.</p>\n\n<p>This means the president should have <a href=\"https://shfg.wildapricot.org/executive-branch\">total control over the entire executive branch</a>, with its dozens of major governmental institutions and millions of employees. Put simply, the theory says the president should be able to issue orders to subordinates and to <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300191394/the-unitary-executive/\">fire them</a> at will.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President Donal Trump appears seated in the oval office.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office next to a poster displaying the Trump Gold Card on Sept. 19, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Trump%20executive%20orders&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Alex Brandon</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The president could boss around the FBI or order the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.execfunctions.org/p/the-comey-indictment-and-its-aftermath\">attorney general to investigate his political opponents</a>, as Trump has done. The president could issue <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2005.00262.x\">signing statements</a> – a written pronouncement – that reinterpret or ignore parts of the laws, like George W. Bush did in 2006 to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/brett-kavanaugh-signing-statements.html\">circumvent a ban on torture</a>. The president could control <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/trump-order-power-independent-agencies-00204798\">independent agencies</a> such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The president might be able to force the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-trump-federal-reserve-lisa-cook-fired-10780042\">Federal Reserve</a> to change interest rates, as Trump has suggested. And the president might possess inherent power to <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1122&amp;context=jcl\">wage war as he sees fit</a> without a formal authorization from Congress, as officials argued during Bush’s presidency.</p>\n\n<h2>A constitutionally questionable doctrine</h2>\n\n<p>A theory is one thing. But if it gains the official endorsement of the Supreme Court, it can become governing orthodoxy. It appears to many observers and scholars that Trump’s actions have intentionally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-firings-officials-legal-test.html\">invited court cases</a> by which he hopes the judiciary will embrace the theory and thus permit him to do even more. And the current <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5478640/unitary-executive-theory-argues-to-restore-the-presidents-authority\">Supreme Court appears ready to grant that wish</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Until recently, the judiciary tended to indirectly address the claims that now appear more formally as the unitary executive theory. </p>\n\n<p>During the country’s first two centuries, courts touched on aspects of the theory in cases such as <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/37/524/\">Kendall v. U.S.</a> in 1838, which limited presidential control of the postmaster general, and <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/272/52/\">Myers v. U.S.</a> in 1926, which held that the president could remove a postmaster in Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>In 1935, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/602/\">Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</a>, the high court unanimously held that Congress could limit the president’s ability to fire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. And in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/\">Morrison v. Olson</a> the court in 1988 upheld the ability of Congress to limit the president’s ability to fire an independent counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those decisions aligned with some unitary executive claims, but others directly repudiated them.</p>\n\n<h2>Warming up to a unitary executive</h2>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=djclpp\">series of cases</a> over <a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-132/guidance-on-administrative-law-judges-after-lucia-v-sec-s-ct-july-2018/\">the past 15 years</a>, the Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psq.12773\">moved in an unambiguously unitarian, pro-presidential direction</a>. In these cases, the court has <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/Excerpts%20from%20Three%20Views%20of%20the%20Administrative%20State.pdf\">struck down statutory limits</a> on the president’s ability to remove federal officials, enabling much greater presidential control. </p>\n\n<p>These decisions clearly suggest that long-standing, anti-unitarian landmark decisions such as Humphrey’s are on increasingly thin ice. In fact, in Justice Clarence Thomas’ 2019 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf\">concurring opinion</a> in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/19-7\">Seila Law LLC v. CFPB</a>, where the court ruled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s leadership structure was unconstitutional, he articulated his desire to “repudiate” the “erroneous precedent” of Humphrey’s.</p>\n\n<p>Several cases from the court’s <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/stephen-vladeck/the-shadow-docket/9781541605183/?lens=basic-books\">emergency docket, or shadow docket</a>, in recent months indicate that other justices share that desire. Such cases do not require full arguments but can indicate where the court is headed.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-ignores-precedent-instead-of-overruling-it-in-allowing-president-to-fire-officials-whom-congress-tried-to-make-independent-257784\">Trump v. Wilcox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-trump-fire-members-product-safety-agency-rcna218882\">Trump v. Boyle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2025/09/25/supreme-court-allows-trump-to-fire-democrat-rebecca-slaughter-from-ftc-for-now/\">Trump v. Slaughter</a>, all from 2025, the court upheld Trump’s firing of officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. </p>\n\n<p>Previously, these officials had appeared to be protected from political interference.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694166/original/file-20251002-56-htcxkm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President George W.

Boyle, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a11_2cp3.pdf\">Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> wrote, “whether this Court will narrow or overrule a precedent … there is at least a fair prospect (not certainty, but at least a reasonable prospect) that we will do so.” And in her dissent in Trump v. Slaughter, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a264_o759.pdf\">Justice Elena Kagan</a> said the conservative majority was “raring” to overturn Humphrey’s and finally officially embrace the unitary executive.  </p>\n\n<p>In short, the writing is on the wall, and Humphrey’s may soon go the way of Roe v. Wade and other landmark decisions that had guided American life for decades.  </p>\n\n<p>As for what judicial endorsement of the unitary executive theory could mean in practice, Trump seems to hope it will mean total control and hence the ability to eradicate the so-called “<a href=\"https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/phantoms-beleaguered-republic-deep-state-and-unitary-executive\">deep state</a>.” Other conservatives hope it will diminish the government’s regulatory role.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf\">Kagan recently warned</a> it could mean the end of administrative governance – the ways that the federal government provides services, oversees businesses and enforces the law – as we know it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Humphrey’s undergirds a significant feature of American governance: bipartisan administrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with a measure of independence from presidential control. Congress created them … out of one basic vision. It thought that in certain spheres of government, a group of knowledgeable people from both parties – none of whom a President could remove without cause – would make decisions likely to advance the long-term public good.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the Supreme Court officially makes the chief executive a unitary executive, the advancement of the public good may depend on little more than the whims of the president, a state of affairs normally <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/law/specter-dictatorship\">more characteristic of dictatorship than democracy</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265840/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Graham G.

Many had helped <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-Rights-Mankind-History-American/dp/0945612281\">create state constitutions that included</a> pioneering bills of rights. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/oc/stc/entries/the-virginia-declaration-of-rights-june-12-1776\">Madison himself played a critical role</a> in securing passage in 1776 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a monument to civil liberties.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the Constitutional Convention met, however, Madison had soured on such measures. During the 1780s, he had watched with alarm as <a href=\"https://pjm.as.virginia.edu/sites/pjm.as.virginia.edu/files/inline-files/vices-political-system-linked-pages.pdf\">state legislatures trampled on rights</a> explicitly guaranteed by their constitutions. Bills of rights, he concluded, weren’t sufficient to protect rights.</p>\n\n<p>So Madison and his colleagues <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-framers-coup-9780199942039?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">put their faith in reinventing government</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>No appetite to haggle</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution\">The Constitution</a> they wrote created a government powerful enough to promote the national interests while maintaining a check on state legislatures. It also established a system of checks and balances that ensured federal power wasn’t abused.</p>\n\n<p>In the convention’s waning days, delegates briefly discussed adding a bill of rights but unanimously <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/farrand-the-records-of-the-federal-convention-of-1787-vol-2\">decided against it</a>. They had sweated through almost four months of a sweltering Philadelphia summer and were ready to go home. When Virginia’s John Rutledge noted “the extreme anxiety of many members of the Convention to <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/farrand-the-records-of-the-federal-convention-of-1787-vol-2\">bring the business to an end</a>,” he was stating the obvious. With the Constitution in final form, few had the appetite to haggle over the provisions of a bill of rights.  </p>\n\n<p>That decision <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">nearly proved fatal</a> when the Constitution went to the states for ratification. </p>\n\n<p>The new Constitution’s supporters, <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/federalists/\">known as Federalists</a>, faced fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists who charged that a powerful national government, unrestrained by a bill of rights, would inevitably lead to tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>Ratification conventions in <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">three of the most critical states</a> – Massachusetts, New York and Virginia – were narrowly divided; ratification hung in the balance. Federalists resisted demands to make ratification contingent on amendments suggested by state conventions. But they agreed to add a bill of rights – after the Constitution was ratified and took effect.</p>\n\n<p>That concession did the trick. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A poster featuring an image of Colonial men and boys in a blacksmith shop, with 'Our Bill of Rights IS EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS' written on it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A poster from 1959, published by the U.S. government, about the First Amendment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://reagan.blogs.archives.gov/2022/07/28/constitutional-amendments-series-amendment-i-the-freedom-of-speech/\">Stanley Dersh citizenship poster, U.S. Government Publishing Office via Reagan Library</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Harmless, possibly helpful</h2>\n\n<p>The three critical states <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">ratified without condition</a>, and by midsummer 1788, the Constitution had been approved. </p>\n\n<p>However, when the First Congress met in March 1789, the Federalist majority <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-framers-coup-9780199942039?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">didn’t prioritize</a> a bill of rights. They had won and were ready to move on.</p>\n\n<p>Madison, now a Federalist leader in the House of Representatives, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">insisted that his party keep its word</a>. He warned that failure to do so would undermine trust in the new government and give Anti-Federalists ammunition to demand a new convention to do what Congress had left undone.</p>\n\n<p>But Madison wasn’t just arguing for his party keeping its word. He had also changed his mind.  </p>\n\n<p>The ratification debates and Madison’s correspondence with Thomas Jefferson led him to think differently about a bill of rights. He now thought it harmless and possibly helpful. Its provisions, Madison conceded, might become “<a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/01-11-02-0218\">fundamental maxims of a free government</a>” and part of “the national sentiment.” Broad popular support for a bill of rights might provide a check on government officials and how they wielded power.</p>\n\n<p>Madison <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">pushed his colleagues</a> relentlessly. Wary of provisions that would weaken the national government, he developed a slate of amendments focused on individual rights. Ultimately, Congress <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">approved 12 amendments</a> – ensuring rights from freedom of speech to protection from cruel and unusual punishment – and sent them to the states for ratification. </p>\n\n<h2>First Amendment no cure-all</h2>\n\n<p>By the end of 1791, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">10 of them – including the First Amendment ≠ had been ratified</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As Madison anticipated, the First Amendment wasn’t a cure for a government bent on suppressing dissent. From the <a href=\"https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700617654/\">Sedition Act</a> in the 1790s to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ageofmccarthyism0000schr_a8c6/ageofmccarthyism0000schr_a8c6\">McCarthyism</a> in the 1950s and the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/harvard-like-all-americans-cant-be-punished-by-the-government-for-speaking-freely-and-a-federal-court-decision-upholds-decades-of-precedents-saying-so-264743\">Trump administration’s</a> assault on the First Amendment, government has used its awesome powers to pursue and punish critics. </p>\n\n<p>On occasion, <a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/in-landmark-ruling-federal-court-says-trump-administration-violated-first-amendment-by-deporting-foreign-citizens-for-pro-palestinian-advocacy\">courts have intervened to protect First Amendment rights</a>, a weapon Madison didn’t anticipate. But <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us211\">not always</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the ultimate protection for First Amendment rights is “national sentiment,” as Madison suggested. Norm-breaking presidents can disregard the law, and judges may cave. But public sentiment is a powerful force, as Jimmy Kimmel can attest.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266639/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Donald Nieman receives funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.

It means scraping snow and ice off your car in frigid mornings. And it means making a lifelong vow to the city’s NFL franchise, the Bills – for better or worse, till death do us part. </p>\n\n<p>When I grew up in New York’s second-largest city, my community was bound together by loyalty to a football team <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6086560/2025/01/25/buffalo-bills-underdog-story-afc-championship-chiefs/\">that always found new ways to break our hearts</a>. And yet at the start of each NFL season, we always found reasons to hope – we couldn’t help ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Coming from this football-crazed culture, I often wondered about the psychology of fandom. This eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D. in sport consumer behavior. As a doctoral student, I was most interested in one question: Is fandom good for us?</p>\n\n<p>I found a huge body of research on the psychological and social effects of fandom, and it certainly made being devoted to a team look good. Fandom <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2010-23158-001.html\">builds belonging</a>, helps adults <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.27.4.271\">make friends</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-018-0068-9\">boosts happiness</a> and even provides a buffer against <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/gdn0000019\">traumatic life events</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, fandom is great, right?</p>\n\n<p>As famed football commentator Lee Corso would say: “<a href=\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/not-so-fast-my-friend-a-lee-corso-special-to-debut-august-22-on-espn-in-advance-of-the-legendary-analysts-final-college-gameday-show/\">Not so fast, my friend</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>While fandom appears to be a boon for our mental health, <a href=\"https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsm/29/6/article-p705.xml\">strikingly little research</a> had been conducted on the relationship between fandom and physical health.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to conduct a series of studies – mainly of people in Western countries – on this topic. I found that being a sports fan can have some drawbacks for physical health, especially among the most committed fans.</p>\n\n<h2>Reach for the nachos</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-10-98\">Playing sports is healthy</a>. But watching them? Not so much.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgating culture revolves around alcohol. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00296-9\">Research shows</a> that college sports fans binge drink at significantly higher rates than nonfans, are more likely to do something they later regretted and are more likely to drive drunk. Meanwhile, watch parties encourage <a href=\"https://www.profootballnetwork.com/how-long-is-a-football-game-breaking-down-the-time-between-the-first-and-last-whistle/\">being stationary for hours</a> and mindlessly snacking. And, of course, fandom goes hand in hand with heavily processed foods like wings, nachos, pizza and hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p>One fan told me that when watching games, his relationship with food is “almost Pavlovian”; he craves “decadent” foods the same way he seeks out popcorn at the movies.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694640/original/file-20251006-56-ucqs5y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of leather chairs filled with men, many of whom have multiple beers on their side tables.

One Gen Z fan I recently interviewed griped, “You might find one salad with a plain piece of lettuce and a quarter of a tomato.”</p>\n\n<h2>Eating away the anxiety and pain</h2>\n\n<p>The relationship between fandom and physical health isn’t just about guzzling beer, sitting for hours on end or scarfing down hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613481232\">One study</a> analyzed sales from grocery stores. The researchers found that fans consume more calories – and less healthy food – on the day following a loss by their favorite team, a reaction the researchers tied to stress and disappointment. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I found something similar: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14413523.2023.2260940\">Fandom induces</a> what’s called “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2024.101133\">emotional eating</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Emotions like anger, sadness and disappointment <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.724220\">lead to stronger cravings</a>. And this relationship is tied to how your favorite team performs when it matters most. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/IJSMS-07-2024-0165\">we found</a> that games between rivals and closely contested games yield more pronounced effects. Emotional states generated by the game are also <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4569227\">significantly correlated</a> with increased beer sales in the stadium.</p>\n\n<h2>High-calorie cultures</h2>\n\n<p>In another paper, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.2021-0128\">my co-authors and I found</a> that fans often feel torn between their desire to make healthy choices and their commitment to being a “true fan.”</p>\n\n<p>Every fan base develops its own culture. These unwritten rules <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2017.09.002\">vary from team to team</a>, and they aren’t just about wearing <a href=\"https://media.gettyimages.com/id/81347320/photo/united-states-football-closeup-of-green-bay-packers-fans-during-game-vs-detroit-lions-green-bay.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=gi&amp;k=20&amp;c=a8Gl4Ft7pbIHaYqgZtSipkLVKOKoMF209FTHCaYHJto=\">a cheesehead hat</a> or waving <a href=\"https://www.steelers.com/history/terrible-towel/\">a Terrible Towel</a>. They also include expectations around drinking, eating and lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p>These health-related norms are shaped by a variety of factors, including the region’s culture, team history and even team sponsorships.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Cincinnati Bengals <a href=\"https://www.bengals.com/news/skyline-chili-bengals-partner-2023\">partner with Skyline Chili</a>, a regional chain that makes a meat sauce that’s often poured over hot dogs or spaghetti. One Bengals fan I interviewed observed that if you attend a Bengals game, sure, you could eat something else – but a “true fan” eats Skyline.</p>\n\n<p>I have two studies in progress that show <a href=\"https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/18457\">how hardcore fans</a> typically align their health behaviors with the health norms of their fan base. This becomes a way to signal their <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uk8AFpo3BnYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=An+integrative+theory+of+intergroup+conflict&amp;ots=qNI87XhAxf&amp;sig=KSdOjkvfUwYi939OGFZ0F2WUwo8#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20integrative%20theory%20of%20intergroup%20conflict&amp;f=false\">allegiance to the team</a>, improve their standing among fellow fans, and contribute to <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-98657-000\">what makes the fan base distinct</a> in the eyes of its members.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two shirtless fans, one wearing a cheesehead hat, another wearing a helmet with antlers.

As one fan explained: “People make a bunch of fried food or huge pots of gumbo or étouffée, and eat all day – from hours before the game until hours after.”</p>\n\n<h2>A new generation of health-conscious fans</h2>\n\n<p>The fan experience is shaped by the culture in which it is embedded. Teams actively help shape these cultures, and there’s a business argument to be had for teams to play a bigger role in changing some of these norms.</p>\n\n<p>Gen Z is <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/%7E/media/mckinsey/email/genz/2024/01/2024-01-23d.html\">strikingly health-conscious</a>. They’re also <a href=\"https://pro.morningconsult.com/articles/gen-z-poll-sports-fandom\">less engaged with traditional fandom</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If stadiums and tailgates continue to revolve around beer and nachos, why would a generation attuned to fitness influencers and “<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seeking-fitspiration-on-social-media-202401033004\">fitspiration</a>” buy in? To reach this market, I think the sports industry will need to <a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2023/oct/gen-z-reshaping-professional-sports-economics.html\">promote its professional sports teams in new ways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some teams are already doing so. The British soccer team Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/lfc-partnership\">has partnered</a> with the exercise equipment company Peloton. Another club, Manchester City, has <a href=\"https://www.mancity.com/news/club/manchester-city-asahi-training-kit-announcement-63824000\">teamed up</a> with a nonalcoholic beer brand as the official sponsor of its practice uniforms.</p>\n\n<p>And several European soccer clubs have even joined a “<a href=\"https://healthystadia.eu/\">Healthy Stadia</a>” movement, revamping in-stadium food options and encouraging fans to walk and bike to the stadium.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I don’t think the solution is replacing typical fan foods with smoothies and salads. Alienating core consumers is generally <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/002224299405800404\">not a sound business strategy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I think it’s reasonable, however, to suggest sports teams might add more healthy options and carefully evaluate the signals they send through sponsorships.</p>\n\n<p>As one fan I recently interviewed said: “The NFL has had half-assed efforts like Play 60” – a campaign encouraging kids to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day – “while also making a ton of money from beer, food and, back in the day, cigarette advertisements. How can sports leagues seriously expect people to be healthier if they promote unhealthy behaviors?”</p>\n\n<p>Today’s consumers <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353835/gen-z-shoppers-are-choosing-brands-that-reflect-their-values?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">want to support brands</a> that reflect their values. This is particularly true for Gen Zers, many of whom are savvy enough to see through hollow campaigns and quick to reject hypocrisy. In the long run, I think this type of dissonance – sandwiching a Play 60 commercial between <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250320/Researchers-warn-meal-delivery-apps-could-undermine-global-nutrition-effortse28094heree28099s-how.aspx?\">ads for Uber Eats</a> and Anheuser-Busch – will prove counterproductive.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three people dressed up in hot dog costumes – one green, one red and one yellow – race during a baseball game.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Relish, ketchup and mustard ‘race’ during a September 2025 baseball game between the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Mariners – an encapsulation of the dissonance between showcasing both physical activity and junk food at sporting events.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/relish-mustard-and-ketchup-compete-in-the-hot-dog-derby-news-photo/2235290568?adppopup=true\">Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I, as much as anyone else, understand what makes fandom special – and yes, I’ve eaten my share of wings during Bills games. But public health is a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-06-2025-new-data--noncommunicable-diseases-cause-1-8-million-avoidable-deaths-and-cost-us-514-billion-USD-every-year--reveals-new-who-europe-report\">pressing concern</a>, and though the sports industry is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.21.3.297\">well-positioned to address this issue</a>, fandom isn’t helping. Actually, my research suggests it’s having the opposite effect.</p>\n\n<p>Striking the balance I’m advocating will be tricky, but the sports industry is filled with bright problem-solvers. In the film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/\">Moneyball</a>,” Brad Pitt’s character, Billy Beane, famously says sports teams must “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugN5aD5p2NU\">adapt or die</a>.” He was referring to the need for baseball teams to integrate analytics into their decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Professional sports teams eventually got that message. Maybe they’ll get this one, too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265158/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Aaron Mansfield does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Instead of landing a job and moving to the big city after graduation, many are moving back into their childhood homes instead. About <a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Fdemo%2Ftables%2Ffamilies%2Ftime-series%2Fadults%2Fad1.xls&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK\">1.5 million more adults under 35</a> live with their parents today than a decade ago. That’s a 6.3% jump, more than double the rate of growth for the young adult population overall.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is affordability. Over the past decade, urban rents have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEHA\">climbed about 4% per year</a>, while wages for full-time workers have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881900Q\">increased by only 0.6% annually</a>. That means it’s harder than ever to live in a big city on the typical salary – especially if you’re a new graduate without much work experience.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is even more challenging for aspiring homeowners: The median house price in the U.S. has risen about <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI\">90% in just 10 years</a>, or more than 6% each year. And as prices rise – the median home sells for <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\">more than $400,000</a> now – so too do the ages of homebuyers. The median first-time U.S. homebuyer is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/many-first-time-homebuyers-are-pushing-40-millennials-wait-vain-better-rcna201786\">38 years old</a>, up from <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/interactive-maps-median-age-of-home-buyers-2003-2013\">31 about a decade ago</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is the rent so high?</h2>\n\n<p>Put simply, there isn’t enough housing. <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/rpshah1.php\">As an economist</a>, I know that when demand rises faster than supply, prices have to increase. And supply is severely limited in the places where people most want to live: big cities such as <a href=\"https://edc.nyc/housing-crisis-and-new-york-city\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/regional-housing-need-san-francisco-bay-area/\">San Francisco</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In most of these cities, planning and zoning laws prevent developers from building enough to meet demand. For example, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3792544\">rezoning a plot of land</a> from commercial to residential often requires mountains of paperwork. And in many cities, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/business/single-family-zoning-laws\">objections from neighbors</a> can stall a proposed development. These are just two of many obstacles local governments throw in homebuilders’ way. </p>\n\n<p>One city that has tried something different is Austin, Texas. After <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/22/austin-texas-rents-falling/\">deliberately relaxing its zoning laws</a> a few years ago, Austin has seen <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2025/03/25/austins-property-boom-brings-bolder-new-build-luxury-to-a-balanced-market/\">a boom in home construction</a>. Rents fell by 10% in one year and by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-27/austin-rents-tumble-22-from-peak-on-massive-home-building-spree?srnd=homepage-americas\">as much as 22%</a> in two years after that change. By making it easier to build, Austin has made it cheaper to live there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Austin has a far lower share of its young adults living with their parents than many other cities do. <a href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/living-at-home-study/\">Just 6% of working adults</a> in the Austin metro area live with their parents, one analysis found, versus nearly 14% in Greater San Antonio and 20% in Greater Los Angeles. </p>\n\n<h2>The pros and cons of living with the ’rents</h2>\n\n<p>One obvious advantage of living with parents is that they tend to charge below-market rents, or nothing at all. That makes it easier to save for a deposit on a house, helping young adults get on the property ladder sooner than they would otherwise. Indeed, homeownership rates among those 25 to 34 have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CXU980230LB0403M#:%7E:text=Table_content:%20header:%20%7C%202023:%20%7C%2033%20%7C,%7C%202023::%202019:%20%7C%2033:%2033%20%\">risen slightly since 2016</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also potential disadvantages, however, particularly when it comes to socializing. Living at home with parents can make it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/dating-while-living-with-parents/620699/\">much more challenging</a> to <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-challenges-of-dating-while-living-at-home-with-your-parents\">meet new people</a>. This, in turn, could partly help explain why <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/families-and-households/ms-2.pdf\">Americans are getting married</a> and <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/geriatric-pregnancy-increases-complication-rate\">having children later in life</a>. These delays might not seem important, but they can leave people feeling like they’re behind in life, which can affect their health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>I also wonder whether living with parents is indirectly making young adults unhappier at work. That’s because older adults often live <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2473\">far from the urban centers</a> where <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/\">young people are most likely to find jobs</a> directly related to their degrees. Job satisfaction rates are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/25/young-workers-express-lower-levels-of-job-satisfaction-than-older-ones-but-most-are-content-with-their-job/\">substantially lower among 18- to 29-year-olds</a> than among the rest of the working population.</p>\n\n<h2>A problem for the entire US</h2>\n\n<p>The housing shortage isn’t just an issue for young adults. A recent analysis I found insightful was headlined “<a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/\">The housing theory of everything</a>.” It argued that the issue helps explain at least part of the current malaise in the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when people can’t live and work where they want, they’re unable to use their talents fully. That contributes to the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006092\">relatively slow productivity growth</a> the U.S. has experienced in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if people can’t live in areas where they might meet and work with like-minded individuals, they have fewer opportunities to share ideas, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-59517-1.00006-4\">which can hinder innovation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And if the housing shortage is indeed encouraging young adults to delay having children, it could make it harder for the U.S. to fund Social Security and other government programs in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Making it easier to build new homes in places people want to live and work could go a long way to easing these problems. It’s possible high rents translate into high barriers to adulthood, too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264570/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I am acquaintances with the authors of the article &quot;The Housing Theory of Everything.&quot;</span></em></p>",

Democratic leaders countered that <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403\">the subsidies are not a new demand</a> but rather the continuation of a program that has <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">helped keep record numbers of Americans insured since the pandemic</a> – and therefore that the issue could not be delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a standoff that blends fiscal and policy disagreements – a hallmark of contemporary budget politics.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://law.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/wendy-netter-epstein.aspx\">experts</a> in <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/christopher-robertson/\">health law</a>, we see this issue as simple but consequential from a legal standpoint. Congress authorized the enhanced subsidies in 2021, originally to cushion the economic fallout from COVID-19 for families, and extended them through 2025 in the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Without new legislation, the subsidies revert to pre-2021 levels on Jan. 1, 2026 – which would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/insurers-preliminary-rate-filings-anticipate-biggest-increases-in-aca-marketplace-plan-premiums-since-2018/\">jump in the cost of health insurance</a> and would make <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced subsidies explained</h2>\n\n<p>Most Americans under age 65 get insurance through their employers, which the federal government <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-exclusion-employer-sponsored-health-insurance-work\">subsidizes by making it tax-free</a>. Medicare, the program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the program that mainly serves low-income Americans, are heavily supported by subsidies too. </p>\n\n<p>But as of 2025, about <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/over-24-million-consumers-selected-affordable-health-coverage-aca-marketplace-2025\">1 in 6 people</a> under age 65 do not have access to this coverage, including many small-business owners and tradespeople, as well as part-time workers and those in the gig economy. For them, unsubsidized health insurance can be prohibitively expensive. </p>\n\n<p>To address this affordability problem, the ACA provided for households earning between 100% and 400% of the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">federal poverty level</a> to receive subsidies for purchasing policies on the ACA marketplace, effectively lowering premiums. The original law limited subsidies only to those making under 400% of the federal poverty level, which is, for a family of four in 2025, around US$128,000 per year. A family making $129,000 a year, however, would have to pay full price. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Family in the kitchen, mom cooks dinner as daughter watches.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">If the current ACA subsidies expire, almost 5 million people are likely to lose their health insurance coverage.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mother-and-daughter-cooking-together-at-home-royalty-free-image/1390904687\">FG Trade/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan\">American Rescue Plan</a> temporarily made two major changes in 2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It removed the 400%-of-poverty eligibility ceiling, extending help to many middle-income families. </p></li>\n<li><p>It capped the maximum household contribution at 8.5% of income for everyone, ensuring affordability regardless of income. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these reforms expire in 2026, the Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48290\">must revert to the older, less generous formula</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What the subsidies accomplished</h2>\n\n<p>The enhanced subsidies drove <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2025-open-enrollment-period-report-national-snapshot-2\">ACA marketplace participation to historic highs</a> – more than 24 million people selected plans for 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020. The Department of Health and Human Services found <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cddf36b40446d0052bed0af2ff9d9012/race-ethnicity-marketplace-2024-oep-ib.pdf\">disproportionate enrollment gains among Black and Latino Americans</a>, helping to reduce racial disparities in coverage.</p>\n\n<p>For many low-income enrollees, mid-level plans – <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/silver-health-plan/\">called silver plans in the ACA marketplace</a> – effectively became free. Middle-income families who previously earned just above the cutoff gained meaningful relief, sometimes saving thousands of dollars a year.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens if subsidies expire?</h2>\n\n<p>Analysts broadly agree that returning to the pre-2021 rules would mean large <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/insurers-preliminary-rate-filings-anticipate-biggest-increases-in-aca-marketplace-plan-premiums-since-2018/\">cost increases</a> and <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/if-health-insurance-subsidies-end-people-could-see-higher-prices-coverage-loss/\">coverage losses</a>. On average, the premiums that Americans will pay for ACA marketplace plans would <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">more than double</a>. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket premiums for an individual would jump from about $888 in 2025 to $1,900 in 2026. </p>\n\n<p>With these increases, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/changes-health-care-spending-and-uncompensated-care-under-enhanced-tax-credit\">Urban Institute</a>,  a think tank, projects that 7.3 million fewer people would receive subsidized marketplace coverage and 4.8 million more would become uninsured.</p>\n\n<p>This is highly consequential, as research shows that insurance coverage <a href=\"https://nihcm.org/publications/does-having-health-insurance-coverage-reduce-mortality\">saves lives by ensuring access to care</a>. Knocking nearly 5 million people off insurance may cause as many as <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf\">500 additional deaths per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Losses would disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. Free premium plans would disappear. Those making below 250% of the federal poverty level could see their net premiums rise more than fourfold, while those between 250% and 400% would see their premiums double. What’s more, rural Americans, already under pressure from the state of the economy, <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">face higher risks</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CyyCi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CyyCi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The fiscal and policy trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p>On the flip side, making the enhanced credits permanent would <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61734\">add about US$350 billion to federal deficits between 2026 and 2035</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates. Proponents argue that the <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/the-price-of-obamacare-subsidies-loss-millions-uninsured-thousands-at-greater-risk/\">cost is justified by reduced medical debt</a>, fewer uninsured, greater household stability and ultimately saving lives. Short-term savings from cutting the subsidies would also lead to higher health care costs, longer-term. But critics worry it’s a <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/cbo-jct-asked-about-impacts-of-making-health-insurance-premium-tax-credit-permanent/\">broad and expensive way to support affordability</a>, benefiting some higher-income households that could otherwise afford coverage, even though it would cost more than 8.5% of their income. </p>\n\n<p>Another concern is how the subsidies affect price competition. Under the ACA, the government pays most of the difference between what a household is expected to contribute and the actual cost of a standard benchmark plan. That means if health insurance companies raise their premiums, those who receive subsidies don’t feel the effect of the premium increases, because the federal subsidy simply grows to cover it. That means companies have fewer reasons to compete on price.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and administrative constraints</h2>\n\n<p>Because the subsidies are written into the tax code, only Congress can extend them or make them permanent. The question of whether to renew them was already debated strenuously when Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">big tax and spending package</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. By omitting the subsidies, the bill effectively raised health care costs for millions of middle-income Americans. States that run their own marketplaces may add some aid, but few can match the scale of federal support. </p>\n\n<p>Administrative timing matters too. The IRS, health insurers and the online marketplace all need to know how the subsidy amounts will be calculated – in other words, which income limits and premium caps Congress wants to use. These figures determine how much financial help people get when they sign up for coverage. Late or temporary fixes can create confusion for both consumers and administrators.</p>\n\n<h2>Options before Congress</h2>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have several options, each with different trade-offs. </p>\n\n<p>A permanent extension would provide stability for consumers and insurers – but at the cost of higher long-term federal spending. A short-term renewal of one to four years could soften the immediate jump in premiums while giving Congress time to reassess the policy, but it would continue the cycle of temporary fixes.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2025/07/30/aca-subsidy-extension-changes\">targeted approach</a> might preserve the larger subsidies for lower-income households but gradually reduce assistance for higher earners so that they aren’t guaranteed a cap of 8.5% of their income for insurance. This would make the policy more fiscally restrained but less universal.</p>\n\n<p>Some legislators have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/offsetting-aca-enhanced-subsidy-extensions\">offsetting the cost of ACA subsidies</a> by pairing an extension with savings elsewhere in the health system. Those savings could come from trimming what the government pays insurers to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or by reducing Medicare payments to doctors.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these options reflects a different balance among affordability, fiscal responsibility and administrative simplicity. Together, they highlight how difficult it is to design a policy that meets all three goals at once.</p>\n\n<h2>A structural challenge</h2>\n\n<p>The problem isn’t just political – it’s built into how time-limited programs like the enhanced ACA subsidies are designed. The subsidies <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/conservatives-backed-the-ideas-behind-obamacare-so-how-did-they-come-to-hate-it-149698\">have always reflected partisan divides</a>, but their temporary nature makes those divides even sharper. Lawmakers limited them to a few years to keep costs down, but that choice now means Congress has to reopen the same debate every year.</p>\n\n<p>When deadlines for renewing programs collide with larger funding fights, important benefits can lapse, not because lawmakers chose to end them but because the fights over broader spending leave little room for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it’s up to Congress to decide not only whether these subsidies continue, but whether big social policies like this should be settled through last-minute budget showdowns. For now, getting the government running and keeping health insurance affordable are part of the same fight.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266851/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Wendy Netter Epstein is a member of the Illinois Health Benefits Exchange Advisory Committee. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher Robertson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This concept is called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27174/\">self-tolerance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists thought self-tolerance was primarily established in the parts of the body that make immune cells, such as the thymus for T cells and the bone marrow for B cells. There, newly created immune cells that attack “self” are eliminated during development through a process called <a href=\"https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/18-3-t-lymphocytes-and-cellular-immunity\">central tolerance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, some of these self-reactive immune cells escape this process of elimination and are released into the rest of the body. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7636184/\">Sakaguchi’s 1995 discovery</a> of a new class of immune cells, called regulatory T cells, or Tregs, revealed another layer of protection: peripheral tolerance. These cells act as security guards of the immune system, patrolling the body and suppressing rogue immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram showing Tregs interacting with effector T cells and dendritic cells through various signaling molecules\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Regulatory T cells suppress immune responses using a variety of molecular signals.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mechanisms_of_suppression_by_regulatory_T_cells.png\">Giwlz/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While Sakaguchi identified the cells, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/83784\">Brunkow and Ramsdell</a> in 2001 uncovered the molecular key that controls them. They found that mutations in a gene called FOXP3 caused a fatal autoimmune disorder in mice. They later showed that similar mutations in humans lead to immune dysregulation and a rare and severe autoimmune disease called <a href=\"https://primaryimmune.org/understanding-primary-immunodeficiency/types-of-pi/ipex-syndrome\">IPEX syndrome</a>, short for immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome. This disease results from missing or malfunctioning regulatory T cells.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Sakaguchi confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1079490\">FOXP3 is essential</a> for the development of regulatory T cells. FOXP3 codes for a type of protein called a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13290\">transcription factor</a>, meaning it helps turn on the genes necessary for regulatory T cells to develop and function. Without this protein, these cells either don’t form or fail to suppress harmful immune responses. </p>\n\n<h2>Harnessing the immune system for medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Regulatory T cells can be heroes or villains, depending on the context. When regulatory T cells don’t work, it can lead to disease. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-00994-x\">breakdown in immune tolerance</a> can result in autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks healthy tissues. Conversely, in cancer, regulatory T cells can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-019-0175-7\">too effective in suppressing immune responses</a> that might otherwise destroy tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how FOXP3 and regulatory T cells work launched a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cei/uxad009\">new era in immunotherapies</a> that harness the immune system to treat autoimmune diseases and cancer. For autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116440\">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2025.08.004\">Type 1 diabetes</a>, researchers are exploring ways to boost the function of Tregs. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2022.06.008\">For cancer</a>, the goal is to inhibit Tregs, allowing the immune system to target tumors more aggressively.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of immune activation scale in the shape of a rainbow wedge, with 'vulnerable to infection' at the smaller end, 'sweet spot' in the middle, and 'autoimmunity' at the larger end\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Too much or too little immune activation can lead to illness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inflammation_scale.svg\">Kevbonham/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond disease treatment, this research may also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1099\">improve organ transplantation</a>, where immune tolerance is crucial to prevent rejection.

His reporting, aired on multiple episodes of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@PabloTorreFindsOut\">Pablo Torre Finds Out</a>,” focused on star forward <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/player/202695/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Leonard, one of the NBA’s most sought-after free agents, signed a four-year, US$176 million contract renewal with the Clippers during the 2021-22 off-season – the maximum allowed under league rules at the time. But Torre reported that in early 2022, Leonard’s LLC, KL2 Aspire, signed a cash and equity deal amounting to roughly $50 million through a brand sponsorship <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/04/01/climate-tech-startup-with-celebrity-and-billionaire-backers-files-for-bankruptcy/\">with Aspiration</a>, a now-bankrupt financial technology startup that marketed itself as a climate-friendly bank.</p>\n\n<p>Torre highlighted how the sponsorship coincided with major investments in Aspiration by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and another team investor. The arrangement, Torre suggested, looked less like a conventional endorsement deal and more like a “no-show” side payment that could have helped the Clippers keep their star without technically violating the salary cap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/30/sport/basketball-nba-kawhi-leonard-denies-wrongdoing-clippers-intl\">Leonard has denied</a> that the partnership was improper, insisting he fulfilled his contractual obligations. <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-03/basketball-nba-kawhi-leonard-clippers-salary-cap-drama-explained/105838906\">The Clippers</a> <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/clippers-steve-ballmer-denies-claim-team-skirted-nba-salary-cap-rules-kawhi-leonard-endorsement-deal\">and Ballmer</a> have also rejected claims of wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Torre’s reporting nevertheless had an immediate impact. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46146871/report-clippers-skirted-nba-salary-cap-kawhi-leonard-payment\">Major outlets picked up the story</a>, Aspiration’s bankruptcy filings drew renewed scrutiny, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/nba-launches-investigation-into-alleged-kawhi-leonard-no-show-endorsement-deal-to-skirt-salary-cap\">the NBA announced it was investigating the matter</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i3TQEQr3Yk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In the wake of Pablo Torre’s revelations, many legacy media outlets highlighted his reporting.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>At the University of Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.jou.ufl.edu\">College of Journalism &amp; Communications</a>, part of my research involves unpacking the importance of decentralized networks of local outlets that cover stories from underrepresented areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p>I see Torre’s work as a clear example of the growing need for this kind of <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/social-media-influences-mainstream-media\">bottom-up</a>, citizen journalism – particularly given media industry trends.</p>\n\n<h2>An eroding fourth estate</h2>\n\n<p>Watchdog journalism is supposed to hold power to account.</p>\n\n<p>This is sometimes referred to as the “fourth estate.” A term that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/152263791101300102\">dates back to the 17th century</a>, it reflects the idea that an independent press is supposed to act as a fourth pillar of power, alongside <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/three-branches/three-branches-of-government\">the three traditional branches</a> of modern democracies – legislative, executive and judicial. </p>\n\n<p>Proudly independent from political or financial influence, fourth estate news media has <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/reviving-the-fourth-estate/A4A8E31ACE63C7E46520364465D2AE5C\">traditionally</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/14648849231176110\">demonstrated</a> a public service commitment to exposing corruption, encouraging debate, highlighting issues that are important and forcing leaders to address those issues. </p>\n\n<p>The need for watchdog journalism appears more urgent than ever. </p>\n\n<p>In the Western world, with <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/news/press-release-restrictions-to-freedom-of-expression-as-democracy-loses-ground/\">authoritarianism on the rise</a>, the fourth estate is experiencing widespread threats. Reporters Without Borders’ latest <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/rsf-world-press-freedom-index-2025-economic-fragility-leading-threat-press-freedom\">World Press Freedom Index</a> found that global press freedom reached an all-time low in 2025.

Fierce competition for clicks, eyeballs and ad revenue impacts the type of content and stories that commercial outlets tend to focus on. </p>\n\n<p>There appears to be less and less of a financial incentive to put in the time, resources and effort required for deep investigative reporting. It’s just not worth the return on that investment for commercial outfits.</p>\n\n<h2>A full-court press</h2>\n\n<p>In the U.S., the Trump administration and media consolidations have further weakened the press’s ability to serve as a check on those in power.  </p>\n\n<p>Over the past year, two major TV networks — ABC and CBS — reached settlements for separate lawsuits brought forward by President Donald Trump tied to editorial choices on their broadcast programming. Needless to say, both decisions create significant precedents <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/abc-and-cbs-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief/\">that could prove consequential</a> for journalistic integrity and independence.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/h-r-4-and-h-r-517-signed-into-law-s-1582/\">the GOP-led Congress</a> stripped over $1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, dealing a blow to public nonprofit outlets NPR, PBS and their local affiliates.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah <a href=\"https://karenattiah.substack.com/p/the-washington-post-fired-me-but\">lost her job</a> after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/business/media/washington-post-karen-attiah.html\">speaking out</a> against gun violence on social media in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.</p>\n\n<p>From a structural standpoint, the U.S. media ownership landscape has, for decades, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-slippery-slope-of-the-oligarchy-media-model-81931\">been plagued by consolidation</a>. Media channels have become merely one slice of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/even-as-jimmy-kimmel-returns-to-the-airwaves-tv-networks-remain-more-vulnerable-to-political-pressure-than-ever-before-265653\">massive asset portfolios</a> of the conglomerates that control them.</p>\n\n<p>It’s probably fair to say that producing costly and burdensome watchdog journalism isn’t exactly a priority for busy executives at the top of these holding companies.</p>\n\n<h2>What about local media?</h2>\n\n<p>Independent local outlets are a dying breed, too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cislm.org/research/u-s-news-deserts/\">Studies have shown</a> that <a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/news-deserts-and-ghost-newspapers-will-local-news-survive/\">news deserts</a> – areas with little or no local coverage – are multiplying across the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>This has dire consequences for democratic governance: News deserts <a href=\"https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2023/\">often correlate</a> with lower civic engagement, reduced voter turnout and less accountability for business and political leaders.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, fewer local journalists means less scrutiny of <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/how-the-decline-of-local-news-threatens-local-democracy\">local governments</a>, which undermines transparency and <a href=\"https://niemanreports.org/less-local-news-means-less-democracy/\">enables corruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, more readers seem to be getting their news from social media and podcasts. In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/25/1-in-5-americans-now-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-up-sharply-from-2020/\">a new Pew Research Center report</a>, 1 in 5 Americans get their news from TikTok alone.

You feel the wind blowing and see clouds move across the sky. Sometimes there are storms where the wind gets really strong, it might rain, or there might be thunder and lightning.</p>\n\n<p>Did you know that there’s weather in space too? It all starts with the Sun.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sun: The bright star in our solar system</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/en/\">The Sun</a> is a very hot, very big ball of gas at the center of our solar system. <a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/surface.shtml\">Its surface</a> can reach a blistering 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). That’s nearly five times hotter than lava that spews from volcanoes on Earth, and just like lava, the Sun glows from the heat.</p>\n\n<p>The Sun <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/big-ideas/big-idea-3-1/\">is made up of</a> what <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/yeimy-rivera\">solar physicists</a> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/tatiananiembro/\">like us</a> <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/sam-badman\">call</a> plasma. </p>\n\n<p>Normal gases, like the air you breathe on Earth, are made up of atoms bouncing around. <a href=\"https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation/atomic-structure\">Atoms consist of</a> a positively charged bundle of particles called the nucleus and negatively charged particles called electrons. The nucleus and the electrons are tightly stuck together so that atoms are overall neutral – that is, they have no charge. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engage.aps.org/dpp/resources/what-is-plasma\">A gas becomes a plasma</a> when the atoms it’s made of become so hot that their negatively charged electrons split apart from their positively charged nuclei. Now that the charged particles are separated from each other, the plasma can conduct electricity, and magnetic fields may pull the plasma or push it away.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8cSQltH6TU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Plasma is made up of charged particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Solar wind blows out of the Sun all the time</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the Moon lines up with Sun, blocking it from view and turning the sky dark. This phenomenon is called a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/\">total solar eclipse</a>. During an eclipse, you can see faint, wispy structures surrounding the Moon that extend across the sky. In that moment, what you are seeing is the Sun’s atmosphere: <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-corona/en/\">the corona</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The corona can reach millions of degrees, which is much hotter than the Sun’s surface. In fact, the corona is so hot that the particles shoot out of the Sun, escaping from the Sun’s gravity, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/\">engulfing the entire solar system</a>. This stream of plasma is called the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/what-is-the-solar-wind/\">solar wind</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The solar wind’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/2-solar-probes-are-helping-researchers-understand-what-phenomenon-powers-the-solar-wind-235286\">invisible, continuous gust of plasma</a> fills a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/heliosphere/\">bubble in space</a> that extends far beyond the orbit of Pluto. It can reach up to 2 million miles per hour (3 million kilometers per hour) – at that speed, the solar wind would take less than a minute to circle the Earth. For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station takes 90 minutes</a> to go around the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s hard to see the solar wind directly in photos once it leaves the corona, we can measure the gas directly with instruments in space. Scientists have recently gotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c80TzqNoqMg\">up close and personal</a> with it by sending missions such as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/\">Parker Solar Probe</a> closer to the Sun than ever before. The Parker Solar Probe flies directly into the solar wind and measures the gas directly just as it escapes the Sun – like a weather station. </p>\n\n<p>The Parker Solar Probe also has a <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/250716-parker-closest-sun-images\">specialized camera</a> that points sideways to see the Sun’s light as it scatters off the solar wind. Light scattering is the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-sky-blue-246393\">same process</a> that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUIlhKhzDA\">makes the sky blue</a> on Earth.    </p>\n\n<h2>Big solar explosions</h2>\n\n<p>The solar wind <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a014800/a014892/14892_009_PSP_EarthSunHelioPause_1080.mp4\">surrounds and engulfs the Earth</a> and other planets all the time, but most of the time it is safely guided around us by our planet’s magnetic field. However, occasionally the Sun also generates huge explosions that release big clouds of plasma into our solar system, some of which are directed toward Earth. These massive events are called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3NAdOYp8Q\">coronal mass ejections</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kSx7AOwEco?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA spacecraft track solar storms from their eruptions on the Sun until their impact on Earth.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Compared to the solar wind, which is always blowing, coronal mass ejections are short-lived but extreme. You can think of them as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/solar-storm-knocks-out-farmers-high-tech-tractors-an-electrical-engineer-explains-how-a-larger-storm-could-take-down-the-power-grid-and-the-internet-177982\">solar storms</a>. Solar storms also involve one important force that doesn’t really play a role in the weather on Earth: magnetism. </p>\n\n<p>The Sun is like a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">giant magnet</a>. All magnets create what we call magnetic field lines, which are lines along which charged particles such as plasma have an easy time traveling. The Sun’s magnetic field lines can be very twisted, and the solar wind and coronal mass ejections deform and drag them outward from the Sun. </p>\n\n<p>When these solar storms reach Earth, their coiled magnetic fields can sometimes interact with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/earths-magnetic-field-protects-life-on-earth-from-radiation-but-it-can-move-and-the-magnetic-poles-can-even-flip-216231\">our planet’s own magnetic field</a> and cause disturbances called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-nqOJU55s\">space weather</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Space weather is caused by the Sun</h2>\n\n<p>The Earth has a magnetic field and a protective bubble: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4FSg-90XlA&amp;t=3s\">the magnetosphere</a>. The magnetosphere shields us from the Sun’s solar wind and solar storms, acting like a force field to keep living things safe from the energetic particles released by the Sun. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TnFXddv37E?wmode=transparent&amp;start=19\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Magnetic reconnection happens when the magnetic field from a coronal mass ejection interacts with Earth’s magnetic field.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Most of the time this protective bubble works so well that you can’t tell that there is anything special happening out in space. During particularly big storms, however, some solar wind plasma can make it down into the Earth’s atmosphere. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLq6plMjU0\">coronal mass ejections pass</a> over Earth, their magnetic field <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TnFXddv37E&amp;t=19s\">can interact with Earth’s magnetic field</a>. The Sun and Earth’s magnetic field lines untangle and rearrange, and for a short while these fields can link together and let the Sun’s plasma in.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens, it can cause big <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJfy8acFaOg&amp;t=120s\">magnetic storms</a> all over the world. This interaction between ejections from the Sun and the Earth is what scientists refer to as space weather. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Green lines of light crossing the night sky, above a snow-covered landscape.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Space weather causes beautiful light shows near the North and South Poles on Earth.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=aurora%20borealis&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Rene Rossignaud, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Space weather is just like the weather on Earth, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colliding-plasma-ejections-from-the-sun-generate-huge-geomagnetic-storms-studying-them-will-help-scientists-monitor-future-space-weather-248384\">generated by its atmosphere</a>.

It reemerged in August 2025 when two pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/mn-pharmacists-say-were-punished-after-refusing-dispense-gender-transition-drugs\">sued Walgreens and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy</a>, saying they had been punished after refusing to dispense gender-affirming care medications that go against their religious beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>According to the pharmacists, Walgreens refused their requests for a formal religious accommodation, citing state law. One pharmacist had her hours reduced; the other was let go. If Minnesota law does not allow such an accommodation, <a href=\"https://www.umlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pharmacy-Filed-Complaint.pdf\">their lawsuit argues</a>, it violates religious freedom rights.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eEr0Q90AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a sociologist of law and medicine</a>, I’ve spent the past 20 years studying how pharmacists grapple with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/book.126995\">tensions between their personal beliefs</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.11.041\">and employers’ demands</a>. Framing the problem as a tension between religious freedom and patients’ rights is only one approach. Debates about pharmacists’ discretion over what they dispense also raise bigger questions about professional rights – and responsibilities. </p>\n\n<h2>Duty to dispense?</h2>\n\n<p>The most famous controversy, perhaps, dealt with contraception. In the early 2000s, some pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2005/12/03/5038222/pharmacists-suspended-over-prescription-oath\">refused to dispense Plan B</a>, also known as “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emergency-contraception-is-often-confused-with-abortion-pills-heres-how-plan-b-and-other-generic-versions-work-to-prevent-pregnancy-191310\">emergency contraception</a>” or the “morning-after pill.” Their refusal stemmed from a belief that it caused an abortion. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/health/morning-after-pills-abortion-fda.html\">That is inaccurate</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/plan-b-one-step-15-mg-levonorgestrel-information\">medical authorities</a>. When Plan B first became available in 1999, the label said the medication might work by expelling an egg that had already been fertilized. In 2022, the Food and Drug Administration relabeled Plan B to say that it acts before fertilization. From a medical perspective, both mechanisms are contraception, not abortion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pair of tweezers holds a white pill, photographed in front of a box that says 'PlanB One Step.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Plan B’s early labeling contributed to confusion over how it works.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-photo-illustration-a-planb-one-step-contraceptive-news-photo/1406069799?adppopup=true\">Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>States responded to pharmacists’ refusals by adopting “<a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/pharmacy-refusals-101/\">responsibility laws</a>.” Some states <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17813/maiq.18.4.d0645433x5272652\">adopted “conscience clauses</a>” that <a href=\"https://www.kait8.com/story/5410417/conscience-clause-protects-arkansas-pharmacists-who-wont-dispense-plan-b/\">permitted pharmacists not to fill the prescription</a>. Others opted for “<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-45/section-45-14-67-1/\">duty to dispense</a>” laws that required pharmacists or pharmacies to provide the medication, or “<a href=\"https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PharmacyRefusalPolicies-June2010.pdf\">refuse and refer</a>” laws obligating objecting pharmacists to hand the prescription off to a colleague.</p>\n\n<p>This fight largely broke down across political lines. Groups that oppose abortion rights <a href=\"https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(05)02103-7/fulltext\">argued that pharmacists should have the right to opt out</a>, while groups in favor of abortion rights argued that <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/pharmacy-refusals-101/\">pharmacists should be required to dispense</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As this fight escalated, the conflict became about more than contraception or abortion. It revealed Americans’ views about what kinds of professionals pharmacists should be, and whether they are professionals at all – that is, members of <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo5965590.html\">occupational groups that have specialized knowledge and skills</a>, and exclusive rights to do particular kinds of work.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, for example, the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice American – now called Reproductive Freedom for All – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888411400700\">released an ad</a> with a man and a woman in bed, their feet hanging out of the sheets. Stuck between them was someone else wearing heavy black shoes. “Who invited the pharmacist?” the ad asked. </p>\n\n<p>Pro-choice organizations insisted that pharmacists had no right to question a doctor’s prescription. “A pharmacist’s job is to dispense medication, <a href=\"https://mobilization.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/maiq/18/4/article-p429.xml\">not moral judgment</a>,” said the president of Planned Parenthood Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>Some pharmacists felt that such messages did not just criticize “moral gatekeeping” but also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888411400700\">undermined their claims to professional authority</a>. Pharmacists undergo six years of training to earn a doctorate and are health care’s medication specialists. The idea that pharmacists were simply technicians, hired to fill whatever a prescription said, made them seem like physicians’ underlings.</p>\n\n<h2>Keeping patients safe</h2>\n\n<p>A short time later, when the opioid overdose crisis <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html\">began to escalate</a>, pharmacists again found themselves pulled in two directions. This time, the question was whether they should be <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691224770/policing-patients?srsltid=AfmBOorna0XO3X_o0LtTBYZ74TSkVxDtBT1iIX3yAot2vPCcn2J1RpoV\">both medical and legal gatekeepers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When the U.S. first tried to crack down on unauthorized opioid use, many pharmacists felt ambivalent about tasks like identifying people who were misusing or selling medications. One pharmacist told me, “Although I’m in the business of patient safety, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/lsi.12092\">I’m not in the police business</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Later, pharmacists began to see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231209445\">policing tasks as health care tasks</a>. They reasoned that policing patients helped keep patients safe, and they embraced enforcement as a key component of their work.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to 2021. America was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6935a4\">some doctors were prescribing</a> <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-hydroxychloroquine-and-chloroquine-dont-block-coronavirus-infection-of-human-lung-cells-143234\">hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin</a> to treat sick patients, though the FDA had not approved the medications for that purpose. Many pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Blogs/CEO-Blog/court-addressed-how-and-why-a-pharmacist-may-legally-decline-to-honor-a-prescription\">refused to fill those prescriptions</a>, citing lack of scientific evidence and potential harm.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A box with an image of a horse's silhouette, running in front of an orange-and-yellow sunset.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, some physicians wrote off-label prescriptions for ivermectin – a drug used to kill worms and other parasites, intended for use in horses.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IvermectinWisconsinLawsuit/449ece27701548549eb3d57aef93cf3f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Ted S.

Liberals tended to oppose the bills, portraying pharmacists as skilled professionals whose expertise is essential to prevent harm. Conservative supporters claimed that pharmacists <a href=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/10/16/court-order-sought-requiring-pharmacies-to-fill-controversial-covid-19-prescriptions/\">should dispense whatever the doctor writes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional power</h2>\n\n<p>Each of these controversies has focused on a specific legal, ethical or medical issue. By extension, though, they are also about what kinds of professional discretion pharmacists should be able to exercise. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to medication, doctors prescribe, nurses administer and pharmacists dispense. Before the 20th century, pharmacists diagnosed disease and also compounded drugs. That changed when physicians <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/paul-starr/the-social-transformation-of-american-medicine/9780465093038/?lens=basic-books\">placed themselves at the top of the medical hierarchy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to professional autonomy, states regulate health care, but they permit health care professions to regulate themselves: to educate, license and discipline their own workers through professional boards. In exchange, <a href=\"https://nabp.pharmacy/about/boards-of-pharmacy/\">these boards</a> must do so “<a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/in-the-public-interest/9780813554266/\">in the public interest</a>” – prioritizing public health, safety and welfare over professionals’ own interests. </p>\n\n<p>Health care professionals, including pharmacists, must also follow ethical codes. The day they receive their iconic white coats, <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/About/Oath-of-a-Pharmacist\">pharmacists vow</a> to “consider the welfare of humanity and relief of suffering [their] primary concerns.” Pharmacists also commit to “respecting the <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Code-of-Ethics\">autonomy and dignity of each patient</a>,” which means that pharmacists partner with patients to make choices about their health. </p>\n\n<p>Self-regulation has legally given pharmacists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.11.041\">the right to act as “medical gatekeepers</a>” – to use their professional expertise to keep patients safe. <a href=\"https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/pharmacists-role-medication-safety\">This role is critical</a>, as patients whose lives have been saved by pharmacists catching errors can attest.</p>\n\n<p>It has not, however, given them the right to be “moral gatekeepers” who put their personal beliefs above the patient’s. Pharmacists control medications because of professional commitments, not personal beliefs. The <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Code-of-Ethics\">code of ethics</a> describes the pharmacist-patient relationship as a “covenant” that creates moral obligations for the pharmacist – including helping “individuals achieve optimum benefit from their medications,” being “committed to their welfare” and maintaining their trust. </p>\n\n<p>If pharmacists wish to regulate themselves, history makes clear they need to define what it means to act in the public interest and ensure that other pharmacists comply. If not, the state has proved more than willing to step in and do the job for them. They may not like the results.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264844/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Elizabeth Chiarello has received funding from the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

Those numbers are likely to be an underestimate, as there are no official surveys that track this information. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t have strong data on the high school graduation rates of college students who are not living in the U.S. legally. The best estimates suggest that about <a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NICOD2016_TOOLKIT-copy.pdf\">5% to 10% of all undocumented high schoolers go off to college</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Research shows that legal battles over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, have contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/news/enrollment-undocumented-students-california-universities-dropped-2016-2023\">drop in college enrollment</a>. DACA is a federal immigration policy that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/daca-trump-immigration-texas-doj-5b9990853b3f391e9cbca24706d4edb6\">allows some immigrants</a> who came to the U.S. as young children to receive temporary protection from deportation and to get work permits. </p>\n\n<p>College graduation rates are shaped by a number of factors, including the state an immigrant student lives in and whether they can receive in-state tuition and state-based financial aid. Other important factors are whether there are undocumented student resource centers and supportive mentors on campus. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How is attending college different for students without legal authorization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Undocumented high school students thinking about college may be unaware of their legal and financial options. Undocumented students frequently receive incorrect information about college options – and sometimes they do not want to disclose their <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/content/qt031649nf/qt031649nf.pdf\">immigration status to a school counselor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Where an undocumented student lives determines whether they can afford to pay for college, or in some cases whether they can attend at all. Undocumented students cannot receive any <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/help/fafsa\">federal student aid</a>, regardless of where they live, because you need to be an American citizen to receive this aid. Financial help is critical for many students, including immigrants, as most students receive some financial aid to <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/7_26_2023.asp\">pay for college</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are 22 states, as well as Washington, that allow undocumented students to <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">pay in-state tuition</a>. In addition, undocumented high schoolers are eligible for state-based financial aid in <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">14 states</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, 10 states, like Wisconsin and Oklahoma, have enacted laws <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/#:%7E:text=State%20Policy%20Hub-,Portal%20to%20the%20States,all%20or%20some%20public%20colleges\">to block</a> undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can these students receive merit-based scholarships?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>That depends. Some scholarship programs require a lawful immigration status. Some scholarships might require students to be eligible for <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell\">Pell Grants</a>, meaning they also need lawful immigration status. Other programs, like public colleges in California and Washington state, have merit-based scholarships that undocumented students can apply for. Several national private scholarships are also available for undocumented students. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there some cases where these students simply cannot legally attend college?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are three states – <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/undocumented-daca-students/\">Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina</a> – where undocumented students cannot apply to most public universities. For these states, the board of regents <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/state/georgia/\">prohibits admission </a> for undocumented students. </p>\n\n<p>In Washington state, undocumented students who are residents can apply for state-based financial aid. Other states, like California, provide similar forms of aid. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are other practical questions prospective students need to consider?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, there’s the cost of going to college. Undocumented students are much more likely than citizens to be <a href=\"https://immigrationinitiative.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UNDERSTANDING-AND-SUPPORTING-UNDOCUMENTED-MIXED-STATUS-STUDENTS-IN-SCHOOLS_FINAL.pdf\">living in poverty</a>. And in general, <a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing/highlights\">college tuition is rising</a>. If you do not have access to resources, such as in-state tuition and state-based financial aid, the cost will likely be a prohibitive factor.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the question of what comes after college. Generally, without a lawful immigration status, undocumented students <a href=\"https://www.smc.edu/student-support/career-services/employment/documents/LifeAfterCollegeGuide.pdf\">struggle to find work</a>. Some states, like California and Washington, have enacted policies to remove barriers for <a href=\"https://www.kuow.org/stories/undocumented-washingtonians-can-now-work-as-doctors-and-teachers-under-new-law\">professional licenses</a>, letting undocumented immigrants still pursue different career paths. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How is Trump changing the education landscape for immigrant families?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/the-anti-immigrant-policies-in-trumps-final-big-beautiful-bill-explained/\">aggressive enforcement</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/us/trump-chicago-immigration-national-guard.html\">immigration policy</a> is prompting more undocumented students to consider whether they need to stay close to home, as many fear that they or their family members will be deported. </p>\n\n<p>Many undocumented students face <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12840\">significant family obligations</a> at home, as I find in my research. This can dissuade them from going far from home, or even from going to school at all.</p>\n\n<p>I know students who are now contemplating taking a year of absence, or dropping out altogether. I also know students who cannot concentrate on school work, because they are anxious about whether their loved ones will be detained. Many also have younger siblings and feel the pressure of stepping into a guardian role. </p>\n\n<p>Texas is an example of a place where undocumented students are particularly under stress. It was one of the first states to provide in-state tuition for undocumented students. In June 2025, the state <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/fight-over-in-state-tuition-undocumented-students/\">rescinded the policy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, undocumented college students in Texas need to pay out-of-state tuition costs, even if they have paid in-state so far. That roughly doubles the cost of annual tuition. Students and staff on the ground are scrambling to figure how to make sense of this abrupt policy shift. Similar rollbacks have happened <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/02/20/florida-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">in Florida</a> and other states, and all of these measures are making it more challenging for undocumented students to consider pursing higher education.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266324/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Vanessa Delgado does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Indeed in 2024, 111 countries <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-myanmar-to-gaza-ukraine-to-sudan-2024-was-another-grim-year-according-to-our-mass-atrocity-index-246294\">experienced some form of mass atrocity</a> against civilians. </p>\n\n<p>While it is crucial to support these communities now through humanitarian aid and pressure on parties to end the violence, it is also important to continue the work once the fighting has ended by documenting the atrocities and elevating the voices of victims and survivors.

Don’t let marginalized voices be an afterthought</strong></p>\n\n<p>From my experience, post-atrocity fieldwork can too often rely on collections of firsthand accounts that include only, or for the most part, men. Women’s stories of intervening in mass violence tend to be largely absent. </p>\n\n<p>This reflects how post-atrocity research often overlooks the impact of gender norms and hierarchies. Depending on local cultures, women are often portrayed as victims by researchers, but men are frequently the voices of everyone’s experiences. </p>\n\n<p>Women have traditionally been excluded in post-atrocity research simply because no one asked them. Their experiences were dismissed as indistinct from men’s, shaped by patriarchal assumptions about heroism. There may also be reasons around the culture or stigma of surviving violence that silence women’s voices.</p>\n\n<p>Yet my interviews revealed women played vital roles — saving lives, resisting violence and halting militias. Ironically, it was often their political invisibility that enabled women’s acts of intervention.</p>\n\n<p>As such, a best practice approach to post-atrocity fieldwork would involve researchers actively including marginalized voices from the outset — particularly women, racial and ethnic minorities, and members of groups historically excluded — and use methods that uncover how power, identity and visibility shape who gets remembered.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://scholars.csus.edu/esploro/profile/nicole_fox/overview\">Nicole Fox</a>, associate professor of criminal justice, California State University, Sacramento</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Positionality is a method, not just a mindset</strong></p>\n\n<p>Navigating <a href=\"https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/\">positionality</a> – that is, a given individual’s place in society based on factors such as gender, class and race – in post-genocide research is both challenging and essential. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not just about self-reflection; it’s about shaping how and why you ask questions in places where trust has been shattered. </p>\n\n<p>Too often, researchers swoop in, collect stories and leave. But that does not truly capture the lived realities of people who have survived mass violence.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid this, it is important to build teams that include both insiders and outsiders. For example, we put together a team to conduct fieldwork that included a Rwandan genocide survivor, a South African scholar and an American scholar. We came from different regions, disciplines and life experiences. Crucially, our Rwandan colleague was a full research partner as well as acting as a translator. His presence granted access and trust we could never have earned alone.</p>\n\n<p>For researchers in sensitive contexts, building collaborative and thoughtful teams isn’t just ethical – it’s methodologically essential.</p>\n\n<p>This commitment to critical reflection and research design also plays out in how researchers from the Global South navigate predominantly Western academic spaces. </p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-wolfe-491b7786/\">Stephanie Wolfe</a>, professor of political science at Weber State University</em></p>\n\n<p>As an African researcher among mostly Western scholars, I found that I was perceived as African first and researcher second – which was a double-edged sword.</p>\n\n<p>It involved having to endure inquiries from colleagues that were often much more personal than professional, and having to prove sufficiently “Africanness” to white researchers.</p>\n\n<p>Such experiences made it hard to be taken seriously. As one of the few African-born scholars in the post-atrocity research space working in the U.S., it was important not to be an outsider. Positionality isn’t a footnote – it’s your lens and lived experience.</p>\n\n<p>As a field researcher, it is crucial to create spaces for more diverse scholars to be able to conduct research without being continually devalued or tested.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/kuraduse.cfm\">Claudine Kuradusenge-McLeod</a>, lecturer in  peace, human rights &amp; cultural relations at American University</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Secondary trauma is real and needs our attention</strong></p>\n\n<p>If trauma results from direct experience, secondary trauma occurs where people are exposed to or interact with those who have experienced trauma firsthand.</p>\n\n<p>Experiencing secondary trauma is an often-underappreciated dynamic of doing field research. Conducting interviews with survivors of violence can leave the researcher with images, sounds and vicarious connections to trauma. </p>\n\n<p>Post-atrocity researchers then have a real need to receive appropriate training, support and therapy. Breaking down the silent-burden element of this kind of work and creating spaces to talk and share this element of working with trauma in post-atrocity situations would better prepare researchers for the field.</p>\n\n<p>Creating lifelines, such as support networks, in the field and out, is essential to having the right support when it’s needed most. It is important that researchers also recognize that secondary trauma ties the practitioner to the field and our interviewees; this can be a resource for understanding violence and how it can be prevented. </p>\n\n<p>Universities can help researchers by providing resources to deal with secondary trauma. In addition, researchers themselves can find ways to talk about, share and process this kind of trauma.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/people/profile.html?id=cdavey\">Chris Davey</a>, lecturer in political science, Binghamton University</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Building trust is a process, not just an outcome</strong></p>\n\n<p>Attempting to create trust while conducting research in a post-genocidal society is challenging, yet vital. Knowing and respecting cultural, linguistic and historical norms are important ways for researchers to follow the principle of “do no harm.” </p>\n\n<p>In post-atrocity contexts, researchers have to contend with navigating complex sociopolitical dynamics to determine who they can trust, what organizations should be partnered with, and what is safe to do, ask or even publish. </p>\n\n<p>In some cases, researchers may also choose what not to do – such as stopping or declining an interview if it might put someone at risk. Practitioners are responsible for minimizing risk when working in communities that have experienced a complete breakdown of trusting relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing this dynamic can prepare researchers to preempt potential issues and manage unintended harm in a community that is already struggling to rebuild social trust.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, trust-building shouldn’t be seen as a means to an end, but as part of a process through which practitioners do no harm in the field and mitigate risk for partners who live in the research setting.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.umb.edu/directory/samanthalakin/\">Samantha Lakin</a>, Senior Fellow, Center for Peace, Democracy, &amp; Development, UMass Boston</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Navigating bureaucracy and authoritarian spaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing how to safely navigate bureaucracy is crucial for keeping researchers and field-based teams safe in post-atrocity settings.</p>\n\n<p>Whether this means carrying documentation around, taking additional time to meet with authorities to get their approval for research, or being able to provide forms of compensation to officials, researchers need to be prepared. </p>\n\n<p>Taking this time might mean delaying engaging directly with survivors or other research participants, but it can often lead to insights about the local context, safety and the intersectionality of officials who might have unique takes on research themes.</p>\n\n<p>Working with local partners, like <a href=\"https://gecshceruki.org/en/\">GEC-SH</a> in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, to identify expectations in the field and learn from this existing expertise is key to successfully navigating bureaucracy – as is allocating additional time to cooperate with authorities and to understand the local context – including practices that might be characterized as “bribes.”</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/people/profile.html?id=cdavey\">Chris Davey</a>, lecturer in political science, Binghamton University</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258245/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher P.

And then came <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">President Donald Trump’s peace plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 3, 2025, Hamas said that it <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hamas-agreed-to-parts-of-gaza-peace-proposal-trump-israel/\">accepted some aspects of the 20-point proposal</a>, including handing over administration of the Gaza Strip to a body of independent Palestinian technocrats and releasing all remaining Israeli hostages.</p>\n\n<p>Those hostages are the last of the 252 taken during <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/17/october-7-crimes-against-humanity-war-crimes-hamas-led-groups\">the Oct. 7, 2023, attack</a> – an event that two years on looks to represent a high point, so to speak, of Hamas’ power. As an <a href=\"https://mena.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/visiting-affiliated-faculty/mkhaimar-abusada.html\">expert on Palestinian political attitudes</a>, I believe the group now has few options to survive.</p>\n\n<p>Like former resistance groups in past peace processes, it could renounce arms and transform itself into a purely political party. But to do so, it needs to overcome a series of hurdles: confronting other parts of Trump’s plan, its unpopularity at home and its rigid ideology being the three most prominent. </p>\n\n<h2>Campaign of assassination</h2>\n\n<p>It is worth taking stock of just how degraded Hamas has become as the result of two years of onslaught by Israel’s vastly superior military.</p>\n\n<p>According to many intelligence reports, Hamas has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-11/israel-qatar-doha-strike-impact-unclear-as-hamas-still-in-gaza/105759734\">lost most of its senior command</a> in the Al-Qassam Brigades, its military wing. <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjz2wbcqeg\">Izz al-Din al-Haddad</a>, its current commander, survives, having presumably taken over from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-confirms-death-its-military-leader-mohammed-sinwar-2025-08-30/\">Mohammed Sinwar</a> – the brother of Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of Oct. 7 attack – who was killed in May 2025. But he presides over a dwindling army.</p>\n\n<p>Trump may not have been exaggerating when he indicated on Truth Social on Oct. 3 that Hamas had <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-puts-hamas-on-notice-deadline-accept-gaza-peace-deal\">lost 25,000 fighters</a>. Estimates regarding the group’s losses vary, but it <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47828\">could represent more than half</a> of the fighting force it had at the beginning of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-has-added-up-15000-fighters-since-start-war-us-figures-show-2025-01-24/\">recruiting new fighters</a> during that time. But many of these new recruits lack the competence and the experience of the dead ones. And the only motivations the new recruits have are hate and anger toward Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ political leadership has also been decimated. Chief political leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk\">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-67868754\">Saleh al-Arouri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67473719\">Yahya Sinwar</a>, have all been killed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"people walk on street past large billboard depicting slain anti-Israel leaders\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Iranians walk past a billboard of the slain leaders of anti-Israeli groups, including former Hamas political chief Yahya Sinwar.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/iranian-people-commute-past-a-massive-billboard-of-the-news-photo/2212286968?adppopup=true\">Mohammadali Najib/Middle East Images via AFP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>And it could have been worse.

But the operation missed its primary targets there.</p>\n\n<h2>Falling support in Gaza</h2>\n\n<p>Palestinian public pressure on Hamas has risen as the miseries of war have mounted. </p>\n\n<p>According to local health officials, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/after-false-dawns-gazans-hope-trump-will-force-end-two-year-old-war-2025-10-04/\">more than 67,000</a> have been killed and more than 169,000 have been injured. Most of the Gaza Strip has been reduced to rubble, and more than <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/trauma-repeated-displacement-gaza\">90% of the population has been displaced multiple times</a> – with most residents now living in tents. International organizations have reported famine and starvation in some parts of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has lost its power and influence over many areas now under Israeli control. Israeli military and intelligence have encouraged some members of the local Palestinian clans and militia to offer services in militia-controlled areas.</p>\n\n<p>In such areas, Hamas fighters have often <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/weakened-hamas-faces-rebel-clans-doubts-over-tehrans-backing-after-israel-iran-war/\">clashed with other Palestinian groups</a>, resulting in many deaths and growing resentment toward Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hamas-led-authorities-execute-alleged-collaborators-gaza-official-says-2025-09-22/\">execution and torture of Palestinians</a> suspected of collaboration with Israel has only worsened the situation, leading to chaos and lawlessness in many parts of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>It is little wonder, then, that half of Palestinians in Gazan <a href=\"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/997\">in the latest poll of attitudes</a> – taken in May 2025 – say they supported anti-Hamas demonstrations. Indeed, support for the group in both Gaza and the West Bank has continued to decline as the war has progressed.</p>\n\n<h2>The push for peace</h2>\n\n<p>The ongoing war and the inhumane daily conditions that local Palestinians in Gaza are dealing with have led to exhaustion and fatigue among the public.</p>\n\n<p>On social media, many Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/world/middleeast/palestinian-voices-hamas-cease-fire.html\">are asking Hamas publicly to endorse</a> the Trump plan and put an end to their misery. </p>\n\n<p>In deciding whether to accept all the plan’s 20 points, Hamas will, from its perspective, have to weigh whether agreeing to a very bad outcome is better than the alternative. Trump has warned that a failure to get on board will <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/03/trump-gives-hamas-sunday-6p-m-deadline-to-accept-his-peace-plan-00592887\">cause Hamas to face “all hell</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has already agreed to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq7zp7002o\">release the remaining Israeli hostages</a> and to relinquish power in Gaza to a technocratic Palestinian committee. If endorsed in full, this would put an end to the war and see the gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and no expulsion of the Palestinians out of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have been facilitating Hamas’ response to the plan. And there is huge regional and international pressure to get the deal over the line.</p>\n\n<p>However, it would force Hamas to disarm itself and allow the entry of an international and regional force into Gaza to oversee the destruction of military infrastructure, including tunnels, weapons manufacturing and the remaining rockets – points of the latest plan that Hamas <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce35nx49reko\">appears more unwilling to accept</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What happens to the remaining Hamas fighters is a sticking point that might lead to the collapse of the whole plan. </p>\n\n<p>And any rejection of the plan that can be blamed on Hamas will no doubt be welcomed by members of the Israeli extreme right. Hard-line factions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition have an alternative plan: to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/what-do-israelis-military-think-of-netanyahus-plan-to-occupy\">fully occupy Gaza</a>, expel the Palestinians and reestablish Israeli settlements in Gaza.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men in suits stand with thumbs up gestures\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled the peace plan at the White House on Sept. 29, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-greets-israeli-prime-minister-news-photo/2238074428?adppopup=true\">Win McNamee/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Where next for Hamas?</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most viable option for Hamas is to transform itself into a political party. But to do so, the group will need to reform not only its structures but also its ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Political momentum is swinging back to a two-state solution. <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/international/article-868328\">France and Saudi Arabia</a> recently spearheaded a fresh push to that end at the United Nations, and a host of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk-france-and-other-western-nations-recognize-palestinian-state-ahead-of-un-meetings-but-symbolic-action-wont-make-statehood-happen-265534\">Western nations recognized Palestinian statehood</a> for the first time. Hamas may feel the pressure to finally accept a two-state solution, something it has <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240118-meshaal-hamas-rejects-two-state-solution/\">long resisted</a>. For its part, Trump’s plan only makes vague assertions noting the Palestinian “aspiration” for a state.</p>\n\n<p>If transforming into a purely political party is to be the fate of Hamas, it will need to play its cards shrewdly and swiftly. The Palestine Liberation Organization went through this process after its departure from Beirut in 1982, eventually putting politics and diplomacy over armed resistance. And Qatar, Turkey and Egypt can help Hamas moderate its stances, too. </p>\n\n<p>The rigid ideology of Hamas remains a hurdle. Since it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/what-is-the-group-hamas-a-simple-guide-tothe-palestinian-group\">formed in 1987</a>, Hamas has tethered itself to a hard-line Islamist ideology that does not allow fundamental compromises on issues such as recognition of Israel and the development of Palestine as a secular state.</p>\n\n<p>But there is the recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/07/world/middleeast/syria-shara-authoritarian-reform.html\">example of Syria</a> where, following the ouster of long-term dictator Bashar Assad, the main Islamist fighting group pivoted to politics – and was lauded in the international community for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Whether Hamas can succeed in such a transformation – should it even attempt to – remains to be seen. And there is one final snag: Even if Hamas does accept the latest peace proposal, other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza might not – and could attempt to sabotage the whole process.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266515/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mkhaimar Abusada is affiliated with, Member of the Board of Commissioners of the Independent Commission for Human Rights, Palestine</span></em></p>",

In 2013, for example, the government shut down due to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-government-general-news-9f568e68401b4695ad8290e89169d9c2\">disputes over the Affordable Care Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This time around, the ACA continues to play a central role, with Democrats demanding, among other things, an extension of subsidies for ACA plan insurance premiums that are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\">set to expire at the end of 2025</a>. Democrats are also holding out to roll back <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-government-shut-down-healthcare-funding-americans-medicaid-obamacare-2025-10\">cuts to the Medicaid program</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, as part of what he called his “One Big Beautiful Bill.” </p>\n\n<p>Without a budget agreement in place, Trump ordered  <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/M-25-35-Status-of-Agency-Operations.pdf\">most federal agencies</a> to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-2025-whats-still-open-00195598\">wind down their nonessential activities</a>. The shutdown will continue until Congress passes either a short-term or long-term funding bill and Trump signs it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/longest-government-shutdown-us-history-president-administration-rcna234766\">Government shutdowns are nothing new</a>, but as a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QY68LSIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">health policy expert</a>, I worry this time around the impasse may have far-reaching effects on health care. </p>\n\n<p>Even as Democrats stage their battle over access to health care, the shutdown itself could also make it harder for Americans to get the care they need. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to use the crisis to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03192-4\">permanently cut federal jobs on a mass scale</a>, including ones in the health care sector, which could substantially reshape federal health agencies and their ability to protect Americans’ health.</p>\n\n<h2>The partisan health care divide</h2>\n\n<p>Historically, questions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2882219\">how the government should support access to health care</a> have long been a source of conflict between the two main political parties. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psj.12385\">passage of the ACA in 2010 and its implementation</a> have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-12166741\">only intensified this friction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the lead-up to the current shutdown, Republicans <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-vote-government-shutdown/\">needed Democratic votes in the Senate</a> to pass a bill that would <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/shutdown-near-certain-after-senate-again-rejects-funding-bills-00589136\">keep funding the government at existing levels at least until November</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In return for their support, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/shutdown-near-certain-after-senate-again-rejects-funding-bills-00589136\">sought several concessions</a>. A major one was to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">extend subsidies for ACA insurance policy premiums</a>, which were established during the COVID-19 pandemic. These subsidies addressed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00446.x\">shortcoming in the ACA</a> by decreasing premiums for millions of Americans – and they played a crucial role in <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/enrollment-growth-in-the-aca-marketplaces/\">more than doubling enrollment in the ACA marketplaces</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Without this extension, ACA premiums are set to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/how-much-more-would-people-pay-in-premiums-if-the-acas-enhanced-subsidies-expired/\">rise by more than 75% in 2026</a>, and the Congressional Budget Office estimated that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/how-will-the-2025-budget-reconciliation-affect-the-aca-medicaid-and-the-uninsured-rate/\">4.2 million Americans would lose insurance</a>. At least <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/why-might-republicans-consider-extending-obamacare-tax-credits/\">some Republicans seemed open to considering the ACA subsidies</a>, particularly those from districts that were more moderate and that had large <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/10/02/breaking-down-the-aca-subsidy-fight-00590901\">numbers of people enrolled in ACA plans</a>.

The other allowed people to receive services <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/30/hospital-at-home-program-winds-down-medicare-waiver-expires/\">at home that are generally provided in a hospital</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, most seniors will continue to receive Social Security payments. However, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/01/federal-government-shutdown-trump-congress-live-updates/86442840007/\">providers might be hesitant to schedule patients</a> covered by Medicare if the shutdown drags on over a long period of time. This is because <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-affects-medicare-medicaid/86435794007/\">payments to medical providers would likely be delayed</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What health services will continue to function?</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has indicated that there is <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-cms-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">enough funding for Medicaid</a>, the government program that primarily provides <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-10637708\">health services to low-income Americans</a>, to support the program through the end of the calendar year. If the shutdown lasts beyond that, states may have to decide whether to temporarily fund the program on their own or whether to reduce or delay provider payments. However, no previous shutdown has ever lasted <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/longest-government-shutdown-us-history-president-administration-rcna234766\">more than 34 days</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/117676\">Community health centers</a> are  generally expected to receive some funding, at least for now. These providers offer nonemergency medical services for <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/community-health-centers-provide-primary-care-to-nearly-34-million-patients\">about 34 million Americans each year</a>. Many also provide important <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13478\">services across the nation’s schools</a>. However, if <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/117676\">the standoff continues for more than a few days</a>, those centers may struggle to keep their doors open. </p>\n\n<p>Health and Human Services has also indicated that it will use all available funding to maintain “<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">minimal readiness for all hazards</a>” and will <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">maintain certain medical services</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/\">Indian Health Service</a>. The Veterans Health Administration will also stay open. One of the agencies <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/07/fda-job-cuts-morale-low-staff-anxious-impact-of-new-leadership-makary-prasad-rfk-jr/\">most affected by previous layoffs</a>, the Food and Drug Administration, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/fda-chief-calls-agency-exempt-from-looming-government-shutdown\">has indicated that it would be exempt from further cuts</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A longer-term view</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the severity of the shutdown’s effects on health care will depend on how long it lasts.  </p>\n\n<p>It will also depend on whether Trump makes good on his stated intention to use the shutdown as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/trump-vought-shutdown-cuts.html\">an unprecedented opportunity” to reshape the federal bureaucracy</a>. The White House announced plans for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-government-shutdown-firings-layoffs-vought-1fd57313272ec4db5984f653b095be33\">potential mass firings of workers</a>, particularly those at “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115304455138824245\">Democrat Agencies</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether this threat is simply a bargaining tactic remains to be seen, and it’s unclear whether health-related workers and agencies are in the crosshairs. But given that previous layoffs <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/massive-cuts-to-health-and-human-services-workforce-signal-a-dramatic-shift-in-us-health-policy-253316\">specifically targeted health programs</a>, more permanent reductions in programs that affect health care may be on the way.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266565/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Simon F.

Joseph Larkin of the Philadelphia Police Department’s subway unit visited the Philadelphia High School for Girls to interview the school’s librarian, 61-year-old Miriam S. Axelrod. </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod had written a letter to Mayor James H.J. Tate about poor conditions on Philadelphia’s Broad Street Line subway. In her letter, she stated that the escalators in the subway concourse of the <a href=\"https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/collection/p15037coll3/id/65942/rec/52\">Walnut-Locust station</a> were out of operation for several weeks and requested that they “be put in running order.” </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod also asked that “something be done” about people using the subway stairs “as a latrine.” </p>\n\n<p>As a historian of <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479823987/hope-and-struggle-in-the-policed-city/\">post-1968 Philadelphia</a>, a proud alumna of Girls’ High and a rider of Philadelphia’s mass transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority – more commonly known as SEPTA – I was thrilled to find Axelrod’s story among 1960s administrative reports to the police commissioner in the <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">city archives</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod’s story reminds us that for nearly a century, Philadelphia’s mass transit has been plagued by poor conditions and unstable funding. Commuters’ complaints have <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181060788/\">often convinced government officials to act</a>. However, no effective plan has ever been implemented to definitively solve the city’s transit crises.</p>\n\n<h2>SEPTA’s current turmoil</h2>\n\n<p>On Sept. 15, 2025, SEPTA fully restored its service, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/septa-cuts-reversal-judge-lawsuit-20250904.html#loaded\">by court order</a>, after implementing 20% service reductions and a 21.5% fare increase due to a <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-septa-shapiro-funds-request/\">US$213 million budget deficit</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Service cuts began on Aug. 24, just one day before public school students returned to classrooms. This left <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SEPTA-Title-VI-Analysis_Final_250508_rev.pdf\">kids, seniors and people from nonwhite, working-class communities</a> with few alternative routes.

For weeks, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/newsletters/morning/septa-pennsylvania-public-transportation-trust-fund-bill-ban-ice-masks-20250815.html\">state legislators could not agree on how to fund SEPTA within the state budget</a>. City officials, transit executives and tourism experts advocated for a bailout because Pennsylvania will reap tax revenue when <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-city-council-septa-cuts-funding/\">Philly hosts millions of tourists</a> in 2026 for America’s 250th birthday, the FIFA World Cup and the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Gov. Josh Shapiro authorized the use of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s capital funds <a href=\"https://www.pa.gov/governor/newsroom/2025-press-releases/shapiro-admin-approves-septa--394-million-capital-funding-mainta\">to finance SEPTA’s operations through June 2027</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Some lawmakers have argued that SEPTA is guilty of <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/inq2/pennsylvania-transit-agencies-state-funding-20250618.html\">mismanaging funds</a>, since the agency already received over $1 billion in state subsidies last year for operating assistance and asset improvement.</p>\n\n<h2>Public transport in the 1920s</h2>\n\n<p>As a longtime Philadelphian who lived in Center City, Miriam Axelrod was familiar with the strengths and shortcomings of public transportation. </p>\n\n<p>At the age of 4, her family emigrated from Russia to Carmel, New Jersey. By 1920, they made Philadelphia their home just as <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2020/01/18/philadelphia-census-records/\">the city’s Russian community became the largest immigrant group</a> due to Jewish people escaping pogroms in Europe. Axelrod grew up living in South and North Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p>At that time, dozens of private transit companies operated in Philly.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Penn operated city buses. Red Arrow provided suburban trolley service. Pennsylvania and Reading railroads offered high-speed rail lines. The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. alone brokered deals with <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181240112/\">64 underlying companies</a> to annually rent their services under 999-year leases. Fiscal responsibility for quality transportation was complicated and often dependent on public funding. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">During PRT’s early years</a>, it paid the city $15,000 annually for snow removal. In return, the city spent $2 million for street paving and bridge repairs.  </p>\n\n<p>By 1922, the PRT and the city had built and unified two elevated train routes – with assistance from the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/philadelphiasrap00arnorich/philadelphiasrap00arnorich/page/n7/mode/2up?view=theater\">Union Traction Co. and the Market Street Elevated Passenger Railway Co.</a> – to create the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080328134244/http://www.septa.org/inside/history/mfse.html\">Market-Frankford Elevated Train Line</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A page from a high school yearbook with photos of three young women\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Classmates at William Penn remembered Miriam Axelrod’s ‘remarkable capacity for starting arguments.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/\">Ancestry.com, U.S. School Yearbooks, 1900-2016</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>That was the same year Axelrod graduated from William Penn High School for Girls.

PRT later went to court to request a <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182144311/\">consolidation plan</a>. To make matters worse, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182143764/\">PRT had spent approximately $230 million from 1902 through 1939</a>, but that didn’t include spending to modernize old transit equipment. </p>\n\n<p>On Jan. 1, 1940, the <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181240622/\">Philadelphia Transportation Co.</a>, a private company with a 21-member board of directors that included five city representatives including the mayor, Robert E. Lamberton, merged the transit companies and took over PRT’s operations. <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501702402/running-the-rails/#bookTabs=1\">PTC became responsible</a> for 10,000 employees and providing transportation for 2 million passengers a day.</p>\n\n<p>PTC also acquired <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182143764/\">extensive financial responsibilities</a>. Payroll expenses cost $327,000 each week. The annual rate for leasing the subway and El was roughly $3 million. PTC had to provide its 25,000 bondholders an annual income of at least $959,207 while also fulfilling its promise to offer modern transit vehicles.</p>\n\n<h2>Overcrowding and frequent fare increases</h2>\n\n<p>During the 1940s through the 1960s, Axelrod took public transportation to her job as a librarian at Central High School and later Frankford High School. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, PTC made good on its promise to provide better transit service. In its first eight years of operation, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181285344/\">PTC spent $22.8 million</a> to purchase 1,506 new streetcars, buses and trackless trolleys while also improving terminal and plant facilities. The company even purchased advertisements in The Philadelphia Inquirer to highlight its achievements. PTC extended 38 existing routes and created 18 new routes that serviced old residential and industrial areas, along with newly developed neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>By 1949, however, many of PTC’s 3.2 million daily riders <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181285244/\">were complaining</a> about overcrowded subways, the end of free exchanges between popular routes and frequent fare increases. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black and white photo of men and women, some reading newspapers, in a subway car\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Passengers ride a subway car in Philadelphia on Feb. 15, 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Subway/ce8c9f79259843c3a038d9e4cbe967ad/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Both PTC and the city faced scrutiny for these issues, although each party had distinct transit obligations outlined in their joint contract. PTC had to provide “safe and adequate service” that included spending on maintenance and replacement of transit equipment. The city was responsible for police and fire services on mass transit along with auditing PTC’s records. Both parties had to agree on fare changes under the state Public Utility Commission’s supervision. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, when issues on mass transit occurred, the city could persuade PTC to improve conditions, but the city was only required to offer emergency services to commuters. </p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">Larkin personally addressed Axelrod’s 1967 complaint</a> about the subway, he informed her that the United Elevator Co. was repairing the escalators. He also assured her that the subway unit arrested 45 to 50 intoxicated people each month because they were at risk of falling onto the subway tracks. In “isolated cases,” Larkin explained, police arrested people for public urination and defecation. </p>\n\n<p>Larkin reassured Axelrod that PTC could keep subway conditions clean and under control. In reality, PTC was underwater in responsibilities and debt. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 30, 1968, SEPTA, a state agency formed five years earlier, took over PTC and managed transportation for the city and its surrounding areas. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190809161808/http://www.septa.org/media/50th/pictures/1968%20septa%20article%20B%26W.jpg\">SEPTA bought PTC for approximately $47.9 million</a>, settling the company’s debt, accepting its pension liability and <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182139333/\">buying out the institution’s roughly 1.7 million shareholders</a>. Now federal and state funding rather than fare revenue largely determined the quality of the city’s public transit.</p>\n\n<h2>Decades of unpredictable funding</h2>\n\n<p>Since the 1960s, annual government funding to SEPTA has been unpredictable. <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9780807871904/philadelphia-divided/\">White flight</a>, <a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reshaping-ethnic-and-racial-relations-in-philadelphia\">deindustrialization</a> and job flight have <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/philadelphia300y00weig/page/704/mode/2up?q=wolf\">contributed to depopulation</a>, a declining tax base and <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479823987/hope-and-struggle-in-the-policed-city/\">government defunding of social programs</a> in Philadelphia. These socioeconomic shifts continue to affect Philadelphia’s budget for education, public housing and recreation as well as <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/news/septa-board-approves-fiscal-year-2025-operating-capital-budgets-safe-clean-secure/\">SEPTA’s $2.743 billion budget</a> as a public transit agency.</p>\n\n<p>Five counties in Greater Philadelphia contribute subsidies to SEPTA in exchange for transit service. Philadelphia alone <a href=\"https://seventy.org/uploads/attachments/clmt8ss9401fk4wnpfzbicd6q-how-philly-works-101.pdf\">contributes $110 million</a>. State subsidies also help <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/wp-content/uploads/page/planning/FY-2025-Budget-Book-Amendment-Full.pdf\">finance SEPTA’s</a> $1.74 billion operating budget, while federal subsidies support SEPTA’s $1 billion capital budget to pay for major repairs and new equipment. State politicians annually vote on funding for SEPTA, but there has not been a concrete solution to the funding crisis.</p>\n\n<p>For years, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181233736/\">politicians have proposed using county sales and gas taxes</a> along with business licensing fees to fund mass transit, without success. Additionally, since 2008 <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/infographics-who-drives-in-philadelphia-and-who-doesn-t/\">rising rates of car ownership</a> have also led to fewer commuters and reduced fare revenues for SEPTA. </p>\n\n<p>However, Philadelphians never ceased to demand better transit service. During the 1980s, the Pennsylvania Public Interest Coalition established <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181465714/\">the Transit Riders Action Campaign</a>, also known as TRAC, which advocated that SEPTA have better safety, funding, accountability, service and stable fares. The Transport Workers Union Local 234 advised TRAC, while several organizations partnered with them: the Action Alliance of Senior Citizens, the Clean Air Council, Disabled in Action and the Delaware Valley Interfaith Coalition. </p>\n\n<p>Even today, local groups such as <a href=\"https://savethetrain.org/\">Save the Train</a> with outspoken commuters – like Axelrod was in her day – have launched campaigns to halt service cutbacks and encourage residents to write and telephone legislators who can vote to fund SEPTA. Residents have consistently united to advocate for quality mass transit. All that remains is an agreement among lawmakers to make it possible.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264860/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Menika Dirkson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

While pushing for nearly three hours, I developed an infection in my uterus called <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12309-chorioamnionitis\">chorioamnionitis</a>, which occurs when bacteria infect the uterus, placenta and sometimes the baby’s bloodstream. I had a fever, and my baby’s heart rate was significantly elevated. </p>\n\n<p>I remember feeling delirious; my colleague and friend, while delivering my baby, said she had never seen me in such a state. I couldn’t focus on pushing. I felt faint, and I worried about my baby. </p>\n\n<p>And I remember the incredible relief that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, brought me when it lowered my fever and decreased my and my baby’s heart rate. After taking it, I was able to push with confidence and welcome my healthy daughter, who is now 7 and thriving. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/tami-rowen\">practicing obstetrician and medical researcher</a> with nearly two decades of experience taking care of pregnant patients, I have to make a dozen decisions about acetaminophen use on any given day when I am working in the hospital. I have examined the data as a researcher, clinician and educator. Central to our jobs is balancing the risks and benefits of any treatments. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s words will not change how I practice, but I worry they will sow confusion in my patients and create fear of potential lawsuits for all practicing health care providers.</p>\n\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the leading organization that guides medical decisions on pregnancy and childbirth, has reiterated the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy\">safety and efficacy of acetaminophen use during pregnancy</a> in light of the confusion surrounding Trump’s claims.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixed messages</h2>\n\n<p>I first looked into the data on the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tylenol-could-be-risky-for-pregnant-women-a-new-review-of-25-years-of-research-finds-acetaminophen-may-contribute-to-adhd-and-other-developmental-disorders-in-children-168820\">possible links between acetaminophen and developmental disorders</a> a few years ago when I received a call from a woman who had recently learned she was pregnant and had caught the flu from her toddler child. She was concerned that Tylenol was dangerous for her developing baby. </p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7\">studies do suggest links</a> between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\">acetaminophen use in pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders</a> such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. But they lack a crucial distinction.  </p>\n\n<p>For one, they cannot pin down whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy itself was associated with the neurodevelopmental conditions in the child, or whether the fevers and other symptoms that led people to use the painkiller were playing a role in the outcome. Secondly, because those studies are based on statistical associations rather than controlled experiments, they <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-parents-need-to-know-about-tylenol-autism-and-the-difference-between-finding-a-link-and-finding-a-cause-in-scientific-research-265946\">cannot show cause and effect</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Since it is both unethical and nonfeasible to perform a controlled study evaluating the actual risks of acetaminophen use, the best proxy to control for environmental or genetic factors is to look at maternal exposure to acetaminophen and outcomes of more than one child in individual families. </p>\n\n<p>That’s exactly what was done in a 2024 Swedish study that analyzed nearly 2.5 million children born from 1995 to 2019 in Sweden to mothers who had documented use of any medication during pregnancy. When looking at individual children, the researchers found up to a 5% increase in autism for those exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. However, when siblings were included in the analysis – controlling for environmental, medical and genetic factors that could have contributed – the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.3172\">small, elevated risk disappeared</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young boy and older girl stand together smiling in front of a house.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 2024 Swedish study found that when siblings were taken into account, the association between acetaminophen use and autism became insignificant.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-brother-and-sister-in-front-of-urban-royalty-free-image/1461191254?phrase=siblings&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">MoMo Productions/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fever during pregnancy is dangerous for mother and baby</h2>\n\n<p>There are many important reasons why doctors like me may recommend acetaminophen to a pregnant patient. One pregnant patient I treated who had the flu was so sick that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sepsis-still-kills-1-in-5-people-worldwide-two-icu-physicians-offer-a-new-approach-to-stopping-it-175650\">she was septic</a>, meaning an infection had spread throughout her body. Her 103-degree fever and dangerously low blood pressure threatened her and her fetus’s life. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I did not hesitate to treat her with acetaminophen. Our goal was to bring down not only her body temperature but also the fetus’s heart rate, since a high heart rate can place dangerous stress on the fetus.

Pregnant people suffer from kidney stones, appendicitis or dental cavities that require root canal, just like people who are not pregnant. Up to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-06151-x\">70% of pregnant people experience back pain</a>, which can leave them unable to perform normal daily activities and care for their children.

The anxiety and fear that people bring to my office and to the delivery room about the many uncertainties associated with pregnancy and childbirth is palpable and legitimate. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why it is critical that all recommendations are sound and evidence-based, with a clear understanding of the nuances and limitations of research studies. I know every time I look at my children I think of everything I can do to keep them safe, and I wonder what I could have done in the past to prevent any problems we currently face. We owe it to parents like me and all future parents to give them the most honest and scientific information possible.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265947/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tami S.

In 1922, <a href=\"https://muninn.net/thoughts/edison-predictions/\">Thomas Edison declared</a> that in the near future, all school textbooks would be replaced by film strips, because text was 2% efficient, but film was 100% efficient. Those bogus statistics are a good reminder that people can be brilliant technologists, while also being inept education reformers. </p>\n\n<p>I think of Edison whenever I hear technologists insisting that educators have to adopt artificial intelligence as rapidly as possible to get ahead of the transformation that’s about to wash over schools and society. </p>\n\n<p>At MIT, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ihnlfqIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">I study</a> <a href=\"https://tsl.mit.edu/books/failure-to-disrupt/\">the history and future of education technology</a>, and I have never encountered an example of a school system – a country, state or municipality – that rapidly adopted a new digital technology and saw durable benefits for their students. The first districts to encourage students to bring mobile phones to class did not better prepare youth for the future than schools that took a more cautious approach. There is no evidence that the first countries to connect their classrooms to the internet stand apart in economic growth, educational attainment or citizen well-being.</p>\n\n<p>New education technologies are only as powerful as the communities that guide their use. Opening a new browser tab is easy; creating the conditions for good learning is hard. </p>\n\n<p>It takes years for educators to develop new practices and norms, for students to adopt new routines, and for families to identify new support mechanisms in order for a novel invention to reliably improve learning. But as AI spreads through schools, both historical analysis and new research conducted with K-12 teachers and students offer some guidance on navigating uncertainties and minimizing harm.</p>\n\n<h2>We’ve been wrong and overconfident before</h2>\n\n<p>I started teaching high school history students to search the web in 2003. At the time, experts in library and information science developed a pedagogy for web evaluation that encouraged students to closely read websites looking for markers of credibility: citations, proper formatting, and an “about” page. We gave students checklists like <a href=\"https://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=loexquarterly\">the CRAAP test</a> – currency, reliability, authority, accuracy and purpose – to guide their evaluation. We taught students to avoid Wikipedia and to trust websites with .org or .edu domains over .com domains. It all seemed reasonable and evidence-informed at the time. </p>\n\n<p>The first peer-reviewed article demonstrating effective methods for teaching students <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1177/016146811912101102\">how to search the web was published in 2019</a>. It showed that novices who used these commonly taught techniques performed miserably in tests evaluating their ability to sort truth from fiction on the web. It also showed that experts in online information evaluation used a completely different approach: quickly leaving a page to see how other sources characterize it. That method, now called <a href=\"https://libguides.cmich.edu/web_research/lateral\">lateral reading</a>, resulted in faster, more accurate searching. The work was a gut punch for an old teacher like me. We’d spent nearly two decades teaching millions of students demonstrably ineffective ways of searching.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, there is a cottage industry of consultants, keynoters and “thought leaders” traveling the country purporting to train educators on how to use AI in schools. National and international organizations publish AI literacy frameworks claiming to know what skills students need for their future. Technologists invent apps that encourage teachers and students to use generative AI as tutors, as lesson planners, as writing editors, or as conversation partners. These approaches have about as much evidential support today as the CRAAP test did when it was invented. </p>\n\n<p>There is a better approach than making overconfident guesses: rigorously testing new practices and strategies and only widely advocating for the ones that have robust evidence of effectiveness. As with web literacy, that evidence will take a decade or more to emerge. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s a difference this time. AI is what I have called an “<a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/x6vn7_v1\">arrival technology</a>.” AI is not invited into schools through a process of adoption, like buying a desktop computer or smartboard – it crashes the party and then starts rearranging the furniture. That means schools have to do something. Teachers feel this urgently. Yet they also need support: Over the past two years, my team has interviewed nearly <a href=\"https://www.teachlabpodcast.com/\">100 educators from across the U.S.</a>, and one widespread refrain is “don’t make us go it alone.” </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"uF1Wc\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uF1Wc/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>3 strategies for prudent path forward</h2>\n\n<p>While waiting for better answers from the education science community, which will take years, teachers will have to be scientists themselves. I recommend three guideposts for moving forward with AI under conditions of uncertainty: humility, experimentation and assessment.</p>\n\n<p>First, regularly remind students and teachers that anything schools try – literacy frameworks, teaching practices, new assessments – <a href=\"https://tsl.mit.edu/ai-guidebook/\">is a best guess</a>. In four years, students might hear that what they were first taught about using AI has since proved to be quite wrong. We all need to be ready to revise our thinking.   </p>\n\n<p>Second, schools need to examine their students and curriculum, and decide what kinds of experiments they’d like to conduct with AI. Some parts of your curriculum might invite playfulness and bold new efforts, while others deserve more caution. </p>\n\n<p>In our podcast “The Homework Machine,” <a href=\"https://www.teachlabpodcast.com/the-homework-machine-ep-6-inviting-ai-to-the-party/\">we interviewed Eric Timmons</a>, a teacher in Santa Ana, California, who teaches elective filmmaking courses. His students’ final assessments are complex movies that require multiple technical and artistic skills to produce. An AI enthusiast, Timmons uses AI to develop his curriculum, and he encourages students to use AI tools to solve filmmaking problems, from scripting to technical design. He’s not worried about AI doing everything for students: As he says, “My students love to make movies. … So why would they replace that with AI?”</p>\n\n<p>It’s among the best, most thoughtful examples of an “all in” approach that I’ve encountered. I also can’t imagine recommending a similar approach for a course like ninth grade English, where the pivotal introduction to secondary school writing probably should be treated with more cautious approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Third, when teachers do launch new experiments, they should recognize that local assessment will happen much faster than rigorous science. Every time schools launch a new AI policy or teaching practice, educators should collect a pile of related student work that was developed before AI was used during teaching. If you let students use AI tools for formative feedback on science labs, grab a pile of circa-2022 lab reports. Then, collect the new lab reports. Review whether the post-AI lab reports <a href=\"https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.154x+3T2018/courseware/68505eb307434be7bb9db38cf6390153/f026ebd78d074718b2cbf0d18474fb45/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B11.154x%2B3T2018%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40f026ebd78d074718b2cbf0d18474fb45\">show an improvement on the outcomes you care about</a>, and revise practices accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>Between local educators and the international community of education scientists, people will learn a lot by 2035 about AI in schools. We might find that AI is like the web, a place with some risks but ultimately so full of important, useful resources that we continue to invite it into schools. Or we might find that AI is like cellphones, and the negative effects on <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4735240\">well-being and learning</a> ultimately outweigh the potential gains, and thus are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.5xc5dxfwu\">best treated with more aggressive restrictions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone in education feels an urgency to resolve the uncertainty around generative AI. But we don’t need a race to generate answers first – we need a race to be right.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265172/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Justin Reich has received funding from Google, Microsoft, Apple, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Chan/Zuckerberg Initiative, the Hewlett Foundation, education publishers, and other organizations that are involved in technology and schools. </span></em></p>",

The fossil evidence Darwin collected over his five-year journey eventually helped him to think about an <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin\">infinite variety of species</a>, both past and present.</p>\n\n<p>The HMS Beagle and its crew traversed these places while testing clocks and drawing maps for the Royal Navy, and the voyage was <a href=\"https://undsci.berkeley.edu/who-pays-for-science/\">funded by the British government</a>. Darwin’s position as a naturalist aboard the ship was unpaid, but, fortunately, his family’s private assets were enough to cover his living expenses while he focused on his scientific work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, government and private funding both remain important for scientific discoveries and translating knowledge into practical applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dE_Q4twAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">As a professor of science education</a>, one of my goals while preparing future teachers is to introduce them to the <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13165/chapter/7#78\">characteristics of scientific knowledge</a> and how it is developed. For decades, there has been a strong consensus in my field that educated citizens also <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/resources/science-all-americans\">need to know</a> about the nature of the scientific enterprise. This includes understanding who pays for science, which can differ depending on the type of research, and why it matters. </p>\n\n<p>Funding for science is more than just the amount of money. To a large extent, the organizations that fund research set the agenda, and different funders have different priorities. It can also be hard to see the downstream benefits of scientific research, but they typically outweigh the upfront costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic research leads to new knowledge</h2>\n\n<p>Basic research, also called fundamental research, involves systematic study aimed at acquiring new knowledge. Scientists often pursue research that falls into this category without specific applications or commercial objectives in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it costs money to follow where curiosity leads; <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-does-it-cost-to-run-a-lab\">scientists need funding</a> to pursue questions about the natural and material world. </p>\n\n<p>About 40% of basic research in the U.S. has been federally funded in recent years. The <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24332\">government makes this investment</a> because basic research is the foundation of long-term innovation, economic growth and societal well-being.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"7CZW2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7CZW2/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Funding for basic research is distributed by the federal government through several agencies and institutes. For more than a century, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/organization/history\">National Institutes of Health have sponsored</a> a breadth of scientific and health research and education programs. Since 1950, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/history\">National Science Foundation has advanced</a> basic research and education programs, including the training of the next generation of scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Other federal agencies have complementary missions, such as the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, created in response to the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957. DARPA focuses on technological innovations for national security, many of which have become fixtures of civilian life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/lifecycle-of-a-research-grant-behind-the-scenes-of-the-system-that-funds-science-255163\">Through a competitive review process</a> at these agencies, subject experts vet research proposals and make funding recommendations. The amount of funding available from the NIH, NSF and DARPA varies annually, depending on <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/process\">congressional appropriations</a>. Most of the awarded funds go to universities, research institutions and other health and science organizations that conduct research. The sum of research dollars awarded <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/federal-health-science-funding-states-map\">differs among states</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Applying research</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists undertake basic research to generate new knowledge with no specific end goal in mind. Applied research is different in that it aims to find solutions to real-world problems.</p>\n\n<p>Research that investigates specific, practical objectives or improvements with commercial potential is more likely to attract private investors. Companies directly invest in research and development to gain a competitive edge and turn a profit. Private industry is more likely to sink dollars into applied rather than basic research because the potential payoff in the form of a new product or advance is more visible. </p>\n\n<h2>From discovery to real-world implementation</h2>\n\n<p>As applied research addresses problems, promising findings are moved toward clinical application or mainstream use. This research and development process can lead to tangible benefits for individuals and society.</p>\n\n<p>Federal agencies such as the NIH make substantial investments in the basic and applied science underlying new drugs. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies heavily <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25353#\">invest in the development of drug candidates</a>. Recent reports have shown that <a href=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/phrma/fact-sheets/clinical-trials/TEConomy_PhRMA-_Biopharma-Industry-Sponsored-Clinical-Trials.2025-Report.Final_.pdf\">industry has been responsible for 50%</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ResearchAmerica-Investment-Report.Final_.January-2022-1.pdf\">or more</a> of the dollars invested in health and biomedical research in recent years. This expenditure includes significant <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.1921\">spending to advance clinical trials</a> – the studies that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-clinical-trial-a-health-policy-expert-explains-137221\">test new medical treatments</a> before they get approved for use. </p>\n\n<p>The NIH funded basic research that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1715368115\">contributed to every single drug approved</a> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2016. This includes key work that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/get-smart/vaccines\">led to COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign likely <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations\">saved the U.S. more than $1 trillion</a> in health care expenses that would have otherwise been incurred and also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223\">saved lives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Initial NSF investments in research was instrumental in <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/astronomy-space/black-holes\">capturing images of black holes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/oceans\">exploring deep oceans</a>. Basic research funded by NSF paved the way for everyday conveniences such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/science-matters/pocket-sized-progress-smartphones-nsf-innovations\">smartphones</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/origins-google\">Google search engine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/ai\">artificial intelligence</a>. Other funded projects led to quality of life improvements such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/asl\">American Sign Language</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/kidney-exchanges\">kidney matching</a> for transplants. <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/beyond-the-classroom\">Educational programming</a>, such as “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and “The Magic School Bus,” were NSF-backed projects, too. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CLOMZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CLOMZ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>It matters who pays: Funding shapes science</h2>\n\n<p>Funders and financial systems shape the trajectory of research across fields.

What happens to these particles within atoms would stay unexplained without this tool. The calculations using virtual particles predict the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles with such uncanny accuracy that some scientists think “they must really exist.”</p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are not real – it says so right in their name – but if you want to understand how real particles interact with each other, they are unavoidable. They are essential tools to describe three of the forces found in nature: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-electromagnetic-force\">electromagnetism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-strong-force\">the strong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-weak-force\">weak nuclear</a> forces. </p>\n\n<p>Real particles are lumps of energy that can be “seen” or detected by appropriate instruments; this feature is what makes them observable, or real. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are a sophisticated mathematical tool and cannot be seen. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Feynman\">Physicist Richard Feynman</a> invented them to describe the interactions between real particles.</p>\n\n<p>But many physicists are not convinced by this cut-and-dried distinction. \nAlthough researchers can’t detect these virtual particles, as tools of calculation they <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2022-06-quantum-electrodynamics-accurately.html\">predict many subtle effects</a> that ultrasensitive experiments have confirmed to a mind-boggling 12 decimal places. That precision is like measuring the distance between the North and South poles to better than the width of a single hair.</p>\n\n<p>This level of agreement between measurements and calculations makes virtual particles the most thoroughly vetted idea in science. It forces some physicists to ask: Can a mathematical tool become real?</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayQhNLqbTFk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles help scientists follow the interactions between particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A bookkeeping tool</h2>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are the tool that physicists use to calculate how forces work in the microscopic subatomic world. The forces are real because they can be measured.</p>\n\n<p>But instead of trying to calculate the forces directly, physicists use a bookkeeping system where short-lived virtual particles carry the force. Not only do virtual particles make the calculations more manageable, they also resolve a long-standing problem in physics: How does a force act across empty space? </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles exploit the <a href=\"https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/uncertainty-principle\">natural fuzziness of the subatomic world</a>, where if these ephemeral particles live briefly enough, they can also briefly <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2014-07-boosting-space.html\">borrow their energy from empty space</a>. The haziness of the energy balance <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834383-000-why-virtual-particles-dont-exist-but-do-explain-reality-for-now/\">hides this brief imbalance</a>, which allows the virtual particles to influence the real world. </p>\n\n<p>One big advantage of this tool is that the mathematical operations describing the forces between particles can be visualized as diagrams. They tend to look like stick-figure cartoons of particle pingpong played with virtual particles. The diagrams – dubbed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe7atm1x6Mg\">Feynman diagrams</a> – offer an excellent intuitive framework, but they also give virtual particles an aura of reality that is deceiving. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe7atm1x6Mg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Feynman diagrams help physicists calculate particle interactions.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Amazingly, this virtual particle-based method for calculation produces some of the most precise predictions in all of science. </p>\n\n<h2>Reality check</h2>\n\n<p>All matter is made of basic building blocks called atoms. Atoms, in turn, are made of small <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">positively charged particles called protons</a> found at their core, surrounded by even smaller <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainselectrons\">negatively charged particles called electrons</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a professor of <a href=\"https://dd285.physics.msstate.edu\">physics and astronomy at Mississippi State University</a>, I perform experiments that often rely on the idea that the electrons and protons seen in our instruments interact by swapping virtual particles. My colleagues and I have recently measured the <a href=\"https://www.jlab.org/new-measurement-fits-another-piece-proton-radius-puzzle\">size of the proton</a> very precisely, by bombarding hydrogen atoms with a beam of electrons. This measurement assumes that the electrons can “feel” the proton at the center of the hydrogen atom by exchanging virtual photons: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsphotons\">particles of electromagnetic energy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Physicists use virtual particles to calculate how two electrons repel each other, with exquisite precision. The forces involved are represented as the accumulated effect of the two electrons trading virtual photons.</p>\n\n<p>When two metal plates are placed extremely close together in a vacuum, they attract each other: This is known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.4656\">Casimir effect</a>. Physicists can accurately calculate the force that pulls the plates together using virtual particle mathematics. Whether the virtual particles are really there or not, the math predicts exactly what researchers observe in the real world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of two black circles merging in space\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles can help explain how black holes act.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://mediaassets.caltech.edu/gwave\">SXS</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet another mysterious prediction made using the virtual particle tool kit is so-called <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/hawking-radiation\">Hawking radiation</a>. When virtual particle pairs pop into existence at the edge of black holes, sometimes the black hole’s gravity grabs one partner while the other escapes. This rift causes the black hole to slowly evaporate. Although Hawking radiation has not yet been directly observed, researchers have recently <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/hawkings-black-hole-theorem-confirm-0701\">observed it indirectly</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Useful fiction</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s circle back to the question: Can a mathematical tool become real? If you can perfectly predict everything about a force by imagining it is carried by virtual particles, do these particles qualify as real? Does their fictional status matter? </p>\n\n<p>Physicists remain divided on these questions. Some prefer to “just shut up and calculate” – one of Feynman’s famous quips. For now, virtual particles are our best way to describe how particles behave. But researchers are developing <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/\">alternative methods</a> that do not need them at all. </p>\n\n<p>If successful, these approaches could make virtual particles vanish for good. Successful or not, the fact that alternatives exist at all suggests virtual particles might be useful fiction rather than physical truth. It also fits the pattern of previous revolutions in science – the example of ether comes to mind. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/ether-theoretical-substance\">Physicists invented ether</a> as a medium through which light waves traveled. Experiments matched well with calculations using this tool, yet they could not actually detect it. Eventually, Einstein’s theory of relativity showed it was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are a striking paradox of modern physics. They shouldn’t exist, yet they are indispensable for calculating everything from the strength of magnets to the behavior of black holes. They represent a profound dilemma: Sometimes the best insights into reality come through carefully constructed illusion. In the end, confusion around virtual particles may be just the price of understanding fundamental forces.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264739/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dipangkar Dutta receives funding from US Dept. of Energy and NSF. </span></em></p>",

The contents spill onto the table, bench and floor. It’s a chaotic – but functional – solution to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Children have a penchant for unconventional thinking that, at first glance, can look disordered. This kind of apparently chaotic behavior served as the inspiration for developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a>’s best-known theory: that children construct their knowledge through experience and must pass through <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/2672709\">four sequential stages</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/X7rU9Wvm94M\">first two of which</a> lack the ability to use structured logic.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget remains the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.004\">GOAT of developmental psychology</a>. He fundamentally and forever changed the world’s view of children by showing that kids do not enter the world with the same conceptual building blocks as adults, but must construct them through experience. No one before or since has amassed such a <a href=\"https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Jean+Piaget%22\">catalog of quirky child behaviors</a> that researchers even today can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00359.x\">replicate within individual children</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While Piaget was certainly correct in observing that children engage in a host of unusual behaviors, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXEkpesAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">my</a> <a href=\"https://www.kiddlab.com/\">lab</a> recently uncovered evidence that upends some long-standing assumptions about the limits of children’s logical capabilities that originated with his work. Our new paper in the journal Nature Human Behaviour describes how young children are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02302-6\">capable of finding systematic solutions</a> to complex problems without any instruction.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb4TPj1pxzQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jean Piaget describes how children of different ages tackle a sorting task, with varying success.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Putting things in order</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout the 1960s, Piaget observed that young children rely on <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">clunky trial-and-error methods</a> rather than systematic strategies when attempting to order objects according to some continuous quantitative dimension, like length. For instance, a 4-year-old child asked to organize sticks from shortest to longest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb4TPj1pxzQ\">will move them around randomly</a> and usually not achieve the desired final order. </p>\n\n<p>Psychologists have interpreted young children’s inefficient behavior in this kind of ordering task – what we call a seriation task – as an indicator that kids can’t use systematic strategies in problem-solving <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">until at least age 7</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, my colleagues and I found that increasing the difficulty and cognitive demands of the seriation task actually prompted young children to discover and use algorithmic solutions to solve it.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget’s classic study asked children to put some visible items like wooden sticks in order by height. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3BT7I0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Huiwen Alex Yang</a>, a psychology Ph.D. candidate who works on computational models of learning in my lab, cranked up the difficulty for our version of the task. With advice from our collaborator <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vOHeGXcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Bill Thompson</a>, Yang designed a computer game that required children to use feedback clues to infer the height order of items hidden behind a wall, . </p>\n\n<p>The game asked children to order bunnylike creatures from shortest to tallest by clicking on their sneakers to swap their places. The creatures only changed places if they were in the wrong order; otherwise they stayed put. Because they could only see the bunnies’ shoes and not their heights, children had to rely on logical inference rather than direct observation to solve the task. Yang tested 123 children between the ages of 4 and 10. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlsbcE6nOxk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Researcher Huiwen Alex Yang tests 8-year-old Miro on the bunny sorting task. The bunnies are hidden behind a wall with only their sneakers visible. Miro’s selections exemplify use of selection sort, a classic efficient sorting algorithm from computer science. <em>Kidd Lab at UC Berkeley.</em></span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Figuring out a strategy</h2>\n\n<p>We found that children independently discovered and applied at least two well-known sorting algorithms. These strategies – called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort\">selection sort</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort\">shaker sort</a> – are typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn0915\">studied in computer science</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More than half the children we tested demonstrated evidence of structured algorithmic thinking, and at ages as young as 4 years old. While older kids were more likely to use algorithmic strategies, our finding contrasts with Piaget’s belief that children were incapable of this kind of systematic strategizing before 7 years of age. He thought kids needed to reach what he called the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/concrete-operational-stage\">concrete operational</a> stage of development first.</p>\n\n<p>Our results suggest that children are actually capable of spontaneous logical strategy discovery much earlier when circumstances require it. In our task, a trial-and-error strategy could not work because the objects to be ordered were not directly observable; children could not rely on perceptual feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Explaining our results requires a more nuanced interpretation of Piaget’s original data. While children may still favor apparently less logical solutions to problems during the first two Piagetian stages, it’s not because they are incapable of doing otherwise if the situation requires it.</p>\n\n<h2>A systematic approach to life</h2>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is crucial not only in high-level math classes, but also in everyday life. Imagine that you need to bake two dozen cookies, but your go-to recipe yields only one. You could go through all the steps of making the recipe twice, washing the bowl in between, but you’d never do that because you know that would be inefficient. Instead, you’d double the ingredients and perform each step only once. Algorithmic thinking allows you to identify a systematic way of approaching the need for twice as many cookies that improves the efficiency of your baking.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is an important capacity that’s useful to children as they learn to move and operate in the world – and we now know they have access to these abilities far earlier than psychologists had believed. </p>\n\n<p>That children can engage with algorithmic thinking before formal instruction has important implications for STEM – science, technology, engineering and math –education. Caregivers and educators now need to reconsider when and how they give children the opportunity to tackle more abstract problems and concepts. Knowing that children’s minds are ready for structured problems as early as preschool means we can nurture these abilities earlier in support of stronger math and computational skills. </p>\n\n<p>And have some patience next time you encounter children interacting with the world in ways that are perhaps not super convenient. As you pick up your belongings from a café floor, remember that it’s all part of how children construct their knowledge. Those seemingly chaotic kids are on their way to more obviously logical behavior soon.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266438/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Celeste Kidd receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the Jacobs Foundation, and the Advanced Research and Invention Agency. </span></em></p>",

North and central Florida <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2024/on-the-history-science-wonderment-florida-springs.aspx\">comprise one of the largest concentrations</a> of freshwater springs in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these springs provide a home to a variety of wild animals and plants. But they are also canaries in the coal mine for Florida’s groundwater system, because they draw upon the same groundwater that many Floridians depend on for drinking water, farm irrigation and industrial use.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, many Florida springs suffer from <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/how-are-floridas-springs-threatened\">reduced flow and habitat loss, as well as excessive algae and heavy pressure from human use</a>. Because most of the state’s springs are not monitored by any research institution or government agency, the full scope of the problem remains unclear.</p>\n\n<p>The state Legislature has designated 30 <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/owper/water-policy/content/outstanding-florida-springs-ofs\">Outstanding Florida Springs</a> whose health must be protected under the <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0300-0399/0373/0373PARTVIIIContentsIndex.html\">Florida Springs and Aquifer Protection Act of 2016</a>. But <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/springs\">24 of the 30 were impaired</a> by pollution – primarily nitrogen – at the time of this designation, and today, their condition has not improved.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, 26 of the 30 – the same 24 springs, plus two more – <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3943/2025_Santa_Fe_River_BMAP_%281%29.pdf?1758919604\">have been found</a> <a href=\"https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/07/10/dep-once-again-fails-florida-springs-wont-push-polluters/#:%7E:text=Alarmed%20by%20the%20trend%2C%20in,now%20includes%20a%2025th%20spring.\">to be impaired</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3945/LithiaBuckhornSprings.pdf?1759333546\">According to</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3946/TBEP_10_00CrystalSprings.pdf?1759333573\">multiple reports</a> and my own observation, many other popular springs are impaired by pollution as well. Since 2011, the state of Florida <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/Springs%20Fact%20Sheet%201.pdf\">has spent roughly US$357 million</a> on springs restoration.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8IvzdbAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">geography professor</a>, I study springs in the context of people and their use of water. My research has taught me that Florida’s springs vary based on location and local circumstances. Because of this, I believe reviving their health will require several multidimensional solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>Recalling healthy springs</h2>\n\n<p>What should a healthy spring look like? The answer to this can be harder to articulate than you might think. Many springs feature a visible boil at the water surface above the spring vent, crystal clear water, submerged grasses waving in the current, and a range of fish, turtles, snails and other aquatic animals hiding in the grasses.</p>\n\n<p>Yet because many springs are changing slowly, changes in flow and water clarity can go unnoticed. Some scientists call this the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/shifting-baseline.htm\">shifting baseline syndrome</a>: Each generation perceives springs in a slightly more degraded state, but absent prior observations, we assume that what we see is “normal.”</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, in the case of Florida springs, historical observations from naturalists and area residents give scientists clues going back centuries.</p>\n\n<p>When Bartram visited <a href=\"https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ruth-b-kirby-gilchrist-blue-springs-state-park\">Manatee Springs</a> near Chiefland and the Suwannee River in the Big Bend in 1774, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/63678/63678-h/63678-h.htm#chap12\">he wrote that the spring’s flow was “astonishing</a>” and that “it is impossible to keep the boat or any other floating vessel over the fountain.” </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, senior citizens who grew up in north central Florida in the early 20th century <a href=\"https://dl.bookfunnel.com/ht74pjc4zf\">told writer P.C. Zick</a> that spring flow at <a href=\"https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ichetucknee-springs-state-park\">Ichetucknee Springs</a> was once so strong that they could hear the spring boil before getting close enough to see it.</p>\n\n<p>Both springs’ boils are noticeable today, but they are clearly not what they used to be.</p>\n\n<p>When naturalist <a href=\"https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/103785#page/1/mode/1up\">John James Audubon</a> visited <a href=\"https://floridasprings.org/outstanding-florida-springs-deleon-spring/\">Volusia County’s De Leon Springs</a> in 1832, he found that “The water was quite transparent, although of dark color.” And Bartram wrote of Salt Springs that the water was so clear, he thought he could reach out and touch fish that were 20 to 30 feet below the surface.</p>\n\n<p>Water clarity in thriving springs fosters plenty of submerged grasses soaking up sunshine, along with a wide variety and large number of fish and other aquatic animals that depend on this vegetation. <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/63678/63678-h/63678-h.htm#chap04\">Bartram wrote that he spotted</a> gar, trout, bream, “the barbed catfish, dreaded sting-ray, skate and flounder, spotted bass, sheeps head and ominous drum” at Salt Springs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a

Various springs suffer from one or more of these problems.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, as Florida’s population and tourism have grown, so have the number of visitors to the state’s most popular springs. In 2019, Florida springs <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2020/09/FRE_SpringsFactsheet.Print_.pdf\">attracted more than 4 million visitors</a>. During the summer, especially on weekends, some springs are so crowded that staff members have to turn away visitors. And in winter, springs that attract manatees can be equally crowded.</p>\n\n<p>In shallow portions of springs and <a href=\"https://www.sjrwmd.com/waterways/springs/characteristics/\">spring runs</a>, this means thousands of happy feet trample and destroy vegetation.

Algae naturally occurs in most springs, but today, many springs have so much that it <a href=\"https://sjrr.domains.unf.edu/2-5-turbidity/\">clouds the water</a>, or they have stringy <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/filamentous-algae\">filamentous algae</a> that blankets the soil and rocks around a spring and along its run. Still others have algae that sticks to submerged aquatic plants, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/untreated-sewage-and-fertilizer-runoff-threaten-the-florida-manatees-main-food-source-contributing-to-malnutrition-236461\">blocking vital sunlight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The predominant narrative among many springs scientists, advocates and government officials is that <a href=\"https://www.mysuwanneeriver.com/419/Nitrate-Concentration\">rising nitrate levels</a> in springs over the past few decades fuels the growth of excess algae. Nitrate, a form of nitrogen, is a plant nutrient.</p>\n\n<p>Yet other scientists have suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082571\">reduced spring discharge creates slower-moving water</a>, which loses its ability to push excess algae away. </p>\n\n<p>Another hypothesis is that if dissolved oxygen levels temporarily fall below a certain threshold, it can kill off the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12403\">snails and other animals that graze on the algae</a> and keep it in check.</p>\n\n<h2>A balanced restoration plan</h2>\n\n<p>More than two-thirds of state-funded springs restoration projects over the past decade have been for <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813079158\">some form of enhanced sewage treatment</a>. This is because excess nitrogen is assumed to be the cause of excess algae in Florida springs, and Florida farmers are presumed to be in compliance with water quality regulations <a href=\"https://www.fdacs.gov/Agriculture-Industry/Best-Management-Practices-BMPs/Agricultural-Water-Policy-FAQ\">if they implement best management practices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Enhanced sewage treatment is a good thing, especially in cases where human waste is clearly a pressing problem. In some cases, investing in advanced sewage treatment, shifting landowners from <a href=\"https://www.hernandosun.com/2022/09/03/septic-to-sewer-grants-and-msbu-funding-mechanism-approved/\">septic systems to sewage treatment plants</a> or even enhanced <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/three-sisters-springs-wetland-treatment-project\">treatment of storm water</a> before it sinks into the ground clearly benefits springs.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.hernandocounty.us/departments/departments-n-z/utilities/septic-to-sewer-project\">shifting people from septic tanks to central sewage treatment is expensive</a>. Based on the evidence and my own observations of various springs within Florida’s landscape, I believe that many springs need more than this single solution.</p>\n\n<p>Some need <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/three-sisters-springs-canal-stabilization-project\">shoreline stabilization to prevent erosion</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hernandocounty.us/departments/departments-n-z/parks-and-recreation/waterways-aquatic-services/spring-protection-zone\">rules that reduce human pressure</a> on spring vegetation. Others need <a href=\"https://floridaspecifier.com/issues/v46n5/a-model-of-resilient-restoration-the-kings-bay-restoration-project/#:%7E:text=Remove%20Muck:%20Decades%20of%20accumulated,than%20500%2C000%20native%20eelgrass%20units\">algae or sediment removed</a> and native vegetation reintroduced.</p>\n\n<p>In still other cases, <a href=\"https://www.alachuaconservationtrust.org/act-acquires-santa-fe-springs\">it would help to purchase property to prevent harmful development or to retire farmland</a>. And in nearly every case, the springs would benefit from Florida residents and businesses <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/swamp-for-the-springs-take-action/\">reducing water and fertilizer use</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And, restoring and maintaining the health of Florida’s 1,100 springs will require further study to tailor appropriate interventions to each one.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263704/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher F.

Edgar Hoover had <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/church-committee.htm\">abused his power</a> to persecute people and organizations he <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-targeting-of-enemies-like-james-comey-echoes-fbis-dark-history-of-mass-surveillance-dirty-tricks-and-perversion-of-justice-under-j-edgar-hoover-265364\">viewed as political enemies</a> – destroyed what formerly had been near-automatic trust in the presidency and the FBI.</p>\n\n<p>In response, Congress enacted reforms designed to ensure that legal actions by the Department of Justice and the FBI, the department’s main investigative arm, would be insulated from politics. These included stronger congressional oversight, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/03/fbi-director-10-years-trump-wray/\">10-year term limit for FBI directors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation-9781440871603/\">investigative guidelines</a> issued by the attorney general. </p>\n\n<p>Some of these measures, however, were tenuous. For example, Justice Department leaders could alter FBI investigative guidelines at any time. </p>\n\n<p>Donald Trump’s first presidential term <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/comey-isnt-the-first-fbi-director-to-keep-memos-on-a-president-77899\">seriously tested</a> DOJ and FBI independence – notably, when Trump <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/j-edgar-hoovers-oversteps-why-fbi-directors-are-forbidden-from-getting-cozy-with-presidents-78896\">fired FBI Director James Comey</a> in May 2017. Trump claimed Comey <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527663050/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">mishandled a 2016 probe</a> into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s private email server, but Comey also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531927032/comey-trump-asked-for-loyalty-wanted-him-to-let-flynn-investigation-go\">refused to pledge loyalty</a> to the president.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in Trump’s second term, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/28/trump-executive-power-courts-00201120\">prior guardrails have vanished</a>. The president has installed loyalists at the DOJ and FBI who are dedicated to implementing his political interests.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uo7pnK3N3hU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A lawsuit filed by three former FBI officials fired by the Trump administration asserts that the bureau is being politicized and is supporting Trump’s agenda.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ek4r01QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a historian of the FBI</a>, I recognize the FBI has had only one other overtly political director in the past 50 years: L. Patrick Gray, who served for a year under President Richard Nixon. Gray was held accountable after he tried to help Nixon end the FBI’s Watergate investigation. Whether Trump’s current director, Kash Patel, has more staying power is unclear.</p>\n\n<h2>After Hoover</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since Hoover’s death in 1972, presidents have typically nominated independent candidates with bipartisan support and <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors\">law enforcement roots</a> \nto run the FBI. Most nominees have been judges, senior prosecutors or former FBI or Justice Department officials. </p>\n\n<p>While Hoover publicly proclaimed his FBI independent of politics, he sometimes did the bidding of presidents, including Nixon. Still, Nixon felt that Hoover <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/us/tape-shows-nixon-feared-hoover.html\">had not been compliant enough</a>, so in 1972 he selected Gray, a longtime friend and assistant attorney general, to be Hoover’s successor. </p>\n\n<p>Gray took steps to move the bureau out of Hoover’s shadow. He relaxed strict dress codes for agents, recruited female agents and pointedly hired people from outside the agency – who were not indoctrinated in the Hoover culture  – for administrative posts.</p>\n\n<p>Gray asserted his authority with blunt force. FBI agents at field offices and at headquarters who resisted Gray’s power were censured, fired or transferred. Other senior officials <a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">opted to leave</a>, including the bureau’s top fraud expert, cryptanalyst and skyjacking expert, and the head of its Crime Information Center. </p>\n\n<p>Agents regarded these moves as a purge, and press reports claimed that bureau <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/03/archives/gray-reshuffles-9-on-f-bis-staff-8-had-long-service-in-the-crime.html\">morale was at an all-time low</a>, charges that Gray denied. According to <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9781586483777/G-Mans-Life-FBI-Being-Deep-1586483773/plp\">FBI Associate Director Mark Felt</a>, who became Gray’s second in command, 10 of 16 top FBI officials chose to retire, most of them <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/fbi/author/sanford-ungar/first-edition/\">notable Hoover men</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Gray surrounded himself with what journalist Jack Anderson called “<a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">sharp, but inexperienced, modish, young aides</a>.” FBI insiders called these new hires the “Mod Squad,” a reference to the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062589/\">counterculture TV police series</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit answers questions at a microphone.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Attorney L.

He was so rarely spotted at FBI headquarters that bureau insiders dubbed him “<a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">Two-Day Gray</a>.” At the request of Nixon aide John Ehrlichman, Gray told field offices to <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6875672/the-fbi-political-orders/\">help Nixon campaign surrogates</a> by providing local crime information.</p>\n\n<p>Gray cooperated with Nixon to stymie the FBI’s investigation of the 1972 Watergate break-in and the ensuing cover-up. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/06/archives/a-saddened-witness-louis-patrick-gray-3d-a-no-2-man-closer-to-inner.html\">provided raw FBI investigative documents</a> to the White House and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/27/archives/gray-says-he-destroyed-files-from-hunt-given-him-as-he-met-ehrlichn.html\">burned documents</a> from Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt’s White House safe. </p>\n\n<p>When Nixon had CIA Deputy Director <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/04/archives/a-dedicated-deputy-of-the-cia-enlisted-in-1941-hardworking-officer.html\">Vernon Walters</a> ask Gray, in the name of national security, to halt the FBI’s investigation, Felt and other agency insiders demanded that Gray get this order in writing. The White House backed down, but Nixon’s directive had been recorded. That tape became the so-called “<a href=\"https://millercenter.org/smoking-gun\">smoking gun</a>” evidence of a Watergate cover-up.</p>\n\n<p>Felt, in classic Hoover fashion, then leaked information to discredit Gray, <a href=\"https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700623426/\">hoping to replace him</a>. Gray resigned in disgrace. </p>\n\n<p>While Felt never got the top job, he is now remembered as the prized anonymous source “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/washington/19felt.html\">Deep Throat</a>,” who helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/washington-post\">Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate investigation</a>. But it was internal FBI resistance, from Felt and agents at lower levels, that led to Gray’s departure.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jSrc1CLuQA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">After Democratic National Committee headquarters at Washington, D.C.’s Watergate Hotel was  burgled in June 1972, the FBI was charged with investigating the break-in – as Director L. Patrick Gray tried to subvert his own agency’s investigation.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political from the start</h2>\n\n<p>Campaigning in 2024, Donald Trump vowed to “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-compares-political-opponents-vermin-root-alarming-historians/story?id=104847748\">root out</a>” his political opponents from government. Realizing he was a target because of his investigation of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, FBI director Christopher Wray, whom Trump had nominated in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/wray-trump-fbi-director.html\">resigned in December 2024</a> before Trump could fire him. </p>\n\n<p>In Wray’s place Trump nominated loyalist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kash-Patel\">Kash Patel</a>, a lawyer who worked as a low-level federal prosecutor from 2013 to 2016 and then as a deputy national security appointee during Trump’s first term. </p>\n\n<p>Patel publicly <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/kash-patel-tells-members-media-government-after-trumps/story?id=105432592\">supported Trump’s vow to purge enemies</a> and claimed the FBI was part of a “deep state” that was resistant to Trump. Patel <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/kash-patel-tells-members-media-government-after-trumps/story?id=105432592\">promised to help dismantle</a> this disloyal core and to “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ln145l3o\">rebuild public trust</a>” in the FBI.</p>\n\n<p>Even before Patel was confirmed on Feb. 20, 2025, in an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44842\">historically close</a> 51-49 vote, the Justice Department began <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-fbi-firings-immigration-crime-ad7d6b44\">transferring thousands of agents</a> away from national security matters to immigration duty, which was not a traditional FBI focus. </p>\n\n<p>Hours after taking office, Patel shifted 1,500 agents and staff from FBI headquarters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/fbi-agent-transfers-kash-patel-sworn-in/\">to field offices</a>, claiming that he was streamlining operations. </p>\n\n<p>Patel installed outsider <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/kash-patel-privately-agreed-hire-204724031.html\">Dan Bongino</a> as deputy director. Bongino, another Trump loyalist, was a former New York City policeman and Secret Service agent who had become a full-time political commentator. He embraced a conspiracy theory positing the FBI was “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5306990/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director\">irredeemably corrupt</a>” and advocated “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/dan-bongino-fbi.html\">an absolute housecleaning</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In February, New York City Special Agent in Charge James Dennehy told FBI staff “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/fbi-new-york-email-trump.html\">to dig in</a>” and oppose expected and unprecedented political intrusions. He was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-fbi-official-forced-criticizing-trump-pursuit-agents-investigated-rcna194610\">forced out</a> by March. </p>\n\n<p>Patel then used <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/fbi-polygraph-kash-patel.html\">lie-detector tests</a> and carried out a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/politics/kash-patel-fired-fbi-agents.html\">string of high-profile firings</a> of agents who had investigated either Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Some agents who were fired <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/27/nx-s1-5555373/fbi-agents-fired-2020-george-floyd-protest-knee\">had been photographed kneeling</a> during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington, D.C. – an action they said they took to defuse tensions with protesters.</p>\n\n<p>In response, three fired <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fired-fbi-officials-sue-patel-claiming-he-bowed-to-trumps-campaign-of-retribution\">agents are suing Patel</a> for what they call a political retribution campaign. Ex-NFL football player <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/former-bears-cb-charles-peanut-tillman-says-he-quit-fbi-due-to-trump-administrations-policies-230106635.html\">Charles Tillman</a>, who became an FBI agent in 2017, resigned in September 2025 in protest of Trump policies. Once again, there are <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/1fb5c976fb1f1bd2/ff631230-full.pdf\">assertions of a purge</a>.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1965856884419866735&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Will Patel be held accountable?</h2>\n\n<p>Patel’s actions as director so far illustrate that he is willing to use his position to implement the president’s political designs. When Gray tried to do this in the 1970s, accountability still held force, and Gray left office <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/washington/09gray.html\">in disgrace</a>. Gray participated in a cover-up of illegal behavior that became the subject of an impeachment proceeding. What Patel has done to date, at least what we know about, is not the equivalent – so far. </p>\n\n<p>Today, Patel’s tenure rests solely upon pleasing the president. If formal accountability – a key element of a democracy – is to survive, it will have to come from Congress, whose Republican majority has so far not exercised its power to hold Trump or his administration accountable. Short of that, perhaps internal resistance within the administration or pressure from the public and the media might serve the oversight function that Congress, over the past eight months, has abrogated.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265637/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Douglas M.

No doubt drawing optimism from <a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1569&amp;context=lawreview\">having weathered severe crises</a> before, the Cuban government seems committed to a state of defiance.</p>\n\n<p>But the evidence this time around suggests Havana’s leaders should be less sanguine.</p>\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-partially-rolls-back-internet-rate-hike-anger-grows-2025-06-03/\">increasing costs</a>, Cubans enjoy widespread access to the internet and they <a href=\"https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-09-28-u1-e209363-s27061-nid311893-encuesta-cibercuba-abrumadora-mayoria-cubanos-desea#google_vignette\">know</a> just how bad and how inequitable things are. </p>\n\n<p>For all the government’s rhetoric and commitment to a decades-old revolution, Cubans see a much-vaunted <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/crisis-situation-cuba\">medical system that is failing</a>, unable to provide drugs, procedures — or even electricity.

And with the U.S. now pursuing a policy of maximum pressure against noncompliant governments in Latin America, Havana can rest assured that it will see little breathing room from its powerful neighbor and long-time antagonist.  </p>\n\n<p>That leaves the Cuban government with only a few options.</p>\n\n<p>It could choose to continue <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-06-03/cuban-government-dollarizes-the-internet-this-measure-is-true-digital-apartheid.html\">trying to restrict</a> its citizens’ access to the internet. Unfortunately for the state, the <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-06-03/cuban-government-dollarizes-the-internet-this-measure-is-true-digital-apartheid.html\">internet</a> is the lifeblood of the private sector. </p>\n\n<p>Cuba’s leaders could also choose to rely on the loyalty of its security forces and their ability to intimidate and abuse their fellow Cubans. That has <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cuba-crackdown-harsh-sentences-protesters-220844308.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">worked in the past</a>, but given Havana’s scarce resources and its limited capacity to reward its henchmen, it is not clear that the government can afford to adopt this approach indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, Cuba’s leaders could take steps toward further reform the private sector and eliminate the waste and corruption that have increasingly defined the Cuban state.</p>\n\n<p>Such a course would require the government to permit all Cubans, not just a well-connected few, to compete with state enterprises. It would also mean allowing for a greater degree of foreign investment, which <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121914/how-invest-cuba.asp\">has remained stunted</a> due to government policy. </p>\n\n<p>If the past offers any guide, however, Havana will instead continue to rely on its <a href=\"https://raceandequality.org/resources/cuba-warning-about-the-escalation-of-repression-against-activists-and-human-rights-defenders-four-years-after-the-11j-protests/\">formidable security</a> apparatus to repress is citizens, while privatizing in ways that do not threaten the power and privileges of the elite.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266203/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joseph J.
