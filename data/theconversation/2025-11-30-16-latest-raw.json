The rationale is clear: The tiny, remote island in the Pacific features nearly 1,000 enormous statues – <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Statues-that-Walked/Terry-Hunt/9781439154342\">the moai</a>. The magnitude and number of these monuments defy easy explanation. </p>\n\n<p>Since European ships first encountered these stone giants in the 18th century, outsiders have branded the island as fundamentally mysterious, possibly beyond archaeologists’ ability to explain. This characteristic is part of what makes the island famous. Tour operators market the inexplicable. Documentaries promise unsolved puzzles. Popular books ask how “primitive people” <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/Aku-Aku-the-secret-of-Easter-Island/oclc/645749491\">could possibly move 70-ton megaliths</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Archaeological researchers have put forward various explanations for the statues, which were made between 1200 and 1700, but there remains no consensus. For decades, experts offered plausible scenarios: <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/29564864\">powerful chiefs</a> commanding workers, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/32163979\">elite-controlled</a> statue quarries, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/318941165\">wooden sleds</a> drawn by hundreds of islanders, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/346708\">roller systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eisp.org/category/archaeology/transport/\">wooden rails</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2011.579483\">ceremonial pathway markers</a>. Based on authoritative assertions and compelling narratives, these accounts are rarely connected to archaeological evidence.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=j9V8kzYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">an archaeologist</a> who has been studying Rapa Nui for more than two decades. In newly published research, my colleagues and I believe we’ve solved the mystery in three essential ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, using 11,686 photographs taken by drone, we created a comprehensive, <a href=\"https://arcg.is/qu59O1\">three-dimensional model of Rano Raraku</a>, the <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/32163979\">volcanic crater</a> where 95% of Rapa Nui’s moai were carved. It was a <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">systematic documentation</a> – every slope, every carved surface, every production feature captured at a resolution down to the centimeter. The model generated predictions that we and other researchers could test: If production had been centralized, workshops would have been clustered; if they’d been hierarchical, we’d find differences in resources used at each level; if it had been dictated by elites, techniques would be standardized.</p>\n\n<p>Our data <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">revealed the opposite</a>: Drone imagery shows 30 independent workshops working simultaneously. Instead of top-down organization, small, clan-level groups seem to have used innovative human engineering.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a stone hillside with multiple carvings with colored line annotations\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A close-up of a 3D model of the volcanic crater where nearly all of Rapa Nui’s giant statues were carved, with unfinished carvings outlined.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">Lipo et al., 2025, PLOS One</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Previous attempts to understand Rano Raraku failed not because the quarry held impenetrable secrets but due to the lack of published documentation and the limitations of traditional mapping methods. <a href=\"https://www.bibliotecanacionaldigital.gob.cl/bnd/631/w3-article-651549.html\">Two-dimensional maps</a> couldn’t capture three-dimensional relationships. Statues emerge from cliff faces <a href=\"https://arcg.is/1f9Gf85\">at various angles</a>. Production areas <a href=\"https://arcg.is/WiWrm\">overlap vertically</a>. Carving sequences intersect across time. Traditional archaeological methods provided impressions but missed details and couldn’t capture the system as a whole.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arcg.is/qu59O1\">Our 3D model</a> changes that. We identified 426 moai in various stages of production, 341 extraction trenches, 133 voids where completed statues were removed, and previously unmapped quarrying areas on the exterior slopes. Each workshop was self-contained, demonstrating decentralization. Three distinct carving techniques emerge, showing that different groups employed different approaches while producing standardized forms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"figures carved into a rock formation\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Unfinished moai remain partially carved in a volcanic crater.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">Lipo et al., 2025, PLOS One</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The walking moai</h2>\n\n<p>Second, we generated data to resolve the age-old question about moai transport: How did Rapanui people move these megalithic giants? Despite many decades of attempts, previous transport theories all shared a fatal flaw: They <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">made no predictions</a> that were testable, meaning that scientists could prove or disprove.</p>\n\n<p>Our walking hypothesis – based on oral traditions, ideas by our colleague <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sergio-Haoa\">Sergio Rapu Haoa</a> and tested by Czech engineer <a href=\"https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Pavel_Pavel\">Pavel Pavel</a> – made specific, testable predictions. We found that “road moai,” those statues that were abandoned along constructed roads used for transport, differ morphologically from those that reached their final destinations, large platforms called ahu. </p>\n\n<p>We measured 62 moai abandoned along ancient roads. The road moai proved distinct, characterized by wider bases, D-shaped cross sections and a forward lean of 5-15 degrees. These features wouldn’t be necessary if the moai were transported in a horizontal position. They <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">make vertical transport</a> – “walking” the statues – possible.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.09.029\">built a 4.35-ton concrete replica</a> scaled from road moai. It wasn’t an artistic interpretation but a precise reproduction of measurable features from a statue found along the road and abandoned during transport. With 18 people and three ropes, the statue walked 100 meters in 40 minutes. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHTkcbavhv0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In previous work, the author and colleagues built a replica moai to demonstrate the walking transport.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In recently published work, we documented that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">physics confirmed</a> what walking the replica demonstrated about the road moai shape. The forward lean creates an inverted pendulum that converts lateral oscillation into forward progress. </p>\n\n<p>Those moai that reached ahu must have been altered in order for them to stand upright stably, while those along the roads would retain the features that enabled them to be “walked.”</p>\n\n<p>The distribution data for moai across the landscape provided another test: The locations of road moai leading from the quarry follow an exponential decay curve, meaning that probability of a moai falling in transport is highest near the quarry and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">decreases with distance</a> since those that fall over never get any farther. Fracture patterns on those road moai with breaks align with vertical impact stresses, meaning the broken moai were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">damaged by falling from a standing position</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our testable predictions held. </p>\n\n<h2>Deforestation without collapse</h2>\n\n<p>The third “mystery” is how an advanced society could destroy its own environment. The island was <a href=\"https://www.americanscientist.org/article/rethinking-the-fall-of-easter-island\">deforested by the end of the 17th century</a>. This mystery also yielded to systematic analysis. We analyzed data from previous archaeological excavations. Rather than finding increased rat consumption by people, indicating dietary stress from a lack of other food sources, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">remains of rats eaten by people decreased over time</a> while seafood dominated throughout.</p>\n\n<p>Ecological modeling revealed what we think really happened. Polynesian rats, introduced with the arrival of the first Polynesian colonists around 1200, could grow into a population of millions within just a few years. By eating 95% of the island’s tree seeds, rats <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">prevented forest regeneration</a>. Humans cleared land for cultivation, but rats made the recovery of the palm forests impossible. The synergistic interaction seems to have accelerated deforestation within five centuries.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t “ecocide” – intentional self-destruction – but rather unintended ecological transformation caused by an introduced species. Our research also demonstrated that the Rapanui adapted <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rocks-on-rapa-nui-tell-the-story-of-a-small-resilient-population-countering-the-notion-of-a-doomed-overpopulated-island-232935\">through the use of rock mulch agriculture</a>, which improved soil productivity. They continued to eat seafood and produce monuments for 500 years after deforestation began.</p>\n\n<p>To tackle Rapa Nui’s mysteries, we used systematic documentation. We specified testable predictions, gathered data that could prove us wrong and accepted what the evidence showed. Rapa Nui shows that even entrenched mysteries yield to methodical investigation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270023/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carl Lipo receives funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society.</span></em></p>",

And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. government estimates that <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics\">more than 47 million people</a> in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=58388\">hundreds of billions of dollars</a> a year on programs to help them.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-food/food-safety/food-loss-and-waste/food-waste-faqs\">as much as 40% of it</a> – rots before being eaten. That amount is <a href=\"https://refed.org/food-waste/the-problem/#overview\">equivalent to 120 billion meals a year</a>: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year. </p>\n\n<p>This colossal waste has <a href=\"https://divertinc.com/the-cost-of-wasted-food\">enormous economic costs</a> and renders useless all the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/land-research/farm-kitchen-environmental-impacts-us-food-waste\">water and resources used to grow the food</a>.

Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262551700/titans-of-industrial-agriculture/\">did not protect small farms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/business/china-soybeans-trump-tariffs.html\">severed U.S. soybean trade</a> with China for months.

Mass <a href=\"https://www.food-safety.com/articles/10878-federal-workforce-data-reveal-impact-of-trump-admin-rifs-on-usda-food-safety-expertise\">firings of food safety personnel</a> risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda\">tainted imports</a>, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/51381466/nearly-35000-turkeys-killed-off-at-central-utah-facility-as-bird-flu-returns\">nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/10/usda-cancels-local-food-purchasing-for-schools-food-banks-00222796\">helped schools and food banks buy food</a> from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were <a href=\"https://www.ourweekly.com/2025/11/19/facing-fire-and-funding-cuts/\">unable to count on a key revenue source</a> to keep their farms afloat.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/health/food-poisoning-hurricane-wellness\">food-storage refrigeration</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/nyregion/nyc-food-banks-cuts.html\">derailing communities’ ability</a> to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/social-policy/explainer-understanding-snap-program-and-what-cuts\">benefit substantially</a> from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer/training/notice/equal-treatment-rule\">SNAP customers must pay the same prices</a> as other customers.</p>\n\n<p>Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.</p>\n\n<p><em>American University School of International Service master’s student <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurel-levin-932316b5/\">Laurel Levin</a> contributed to the writing of this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270027/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Garrett Graddy-Lovelace received funding from the NSF Multiscale RECIPES for Sustainable Food Systems project.</span></em></p>",

In fact, the shaky agreement is a testament that without diplomacy and a long-term stabilizing accord, military power alone will not suffice.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s in a ceasefire</h2>\n\n<p>The ceasefire ostensibly brought an end to the latest war between Israel and Hezbollah. After entering the conflict that followed Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hezbollah saw its leadership and military capabilities debilitated by Israel, setting off a ripple effect that has helped reshape the Middle East. </p>\n\n<p>Just as an empowered Hezbollah managed for decades to <a href=\"https://newlinesinstitute.org/nonstate-actors/hezbollahs-ascendance-regional-influence-global-networks-and-implications-for-middle-east-stability/\">influence Middle East politics</a>, its sudden loss of strength had a similar effect in reverse – contributing to regime change in Syria and Israel’s war on Iran in June. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A protester holds a flag in front of burning tires.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A retired member of the Lebanese security forces holds a national flag and flashes a victory sign next to burning tires blocking a road leading to the government palace during a protest in Beirut on Sept. 17, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Lebanon/8ac00bf87f7041d3ac4d7bf477157e53/photo\">AP Photo/Bilal Hussein</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The November 2024 <a href=\"https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1437074/full-text-of-the-cease-fire-agreement-between-lebanon-and-israel.html\">ceasefire agreement</a> stipulated that, along with the cessation of fighting, Lebanon would remove all nonstate military forces and assets, starting in the south, between the Litani River and the border with Israel.

It was the <a href=\"https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Yusri-Hazran.pdf\">first Lebanese government since 2008</a> in which Hezbollah did not possess veto power over its actions. </p>\n\n<p>Many in Lebanon saw this as a <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/seizing-lebanons-moment-why-now\">once-in-a-generation opportunity</a> for the state to regain its sovereign capacities, including through the disarmament of Hezbollah. By doing so, it was hoped the country could achieve stability and begin the process of an economic recovery badly needed following its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanons-financial-crisis-how-it-happened-2022-01-23/\">October 2019</a> financial meltdown.</p>\n\n<p>Yet disarming Hezbollah has proved to be extremely challenging. Hezbollah was – and arguably still is – the most powerful military force in Lebanon. Its military might had enabled it not only to establish a perceived balance of deterrence with Israel, but to position itself as a critical player in Lebanese politics. Willingly giving up its arms to the Lebanese state would be tantamount to fundamentally transforming its “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2020.1779587\">resistance</a>” identity and relinquishing political power to other Lebanese parties and sectarian forces.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Soldiers with helmets on a patrol.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.N. peacekeepers secure an area in southern Lebanon following the beginning of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon on Nov. 27, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TrumpUNPeacekeepingLebanon/75082f5511ba4fd4914b510da1c4356d/photo\">AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Carrying out the disarmament of Hezbollah in line with the ceasefire is theoretically a job for the Lebanese army. But since its foundation in 1945, the army has mainly operated as a symbol of the country’s sovereignty rather than as practical defender – even in times of acute crises such as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War\">civil war from 1975 to 1990</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The army does not have the military capacity, political clout or will to force Hezbollah to give up its arms. If it tried coercively, it would likely lead to armed resistance that might spiral into a new civil war.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-11-24/ty-article/.premium/lebanon-escalation-serves-netanyahus-interests-and-has-trumps-blessing/0000019a-b28c-d67f-adbe-fecffd680000\">remains unpopular</a>. He was roundly accused of prolonging the war in Gaza to deflect from his own legal problems and his government’s deficiencies. And that remains a distinct possibility when it comes to Lebanon, too. </p>\n\n<p>Resolving existing border disputes between the two countries, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, would be significant. Since 2000, such disputes have been used by Hezbollah as an excuse to continue its armed struggle against Israel. And in general, <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/defining-and-stabilizing-lebanons-borders\">the lack of defined Lebanese borders with both Syria and Israel</a> has been a constant source of conflict. </p>\n\n<p>But so far, any diplomatic efforts have failed to materialize over ongoing <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/lebanese-prime-minister-accuses-israel-of-refusing-to-negotiate-on-border-disputes/\">deep mistrust</a> and, despite the ceasefire, active conflict. </p>\n\n<p>As of now, there are only dim prospects for that to change, absent unlikely U.S. pressure. On the Israeli side, any border agreement that would entail ceding territory to Lebanon is politically untenable, and the current right-wing government is showing little interest in diplomacy. For Lebanon, the weakness of the central government in the face of Hezbollah’s still-significant power, along with Israel’s ongoing military actions, makes practical negotiations exceedingly difficult. </p>\n\n<h2>The same old sordid tune?</h2>\n\n<p>Instead, what appears to be unfolding is a return to the vicious cycle that has characterized Israel-Lebanon relations since the late 1960s: Hezbollah and other nonstate actors in Lebanon respond to Israeli military incursions, only to be met with further Israeli retaliation. That, in turn, further weakens the Lebanese state – yet Lebanese state capacity remains the only way to break the vicious cycle. </p>\n\n<p>The key for calm in Lebanon may be again in the hands of the U.S. administration, with the support of an extended regional coalition, perhaps even by including Iran in the deal. </p>\n\n<p>So far, most American diplomacy in the Lebanon-Israel context has been to pressure Beirut. Avoiding renewed war on the Israel-Lebanon front may require U.S. coercive diplomacy, where the pressure is more equally distributed on each party. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, only a strong and stable Lebanon, where the state is the sole holder of arms and in charge of foreign policy, can move us past the current cycle. Israeli military pressure will not get us far in this direction. It must come mainly through an internal Lebanese political process.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270423/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Asher Kaufman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Understanding what the results of a particular study are and are not saying can help you sift through what you see in the news or on social media. </p>\n\n<p>Let me walk you through the scientific process, from investigation to publication. The research results you hear about crucially depend on the way scientists formulate the questions they’re investigating.</p>\n\n<h2>The scientific method and the null hypothesis</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers in all kinds of fields use the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method\">scientific method</a> to investigate the questions they’re interested in.</p>\n\n<p>First, a scientist formulates a new claim – what’s called a hypothesis. For example, is having some genetic mutations in BRCA genes related to a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet\">higher risk of breast cancer</a>? Then they gather data relevant to the hypothesis and decide, based on the data, whether that initial claim was correct or not.</p>\n\n<p>It’s intuitive to think that this decision is cleanly dichotomous – that the researcher decides the hypothesis is either true or false. But of course, just because you decide something doesn’t mean you’re right.</p>\n\n<p>If the claim is really false but the researcher decides, based on the evidence, it’s true – a false positive – they commit what’s called a <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-categorical-proportions/error-probabilities-power/v/introduction-to-type-i-and-type-ii-errors\">Type 1 error</a>. If the claim is really true but the researcher fails to see that – a false-negative conclusion – then they commit a Type 2 error.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, in the real world, it gets a little messier. It’s really hard to decide about the truth or falsity of a claim just based on what’s observed.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason, most scientists employ what is called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1537891\">null hypothesis significance testing</a> framework. Here’s how it works: A researcher first states a “null hypothesis,” something that’s contrary to what they want to prove. For instance, in our example the null hypothesis is that BRCA genetic mutations are not associated with increased breast cancer occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>The scientist still gathers data and makes a decision, but the decision is not about whether the null is true. Instead, a researcher decides whether there’s enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man in white coat in lab looking at tablet\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Careful statistical analysis along with a well-formulated null hypothesis lend confidence to a study finding.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/researcher-in-lab-coat-stressed-while-studying-dna-royalty-free-image/2229038550\">Jackyenjoyphotography/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What rejecting the null does and doesn’t mean</h2>\n\n<p>Understanding this distinction is crucial. Rejecting the null is equivalent in practice to acting as though it is false – in the example, rejecting the null means claiming that those with some BRCA gene mutations do have a higher risk of breast cancer. Along with other evidence, such as the size of the increased risk, this outcome can justify recommending early breast cancer screening <a href=\"https://www.basser.org/brca/brca-women\">for people with the identified BRCA mutations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But failing to reject the null hypothesis doesn’t imply that it’s true – in this case, it doesn’t mean there is no association between the BRCA mutations and breast cancer. Rather, such a result is inconclusive; there’s not enough evidence to claim there is an association. A negative result – inadequate evidence to say the null is false – does not necessarily invite the researcher to believe the null is true. </p>\n\n<p>This is because null hypothesis significance testing is set up to control for Type 1 error (false positive) at a level defined in advance by the researcher but at the cost of having less control over Type 2 error (false negative).</p>\n\n<p>A researcher’s chances of correctly rejecting the null if there is increased risk can depend on how much data they have, how complex the design of the study is and, most importantly, how large the effect actually is. It’s much easier to reject the null if BRCA mutations truly increase cancer risk many times than it is if the risk is only slightly elevated. A researcher can end up with a result that is not statistically significant but cannot rule out the possibility of an increased risk that is too small for the study to detect.</p>\n\n<h2>Which results are more often publicized</h2>\n\n<p>Once they have their result and the researchers want to disseminate their work, they typically do so through <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-peer-review-the-role-anonymous-experts-play-in-scrutinizing-research-before-it-gets-published-258255\">peer-reviewed publication</a>. Journal publishers consider a researcher’s write-up of their study, send it out for other scientists to review, and then decide whether to publish it.</p>\n\n<p>In this process, the publishers tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2025.2538066\">favor studies that rejected their null hypothesis</a> over those that failed to reject it. This is called positive publication bias.</p>\n\n<p>It is natural for publishers to prefer studies that support new claims since they objectively carry more information than studies that failed to reject their null hypothesis. Journals want to publish something new and noteworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Many sources flag this phenomenon as “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4103/sja.SJA_124_19\">bad science</a>,” but is it really? Remember, the framework used to make decisions about scientific claims is intentionally only capable of either rejecting the null hypothesis – in other words, supporting the claim – or alternatively declaring inconclusive results.</p>\n\n<p>The framework isn’t designed to be able to prove the null hypothesis. That said, researchers can reverse the design of a scientific investigation so that a previous claim becomes the null hypothesis in a new study with fresh data.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, rather than a null hypothesis that there is no association between BRCA mutations and breast cancer, the null hypothesis becomes that the increased breast cancer risk from BRCA mutations is equal to or greater than some value the researcher settles on before gathering fresh data.</p>\n\n<p>Rejecting the null this time would mean the increased risk is smaller than that set value, thus supporting the claim consistent with what had previously been the null hypothesis on prior data. In the example, rejecting the null means the effect of BRCA genes is small enough to be practically negligible in terms of developing breast cancer.</p>\n\n<p>It’s critical for a researcher to structure their study so that what they’re interested in proving is aligned with the rejection of the null. Publishers are naturally less inclined to consider studies that failed to reject their null hypothesis, not because they do not want to publish studies that support negative statements but because null hypothesis significance testing does not actually support negative statements. Failure to reject the null just means your results are inconclusive – and may perhaps seem less newsworthy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"library shelves with research journals\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Research journals want to publish results that will have an impact.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/books-and-magazines-in-a-college-library-royalty-free-image/183260980\">luoman/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What positive publication bias does</h2>\n\n<p>So what does the practice of preferring to publish studies that reject their null hypothesis do?</p>\n\n<p>While we can’t know for certain, we can see how this plays out under different circumstances.

It reverses an opioid overdose nearly instantly, restarting breathing in a person who was unresponsive moments before and on the brink of death. To bystanders witnessing it being administered, naloxone can appear almost supernatural.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Naloxone\">approved naloxone for medical use in 1971</a> and for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-approval-of-over-the-counter-narcan-is-an-important-step-in-the-effort-to-combat-the-us-opioid-crisis-198497\">over-the-counter purchase in 2023</a>, exactly how it works is still unclear. Researchers know naloxone acts on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/your-body-naturally-produces-opioids-without-causing-addiction-or-overdose-studying-how-this-process-works-could-help-reduce-the-side-effects-of-opioid-drugs-204522\">opioid receptors</a>, a family of proteins responsible for the body’s response to pain. When opioids such as morphine <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-fentanyl-and-why-is-it-behind-the-deadly-surge-in-us-drug-overdoses-a-medical-toxicologist-explains-182629\">and fentanyl</a> bind to these receptors, they produce not only pain relief and euphoria but also dangerous side effects. Naloxone competes with opioids for access to these receptors, preventing the drugs from triggering effects in the body. How it does this at the molecular level, however, has been an ongoing question.</p>\n\n<p>In our recently published research in the journal Nature, my team and I were able to provide some definitive evidence of how naloxone works by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">capturing images of it in action</a> for the first time.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CM6kgzRxyc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Knowing how to use naloxone can save lives.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Biology of opioids</h2>\n\n<p>To better grasp how naloxone works, it’s helpful to first zoom in on the biology behind opioids.</p>\n\n<p>One member of the family of opioid receptors, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/oprm1/\">MOR – short for µ-opioid receptor</a> – is a central player in regulating the body’s response to pain. It sits on the surface of neurons, mostly in the brain and spinal cord, and acts as a communication hub.</p>\n\n<p>When an opioid – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.120.119388\">such as an endorphin</a>, the body’s natural painkillers – interacts with MOR, it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2420623122\">changes the structure of the receptor</a>. This change in shape allows what’s called a G protein to bind to the receptor and trigger a signal to the rest of the body to reduce pain, induce pleasure, or – in the case of overdose – dangerously slow breathing and heart rate. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of different configurations of MOR\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When a molecule binds to the µ-opioid receptor, it changes its structure and elicits an effect.

The G protein is the mechanism inside the lock that turns when the correct key – in this case, an endorphin or a drug like fentanyl – goes in. For decades, scientists believed that an opioid’s ability to enable this signaling cascade was linked to how effectively it reshaped the structure of the receptor – essentially, whether the lock could open wide enough for the internal mechanism of the G-protein to engage.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, recent research – including our work – has revealed that the critical step to how opioids work is not how wide they open the lock but how well the mechanism works. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/qrd.2021.7\">G proteins act like a switch</a>, releasing one molecule in exchange for another molecule that triggers the protein to send the signal that sets off opioid effects.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, drugs like fentanyl, by acting on the receptor, transmit physical changes to G proteins that result in the switch flipping more rapidly. What we now see is that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">naloxone jams the mechanism</a>, preventing the switch from flipping and sending the signal.</p>\n\n<h2>Capturing the switch</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers know that the effects of opioids are triggered when the G protein switch is flipped. But what does this process look like?</p>\n\n<p>For years, attempts to visualize this mechanism were largely limited to two states – before the G protein binds to the µ-opioid receptor, and after the molecule was released from the G protein. The states in between were considered too unstable to isolate. My team and I wanted to capture these unseen states moment by moment as the switch flips and the molecule is released. </p>\n\n<p>To do this, we used a technique called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/visualizing-the-inside-of-cells-at-previously-impossible-resolutions-provides-vivid-insights-into-how-they-work-195873\">cryo-electron microscopy</a>, which freezes molecules in motion to visualize them at near-atomic resolution.

We found that both the opioid receptor and the G protein are inactive at this point. Moreover, naloxone stabilizes this latent state.

Plimpton was a leading member of a mid-20th-century class of literary journalists, including <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/how-tom-wolfe-became-tom-wolfe?srsltid=AfmBOopRl4QgQQV2u_eKu7oLjx17RGPShfD03XDFCmm_I4zNMU1gNjj_\">Tom Wolfe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Capote/Gerald-Clarke/9781439187500\">Truman Capote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/talese/American%20Writers.pdf\">Gay Talese</a> and <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1280772368\">Norman Mailer</a>, who were becoming known for applying novelistic techniques and sometimes personal, subjective perspectives to nonfiction. </p>\n\n<p>While the other literati tackled heavy topics, Plimpton’s engaging, conversational prose goofed around on the fringes of pro sports. Many of his books followed the same “participatory journalism” formula. He wrote about <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/948589220\">pitching against MLB all-stars</a>, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/926062045\">traveling with the PGA tour</a>, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/926061810\">boxing a bout against Archie Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/926062025\">playing with the Boston Bruins</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those were just the full-length books. Other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/27/arts/george-plimpton-author-and-editor-is-dead-at-76.html\">television and magazine projects</a> had Plimpton competing in tennis and bridge; performing stand-up comedy; acting in a Western; playing with the New York Philharmonic; and attempting to be an aerialist with the circus.</p>\n\n<p>However, he is best known for trying his hand quarterbacking for the Lions. </p>\n\n<h2>Posh writer meets the gridiron</h2>\n\n<p>In some ways, Plimpton seemed exactly the wrong person for this job. The possessor of a distinctively old money accent and patrician wealth and manners, he was <a href=\"https://www.themorgan.org/research/paris-review\">founding editor of The Paris Review</a> and in 1967 a mainstay of literary salons in Paris and New York. “Author, critic, interviewer, party-giver … friend of everybody, gifted, personable, energetic, bright, with-it, rich, a legend in his own time,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1967/01/08/archives/george-plimpton-is-different-from-you-and-me.html\">The New York Times gushed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Just the kind of person whom your average football fan might enjoy seeing knocked flat. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C982%2C5432%2C3055&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"American writer George Plimpton sits and poses for a portrait photo\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C982%2C5432%2C3055&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=752&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=752&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702930/original/file-20251117-56-thbhjl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=752&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">American journalist and literary critic George Plimpton was no fan of pain, and that limited his ability on the football field.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/american-journalist-george-plimpton-pictured-on-august-16th-news-photo/1447745348?adppopup=true\">Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Plimpton joined a team he described as recovering from scandal. After ending the 1962 season with an 11-3 record and a Playoff Bowl victory for third place in the NFL, the NFL commissioner’s office fined six Lions for gambling on the championship game between Green Bay and New York. More significant on field, the commissioner suspended Lions great defensive tackle and future Pro Football Hall of Famer Alex Karras for one year. Without him, the Lions would end the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/index.htm\">1963 season 5-8-1</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton wrote his way onto the team by promising to “just hang around on the periphery of things and not bother anyone, just try to participate enough to get the feel of things.” </p>\n\n<p>Wilson agreed, and Plimpton arrived at training camp a few months later with his own football, purchased from an army-navy store in Times Square, and a “mild fiction” about having played quarterback at Harvard and for the nonexistent Newfoundland Newfs. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton’s attempt at deception might raise ethical questions; however, the joke is always on him. The coaching staff seemed to have thought it would be hilarious if anyone on the team actually took the gangly 36-year-old with the nasal accent as a professional football player. It seems unlikely that anyone did. </p>\n\n<p>“I never had the temerity to pretend I was something that I wasn’t,” Plimpton wrote. “The team caught on quickly enough.”</p>\n\n<p>At camp, Plimpton hung around the dining hall and sat in the back of team meetings. A master of small talk, he lets the reader eavesdrop on conversations with Hall of Famers Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane and Joe Schmidt. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton takes us with him one night to a bar frequented by coaches, where we listen in rounds of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5HycgBnqxk\">liars’ poker</a> with Wilson, Scooter McLean and Les Bingaman. We tag along as he chats with Karras at <a href=\"https://www.vintagedetroit.com/remembering-detroits-original-sports-bar-the-lindell-ac/?srsltid=AfmBOooI-Rz0iLwMNRSBFd_ffghWlfuIv5SxuuLzkozcj0QC7G2r81Ds\">Lindell’s A.C.</a>, the bar the player owned in downtown Detroit at the time.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons in grit</h2>\n\n<p>At training camp, Plimpton faced the teasing of players but earned respect by facing the brutality of sport and by persisting despite the  inevitability of pain. He never played football in school, beyond a beery game between <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/\">Harvard Crimson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.harvardlampoon.com/read\">Harvard Lampoon</a>, and did not know the basics of playing quarterback. </p>\n\n<p>Several days into camp, he was allowed to participate in a play where, as quarterback, he was supposed to quickly hand off the ball to another player. </p>\n\n<p>“At ‘two’ the snap back came,” Plimpton wrote. “I began to turn without the proper grip on the ball, moving too nervously, and I fumbled the ball, gaping at it, mouth ajar, as it fell and bounced twice, once away from me, then back, and rocked back and forth gaily at my feet. I flung myself on it (…) and I heard the sharp strange whack of gear, the grunts, and then a quick sudden weight whooshed the air out of me.” </p>\n\n<p>The same thing happened when Plimpton was allowed to take the field in an annual intra-squad game played in Pontiac. Over his first three plays he lost 20 yards by falling down, getting knocked over by his own teammates and being literally picked from the ground by a zealous defender. On the bus ride home, Plimpton admitted to Wilson that he didn’t like being hit. </p>\n\n<p>The coach gently explained that “love of physical contact” was necessary to make it in pro football.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When kids, out in a park, chose of sides for tackle rather than touch, the guys that want to be ends and go out for the passes, or even quarterback, because they think subconsciously they can get rid of the ball before being hit, those guys don’t end up as football players,” Wilson mused. “They become great tennis players, or skiers, or high jumpers. It doesn’t mean they lack courage or competitiveness.” </p>\n\n<p>“But the guys who put up their hands to be tackles or guards, or fullbacks who run not for daylight but for trouble – those are the ones who will make it as football players.” </p>\n\n<p>This quality of great football players – an irrational enthusiasm for bruising physical contact – is celebrated by Plimpton in the veteran Lions who take him into their orbit. He becomes friends with Karras and offensive lineman John Gordy, in particular, and shoots the breeze on topics ranging from the NFL commissioner to Adolf Hitler. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/george-plimpton/mad-ducks-and-bears/9780316326445/?lens=little-brown\">a subsequent book</a>, Plimpton goes with the pair to a madcap golf tournament and starts a ridiculous business venture, suggesting the on-field madness necessary to succeed in football bleeds into off-field life as well. </p>\n\n<p>But it is not Plimpton’s way to delve into the psychology of his idols. Rather, he listens as they spin tales that show how reckless the grown men who run toward trouble really are.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267946/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephen Siff does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Mark Kelly</a>, a Democrat, who is a retired Navy captain, decorated combat veteran and former NASA astronaut.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly and five other members of Congress with military or intelligence backgrounds told members of the armed forces “You can refuse illegal orders” in a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/just-follow-orders-or-obey-the-law-what-us-troops-told-us-about-refusing-illegal-commands-270401\">video released on Nov. 18</a>, reiterating oaths that members of the military and the intelligence community swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. The legislators said they acted in response to concerns expressed by troops currently serving on active duty.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump called the video “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-democrats-death-penalty-sedition-military-orders-rcna245003\">seditious behavior, punishable by death</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Retired senior officers like Kelly can be recalled to duty at any time, which would make it possible for the Pentagon to put Kelly on trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, although the Defense Department announcement did not specify possible charges. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1993008532187148582\">wrote online</a> that “Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”</p>\n\n<p>This threat to punish Kelly is just the latest move by the Trump administration against perceived enemies at home. By branding critics and opponents as disloyal, traitorous or worse, Trump and his supporters are resurrecting a playbook that hearkens back to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40971992.pdf\">Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s crusade</a> against people he portrayed as domestic threats to the U.S. in the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p>As a historian who studies <a href=\"https://artsci.tamu.edu/history/contact/profiles/gregory-a-daddis.html\">national security and the Cold War era</a>, I know that McCarthyism wrought <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/2552/culture-cold-war\">devastating social and cultural harm</a> across our nation. In my view, repeating what I believe constitutes social and political fratricide could be just as harmful today, perhaps even more so.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DRc5XTOCdD_&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Targeting homegrown enemies</h2>\n\n<p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, many Americans believed the United States was a nation under siege. Despite their victory in World War II, Americans <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/faith-and-fear-9780197804223?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">saw a dangerous world confronting them</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The communist-run Soviet Union held Eastern Europe in an iron grip. In 1949, Mao Zedong’s communist troops triumphed in the bloody <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Chinese-Civil-War\">Chinese civil war</a>. One year later, the Korean peninsula descended into full-scale conflict, raising the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/korea-and-fear-world-war-iii#\">World War III</a> – a frightening possibility in the atomic era.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-communist zealots in the U.S., most notably Wisconsin Republican Sen. McCarthy, argued that treasonous Americans were weakening the nation at home. During a February 1950 speech in <a href=\"https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/McCarthy_Wheeling_Speech.pdf\">Wheeling, West Virginia</a>, McCarthy asserted that “the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this nation” were undermining the United States during its “final, all-out battle” against communism.</p>\n\n<p>When communist forces toppled China’s government, critics such as political activist <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/utley-freda-1898-1977\">Freda Utley</a> lambasted President Harry Truman’s administration for what they cast as its timidity, blundering and, worse, “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/chinastory011649mbp/mode/2up?q=treason\">treason in high places</a>.” Conflating foreign and domestic threats, McCarthy claimed without evidence that homegrown enemies “within our borders have been <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/josephrmccarthy00matu/page/46/mode/2up?q=%22within+our+borders+have+been+more+responsible%22\">more responsible for the success of communism abroad</a> than Soviet Russia.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/97reHqY6oPo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">From 1950 through 1954, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican, used his role as chair of two powerful Senate committees to identify and accuse people he thought were Communist sympathizers. Many of those accused lost their jobs even when there was little or no evidence to support the accusations.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As ostensible proof, the senator pointed to American lives being lost in Korea and argued that it was possible to “fully fight a war abroad and at the same time … dispose of the traitorous filth and the Red vermin which have accumulated at home.”</p>\n\n<p>Political opponents might <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpwashingtonpost/docview/152427336/EE18A76FF0074046PQ/4?accountid=13758&amp;sourcetype=Newspapers\">disparage McCarthy</a> for his “dishonest and cowardly use of fractional fact and innuendo,” but the Wisconsinite knew how to play to the press. Time and again, McCarthy would bombastically lash out against his critics as he did with columnist <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Columnist.html?id=b-MmEAAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description\">Drew Pearson</a>, calling him “an unprincipled liar,” “a fake” and the owner of a “twisted perverted mentality.”</p>\n\n<p>While McCarthy focused on allegedly disloyal government officials and media journalists, other self-pronounced protectors of the nation sought to warn naive members of the public. Defense Department pamphlets like “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Know_Your_Communist_Enemy/Pode7xN4d8YC\">Know Your Communist Enemy</a>” alerted Americans against being duped by Communist Party  members skilled in deception and manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>Virulent anti-communists denounced what they viewed as inherent weaknesses of postwar American society, with a clearly political bent. Republicans asserted that cowardly, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo193960577.html\">effeminate liberals</a> were weakening the nation’s defense by minimizing threats both home and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQDO3nEkX8F&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Censure and worse</h2>\n\n<p>In such an anxiety-ridden environment, “<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?vid=9780811828871&amp;hl=en\">red-baiting</a>” – discrediting political opponents by linking them to communism – spread across the country, leaving a trail of wrecked lives. From teachers to public officials, anyone deemed un-American by McCarthyites faced public censure, loss of employment or even imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Under the 1940 <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/cold-war-political-justice-9780837196923/\">Smith Act</a>, which criminalized promoting the overthrow of the U.S. government, hundreds of Americans were prosecuted during the Cold War simply for having been members of the Communist Party of the United States. The act also authorized the “deportation of aliens,” reflecting fears that communist ideas had seeped into nearly all facets of American society.</p>\n\n<p>The 1950 <a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/64/STATUTE-64-Pg987.pdf\">Internal Security Act</a>, widely known as the McCarran Act, further emphasized existential threats from within. “Disloyal aliens,” a term the law left purposefully vague, could have their citizenship revoked. Communist Party members were required to register with the government, a step that made them susceptible to prosecution under the Smith Act.</p>\n\n<p>Immigrants could be detained or deported if the president declared an “internal security emergency.” Advocates called this policy “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1119245.pdf\">preventive detention</a>,” while critics derided the act as a “<a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/the-rise-and-fall-of-america-s-concentration-camp-law-1\">Concentration Camp Law</a>,” in the words of historian Masumi Izumi.</p>\n\n<h2>Scapegoating outsiders</h2>\n\n<p>The scaremongering wasn’t just about people’s political views: Vulnerable groups, such as gay people, were also targeted. McCarthy warned of links between “<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691048703/many-are-the-crimes\">communists and queers</a>,” asserting that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/16/archives/federal-vigilance-on-perverts-asked-senate-group-says-they-must-be.html\">sexual perverts</a>” had infested the U.S. government, especially the State Department, and posed “dangerous security risks.” Closeted gay or lesbian employees, the argument went, were vulnerable to blackmail by foreign governments.</p>\n\n<p>Fearmongering also took on a decidedly racist tone. South Carolina Governor <a href=\"https://medium.com/history-uncut/the-cold-war-comes-home-39a7978a5907\">George Bell Timmerman, Jr.</a>, for instance, argued in 1957 that enforcing “Negro voting rights” would promote the “cause of communism.” </p>\n\n<p>Three years later, a comic book titled <a href=\"https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/communism/The%20Red%20Iceberg/\">“The Red Iceberg</a>” insinuated that communists were exploiting the “tragic plight” of Black families and that the <a href=\"https://naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, a leading U.S. civil rights advocacy group, had been infiltrated by the Kremlin. Conservatives like Arizona <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/conservatism/conservatism-civil-rights\">Sen. Barry Goldwater</a> criticized the growing practice of using federal power to enforce civil rights, calling it communist-style social engineering.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YwVxLgWaTY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In an interview on Oct. 13, 2024, then-candidate Donald Trump described Democratic Party rivals as ‘the enemy from within’ and suggested using the armed forces against ‘radical left lunatics’ on Election Day.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A new McCarthyism</h2>\n\n<p>While it’s never simple to draw neat historical parallels from past eras to the present, it appears McCarthy-like actions are recurring widely today. During the Red Scare, the focus was on alleged communists. Today, the focus is on straightforward dissent. Critics, both past and present, of President Donald Trump’s actions and policies are being targeted.</p>\n\n<p>At the national level, Trump has called for using military force against “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-military-enemy-from-within-election-day\">the enemy from within</a>.” On Sept. 30, 2025, Trump told hundreds of generals and admirals who had been <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-directs-generals-defend-us-war/story?id=126087035\">called to Quantico, Virginia</a>, from posts around the world that the National Guard should view America’s “dangerous cities as training grounds.” </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration is making <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-law-from-the-era-of-red-scares-is-supercharging-trump-administrations-power-over-immigrants-and-noncitizens-255307\">expansive use of the McCarran Act</a> to crack down on immigrants in U.S. cities. White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/stephen-miller-says-we-can-suspend-habeas-corpus-because-we-are-being-invaded-own-words-belie\">Stephen Miller</a> has proposed suspending the constitutionally protected <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus\">writ of habeas corpus</a>, which entitles prisoners to challenge their detentions in court, in order to deport “illegal aliens,” alleging that the U.S. is “under invasion.” </p>\n\n<p>In my home state of Texas, political fearmongering has taken on an equally McCarthyesque tone, with the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/21/texas-communism-dangers-schools-fascism\">Legislature directing</a> the State Board of Education to adopt mandatory instruction on “atrocities attributable to communist regimes.” </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that right-wing activist Laura Loomer has unapologetically called for <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/laura-loomer-trump-mccarthyism-rcna226607\">“making McCarthy great again.”</a></p>\n\n<h2>Disagreement is democratic</h2>\n\n<p>The history of McCarthyism shows where this kind of action can lead. Charging political opponents <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-accuses-obama-treason-oval-office/story?id=123963917\">with treason</a> and calling the media an “<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/enemy-of-the-people/\">enemy of the people</a>,” all without evidence, undercuts democratic principles. </p>\n\n<p>These actions cast certain groups as different and dehumanize them. Portraying political rivals as existential threats, simply for disagreeing with their fellow citizens or political leaders, promotes forced consensus. This diminishes debate and can lead to bad policies. </p>\n\n<p>Americans live in an insecure world today, but as I see it, demonizing enemies won’t make the United States a safer place. Instead, it only will lead to the kind of harm that was brought to pass by the very worst tendencies of McCarthyism.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265964/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gregory A.

I relocated from Hawaii, where I had learned the Hawaiian language. </p>\n\n<p>When I arrived in Colorado, I decided I needed to learn about the Indigenous language of the Boulder and Denver area, Arapaho. The <a href=\"https://www.northernarapaho.com/\">Arapaho people</a> had occupied the area for many years until <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/project/arapaho/contemporary-life/history-northern-arapaho-tribe\">they were forced to leave in the 1860s</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I first visited the Northern Arapaho people on <a href=\"https://windriver.org/destinations/wind-river-indian-reservation/\">the Wind River Reservation</a> in Wyoming in 1999. At that time, there were hundreds of speakers of the Arapaho language. </p>\n\n<p>Today, there are less than 100, and all are over the age of 70. </p>\n\n<p>The Arapaho people in Wyoming and Colorado believe their language can still survive, and so do I. That’s why I am working to combine decades of language documentation with new technological approaches in order to help revive the language.</p>\n\n<h2>Loss of Native languages</h2>\n\n<p>Many Native American languages currently have <a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/endangered-languages-of-the-united-states.html\">few Native speakers</a>, and the speakers are typically <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/25/1233819688/the-race-to-save-indigenous-languages\">the oldest members of the community</a>. The languages of the Wichita and Kansa people, for example, are among <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinct_languages_of_North_America\">many that are no longer spoken at all</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Native American <a href=\"https://hir.harvard.edu/the-death-and-revival-of-indigenous-languages/\">languages have been in decline</a> in the face of Euro-American pressure for centuries. </p>\n\n<p>On the Great Plains, this decline <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/478774544/5-American-Indian-languages\">accelerated after World War II</a> when Native soldiers came home after seeing prosperity off the reservation. </p>\n\n<p>Arapaho elders tell me that bilingual parents decided to speak only English to their children to improve their chances of success in life. They were certain the tribal languages would come “later.” </p>\n\n<p>But “later” didn’t happen. Boarding schools had already been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-native-students-fought-back-against-abuse-and-assimilation-at-us-boarding-schools-165222\">suppressing the language</a>, and now economic improvements brought cars, radios and televisions to Wind River, further promoting the use of English. Without language exposure in the home, children were not able to acquire good speaking abilities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOy6KGljBC4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A documentary from Rocky Mountain PBS about Native American people who lost their language as children.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, however, tribal communities around the country increasingly <a href=\"https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/bia_native_american_revitalization_lit_review_draft_08182023.pdf\">want to maintain or reacquire their languages</a>. Efforts to do this have been going on for several decades, with some successes, such as the <a href=\"https://nativesciencereport.org/2018/12/when-you-come-in-this-house-you-speak-mohawk/\">Mohawk language of New York and Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://language.cherokee.org/language-programs/\">Cherokee in Oklahoma and North Carolina</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pieganinstitute.org/\">Blackfoot language of northern Montana</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In most places however, numbers of Native speakers continue to decline, while learning among younger speakers progresses slowly. </p>\n\n<h2>Uses of data for curriculum</h2>\n\n<p>My early work focused on documenting the Arapaho language. Past linguists working with Native languages <a href=\"https://cla.berkeley.edu/\">typically focused on traditional storytelling</a>, as well as audio-recorded data. But my interest in anthropology led me to focus on conversation and everyday interaction. I also recorded on video to capture social settings, gestures and sign language. And to better understand the role of the language in daily use, I worked to become a good speaker myself.</p>\n\n<p>I have compiled my documentation into a database that contains over 100,000 sentences of natural Arapaho speech. All of this has been transcribed, translated into English and accompanied by detailed linguistic analysis. </p>\n\n<p>The database is further supported by <a href=\"https://verbs.colorado.edu/ArapahoLanguageProject/index.html\">an online learning site</a> and an <a href=\"https://verbs.colorado.edu/arapaho/public/view_search\">online dictionary of around 25,000</a> entries. They are among the largest such resources for an Indigenous language, though resources do exist for other languages, <a href=\"https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/%7Eyurok/web/resources.php\">such as Yurok</a>. </p>\n\n<p><audio preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\" data-duration=\"1\" data-image=\"\" data-title=\"\" data-size=\"14109\" data-source=\"Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.\" data-source-url=\"\" data-license=\"\" data-license-url=\"\">\n        <source src=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/audio/3229/hinonoeini-noo.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n      </audio>\n      <div class=\"audio-player-caption\">\n        \n        <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.</span><span class=\"download\"><span>13.8 KB</span> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/audio/3229/hinonoeini-noo.mp3\">(download)</a></span></span>\n      </div></p>\n\n<h2>From documentation to curriculum</h2>\n\n<p>In response to the Arapaho people’s goal of language revitalization, my own work has shifted from documentation to assisting teachers, students and curriculum developers. The database turns out to have great value in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Adult learners can watch the videos along with the Arapaho transcriptions or English translations, or both, and review the detailed grammatical analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is quite difficult for young learners to immediately benefit from listening to natural discourse. That’s why carefully graded curricula are crucial. Unlike for commonly taught languages such as French or Spanish, materials for most <a href=\"https://www.aildi.arizona.edu/nalrc-resources\">Native American languages are just being developed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Arapaho can be challenging to learn because its structure is quite different from English. Many small chunks of meaning are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho_language\">combined to produce long, complex words</a>. For example, an English speaker can start with “happy” and produce “un-happi-ness.” Arapaho speakers typically add three, four or even five prefixes, and multiple suffixes as well. A speaker can say the word “niibeetwonwoteekoohunoo” – which has six separate meaningful chunks. This translates to English, “I want to go and drive to town.”</p>\n\n<p>There is little value in memorizing such complex words, just as English learners don’t memorize entire sentences. Instead, Arapaho learners need to understand the separate parts, and how they combine.</p>\n\n<p>Previous efforts have succeeded in <a href=\"https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/TIL_3.html\">teaching children to speak basic Arapaho</a>. The challenge now is to keep improving their Arapaho language abilities, using a graded curriculum that continues through all school levels.</p>\n\n<p>The database can identify and label the individual chunks of words, and assign meanings to each chunk. A beginner’s dictionary of 1,300 entries has been created by calculating the overall frequency of base words in the 100,000 sentences, and then selecting only the most common ones. </p>\n\n<p>The list has been broken down further to produce target vocabulary for each grade level. Smaller chunks of prefixes and suffixes are also measured, and sequential grammar-learning goals can be produced based on frequency and complexity.</p>\n\n<p>A draft Arapaho learning sequence has been created, with 44 stages. It is now possible for the first time to produce a full, progressive language curriculum for Arapaho. The next step is to develop more curricular materials and train teachers to use them. </p>\n\n<p>The sequence of 44 stages is now being introduced at <a href=\"https://www.wyomingindianschools.com/o/wie\">Wyoming Indian Elementary School</a>, the first school on the Wind River Reservation to pioneer dual-language classrooms.</p>\n\n<h2>Limitations of technology</h2>\n\n<p>Technology is not a magic bullet, however. Only Native people can save their languages, by choosing to learn and speak them. </p>\n\n<p>Because <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models\">artificial intelligence works using large language models</a>, it needs billions of words of discourse to be trained effectively in a language. No Indigenous language has nearly that amount of data, so the capacity of AI to <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/policy/mind-the-language-gap-mapping-the-challenges-of-llm-development-in-low-resource-language-contexts\">address Native language endangerment is limited</a>. Moreover, <a href=\"https://aipi.asu.edu/blog/2025/07/tribal-sovereignty-age-ai-exploring-opportunities-and-risks-tribal-nations\">many Indigenous communities are wary of AI</a> due to concerns over <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2025/08/indigenous-sovereignty-ai-era\">data sovereignty and cultural property</a> rights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a red gingham shirt holds a colorful quilted blanket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The author, Andrew Cowell, is recognized for his Arapaho language revitalization at a 2018 ceremony on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>My own old-fashioned experience as a learner and teacher has proved crucial.

Yet, not everyone who dons the red suit fits this stereotype.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what <a href=\"https://www.cob.niu.edu/about/directory/cockburn.shtml\">Bethany Cockburn</a>, <a href=\"https://business.oregonstate.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/bori-borbala-csillag\">Borbala Csillag</a> and I learned when we teamed up to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2023.1161\">study professional Santas</a>. For our study, we looked into how these professional Santas were able to “be” Santa, even if they didn’t fully fit the image.</p>\n\n<p>As we explained in a forthcoming article in the Academy of Management Journal, many who do this work don’t see it as just a job – <a href=\"https://embraceourcalling.com/is-calling-the-same-as-passion/\">it’s a calling</a>. For some professional Santas, it’s especially important that they look and feel like Santa to experience that sense of purpose in their work.</p>\n\n<p>We surveyed 849 professional Santas who live across the U.S. and interviewed 53 of them, collecting data between 2018 and 2021. We identified three types of professional Santas: prototypical (64%), semi-prototypical (23%) and nonprototypical (13%). </p>\n\n<p>Prototypical Santas look the part. They are white and overweight, have real beards and express confidence that they are the right fit.</p>\n\n<p>Semi-prototypical Santas looked the part, too, but felt like they weren’t quite suitable for a range of reasons. They might be introverted or use a fake beard.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprototypical Santas had characteristics at odds with the stereotype. They might be nonwhite, female or gay, or have a physical disability. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Man dressed as Santa holds a dog on his lap.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many Santas see their work, whether paid or volunteer, as a calling.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Photo by Gwyn Sussman</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Whereas prototypical Santas could easily slide into the Santa role, the process was more complex for the others.</p>\n\n<p>Semi-prototypical Santas did things like come up with stories they’d tell themselves or share with children to explain away their fake beards. Nonprototypical Santas had values aligned with the Santa image, such as being peaceful, loving and kind. But they still made a big effort to look like what people expect when they visit a Santa. </p>\n\n<p>“Should it be a difference if you’re a Jewish Santa Claus or a Catholic Santa Claus?” asked an atheist professional Santa we called “Santa Aquila.” “No. You’re Santa Claus.

For 43 days, the more than 42 million Americans who receive <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-20849\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a> benefits had to find other ways to stock their cupboards.</p>\n\n<p>When asked how she felt about her benefits being suspended, one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/podcasts/the-daily/snap-food-stamps-shutdown.html\">woman in West Virginia</a> told a New York Times reporter, “We’re angry. Because we do count!” </p>\n\n<p>Her sentiment reflects an often underappreciated fact about food. Food is not just a matter of survival. What and how you eat is also a symbol of your social status. Being unable to reliably feed your family healthy and nutritious foods in a way that aligns with your values can feel undignified. It can make people feel unseen and less important than others. </p>\n\n<p>As researchers who study <a href=\"https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/jbrenton\">food inequality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/9294-alyssa-tindall\">nutrition</a> and <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/fellows/fellows-directory/senbagam-virudachalam-md-mshp/\">food justice</a>, we have spent decades surveying and interviewing Americans about how they eat. We have witnessed firsthand how food assistance does help people meet their basic needs, but how it can also be stigmatizing and diminish their sense of dignity.</p>\n\n<p>We have also studied alternatives to typical charitable food programs that, despite good intentions, tend to induce shame. We have learned that it is possible to help people put food on the table while preserving their dignity.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RpGrZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpGrZ/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Dignity and food assistance</h2>\n\n<p>Addressing the root causes of food insecurity – what happens when people lack steady access to the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/food-insecurity-5704\">food they need for a nutritious diet</a> that’s in keeping with their preferences – is a persistent problem in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\">demand for SNAP benefits</a>, which help Americans buy groceries, <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/programs\">other government nutrition programs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/why-many-struggle-access-charitable-food-while-demand-remains-high\">food banks and food pantries</a> rarely declines much – even when the economy is strong. Yet relying on food assistance programs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2016.08.015\">does not tend to support a healthy diet</a> and can take a toll on mental health.</p>\n\n<p>As interviewers and clinicians, we have heard mothers describe the shame they feel when SNAP benefits do not cover the entire grocery bill. <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pressure-cooker-9780190663292?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">We have witnessed the frustration</a> that comes with walking down a food pantry aisle lined with signs instructing hungry people to “take only 1 item!”</p>\n\n<p>“The stuff looks like almost trash, but they give it to you,” one woman we interviewed said of her experience with food pantries and the like.</p>\n\n<p>These kinds of stories are not uncommon. Charitable food programs receive leftover items from grocery stores, donations from community food drives and local businesses, and sometimes surplus from local farms. Food is often damaged in transport or from being handled too many times. A review of the research found that many people who use food pantries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.10.029\">described the food as unhealthy, moldy or inedible</a>. Being given unhealthy and unappealing food in a time of need is a double burden.</p>\n\n<p>While free food may fill the stomach, it does not satisfy the desire to feel fully human and worthy of nourishment.</p>\n\n<p>People who visit food banks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.029\">have told researchers that they have come to expect</a> low-quality food and few choices. When food aid is provided that way, it can leave the people it is supposed to help <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19320248.2022.2052782\">feeling powerless</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.04.021\">ashamed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These indignities are compounded by the fact that people who visit food banks and food pantries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00909882.2022.2079954\">routinely face suspicion and surveillance</a> around what they buy and how they eat, intensifying the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuac029\">stress associated with food insecurity</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In our research, we saw cashiers hovering over mothers using <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/ebt\">SNAP EBT cards</a> in the self-checkout line. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5595920/snap-usda-rollins-fraud\">Politicians routinely suggest that SNAP is corrupt</a>, contributing to nationwide perceptions that people who rely on this program are unfairly gaming the system. One study found that more than two-thirds of the Americans people who get food assistance have been the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.117959\">target of hostile comments and interactions from strangers at the grocery store</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Minimizing stigma</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0160597617733623\">Several studies</a> have shown that food programs do not need to sacrifice dignity to offer help. Programs that offer opportunities for people with lower incomes to receive and give back are important. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12251\">In Canada, bulk-buying food cooperatives</a> did just that. Food assistance programs confer dignity when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19320248.2022.2052782\">make people feel good</a>.

Intentionally cultivating food dignity may be the next step.</p>\n\n<p>Our assessment of a nationwide meal kit program demonstrated how dignity can be cultivated when food assistance programs consider the nutritional, emotional, aesthetic and cultural dimensions of food and eating.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, we conducted 116 interviews with participants of a meal kit program called <a href=\"https://www.ahealthieramerica.org/pass-the-love-w-waffles-mochi-29\">Pass the Love</a>. The program was free and anyone could enroll, no questions asked. The meal kits contained the necessary food and recipes to make three vegetarian meals a week, such as sesame coconut noodle salad or carrot coconut dal with rice. The program ran for four consecutive weeks.</p>\n\n<p>When we interviewed participants about their experiences during and after the program, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118009\">we learned</a> that while they were thankful for the free food, what mattered more was the high quality, how it was packaged and how it conveyed care and respect.</p>\n\n<p>Most participants had incomes at or well below the poverty line. They described what we came to call a “high dignity food experience,” meaning that it generated positive feelings and a sense of worth.</p>\n\n<p>Opening the nicely packaged meal kit boxes each week felt like “Christmas,” to some people and a “gift” to others. Many found the “thought and care” that went into the program remarkable. Offering high-quality food to make nutritious, complete meals symbolized that low-income or food-insecure people deserve to eat well and feel good.</p>\n\n<p>Our research, like similar studies that others have conducted, shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huaf016\">treating food as a basic human right</a> requires more than just giving people something to eat. It means ensuring unconditional access to the culturally appropriate fresh and nutritious food people need to thrive not just physically, but psychologically and socially.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269171/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joslyn Brenton received funding from Partnership for a Healthier America as an external research expert. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Virudachalam received funding from the Edna G.

As a scholar who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=RYxWeRcAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies information retrieval</a>, I see that this shift of the tool people reach for first for finding information is at the heart of how ChatGPT has changed everyday technology use.</p>\n\n<h2>Change in searching</h2>\n\n<p>The biggest change isn’t that other tools have vanished. It’s that ChatGPT has become the new front door to information. Within months of its introduction on Nov. 30, 2022, ChatGPT had 100 million weekly users. By late 2025, that figure had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-users-openai-sam-altman-devday-llm-artificial-intelligence-2025-10\">grown to 800 million</a>. That makes it one of the most widely used consumer technologies on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Surveys show that this use isn’t just curiosity – it reflects a real change in behavior. A 2025 Pew Research Center study found that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/06/25/34-of-us-adults-have-used-chatgpt-about-double-the-share-in-2023/\">34% of U.S. adults have used ChatGPT</a>, roughly double the share found in 2023. Among adults under 30, a clear majority (58%) have tried it. An AP-NORC poll reports that about 60% of U.S. adults who use AI <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-poll-229b665d10d057441a69f56648b973e1\">say they use it to search for information</a>, making this the most common AI use case. The number rises to 74% for the under-30 crowd. </p>\n\n<p>Traditional search engines are still the backbone of the online information ecosystem, but the kind of searching people do has shifted in measurable ways since ChatGPT entered the scene. People are changing which tool they reach for first.</p>\n\n<p>For years, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/06/1108679/ai-generative-search-internet-breakthroughs/\">Google was the default</a> for everything from “how to reset my router” to “explain the debt ceiling.” These basic informational queries made up a huge portion of search traffic. But these quick, clarifying, everyday “what does this mean” questions are the ones ChatGPT now answers faster and more cleanly than a page of links. </p>\n\n<p>And people have noticed. A 2025 U.S. consumer survey found that 55% of respondents now use OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini AI chatbots <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/ai-search-is-exploding-6-tasks-people-are-now-giving-to-ai-instead-of-google\">about tasks they previously would have asked Google search</a> to help them with, with even higher usage figures for the U.K. Another analysis of more than 1 billion search sessions found that traffic from generative AI platforms is <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/blog/seo/gen-ai-search-trends/\">growing 165 times faster than traditional searches</a>, and about 13 million U.S. adults have already made generative AI their go-to tool for online discovery.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean people have stopped “Googling,” but it means ChatGPT has peeled off the kinds of questions for which users want a direct explanation instead of a list of links. Curious about a policy update? Need a definition? Want a polite way to respond to an uncomfortable email? ChatGPT is faster, feels more conversational and feels more definitive.  </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Google isn’t standing still. Its search results look different than they did three years ago because Google started weaving its AI system Gemini directly into the top of the page. The “AI Overview” summaries that appear above traditional search links now instantly answer many simple questions – sometimes accurately, sometimes less so. </p>\n\n<p>But either way, many people never scroll past that AI-generated snapshot. This fact combined with the impact of ChatGPT are the reasons the number of “zero-click” searches has surged. One report using Similarweb data found that traffic from Google to news sites fell from over 2.3 billion visits in mid-2024 <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/media/google-ai-tools-depressing-traffic-to-news-sites-report/\">to under 1.7 billion in May 2025</a>, while the share of news-related searches ending in zero clicks jumped from 56% to 69% in one year.</p>\n\n<p>Google search excels at pointing to a wide range of sources and perspectives, but the results can feel cluttered and designed more for clicks than clarity. ChatGPT, by contract, delivers a more focused and conversational response that prioritizes explanation over ranking. The ChatGPT response can lack the source transparency and multiple viewpoints often found in a Google search.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of accuracy, both tools can occasionally get it wrong. Google’s strength lies in letting users cross-check multiple sources, while ChatGPT’s accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the prompt and the<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-search-answers-are-the-fast-food-of-your-information-diet-convenient-and-tasty-but-no-substitute-for-good-nutrition-230759\"> user’s ability to recognize when a response should be verified elsewhere</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-MOQcIqhXo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">OpenAI is aiming to make it even more appealing to turn to ChatPGT first for search by trying to get people to use a browser with ChatGPT built in.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Smart speakers and YouTube</h2>\n\n<p>The impact of ChatGPT has reverberated beyond search engines. Voice assistants, such as Alexa speakers and Google Home, continue to report high ownership, but that number is down slightly. One 2025 summary of voice-search statistics estimates that <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/blog/voice-search-stats/\">about 34% of people ages 12 and up own a smart speaker</a>, down from 35% in 2023. This is not a dramatic decline, but the lack of growth may indicate a shift of more complex queries to ChatGPT or similar tools. When people want a detailed explanation, a step-by-step plan or help drafting something, a voice assistant that answers in a short sentence suddenly feels limited.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, YouTube remains a giant. As of 2024, it had <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/\">approximately 2.74 billion users</a>, with that number increasing steadily since 2010. Among U.S. teens, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/\">about 90% say they use YouTube</a>, making it the most widely used platform in that age group. But what kind of videos people are looking for is changing.</p>\n\n<p>People now tend to start with ChatGPT and then move to YouTube if they need the additional information a how-to video conveys. For many everyday tasks, such as “explain my health benefits” or “help me write a complaint email,” people ask ChatGPT for a summary, script or checklist. They head to YouTube only if they need to see a physical process.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a similar pattern in more specialized spaces. Software engineers, for instance, have long relied on sites such as Stack Overflow for tips and pieces of software code. But question volume there began dropping sharply after ChatGPT’s release, and one analysis suggests <a href=\"https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2025/jan/21/stack-overflows-decline/\">overall traffic fell by about 50% between 2022 and 2024</a>. When a chatbot can generate a code snippet and an explanation on demand, fewer people bother typing a question into a public forum.</p>\n\n<h2>So where does that leave us?</h2>\n\n<p>Three years in, ChatGPT hasn’t replaced the rest of the tech stack; it’s reordered it. The default search has shifted. Search engines are still for deep dives and complex comparisons. YouTube is still for seeing real people do real things. Smart speakers are still for hands-free convenience.  </p>\n\n<p>But when people need to figure something out, many now start with a chat conversation, not a search box. That’s the real ChatGPT effect: It didn’t just add another app to our phones – it quietly changed how we look things up in the first place.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270143/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Deborah Lee does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

These are essentially high-tech, 3D computer models of cities. They are filled with data about buildings, roads and utilities. Built using precision tools like cameras and LiDAR – light detection and ranging – scanners, these twins are great at showing what a city looks like physically.</p>\n\n<p>But in their rush to map the concrete, researchers, software developers and city planners have <a href=\"https://www.geoweeknews.com/news/urban-digital-twin-models-complexity-ai\">missed the most dynamic part of urban life</a>: people. People move, live and interact inside those buildings and on those streets.</p>\n\n<p>This omission creates a serious problem. While an urban digital twin may perfectly replicate the buildings and infrastructure, it often ignores how people use the parks, walk on the sidewalks, or find their way to the bus. This is an incomplete picture; it cannot truly help solve complex urban challenges or guide fair development.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome this problem, digital twins will need to widen their focus beyond physical objects and incorporate realistic human behaviors. Though there is ample data about a city’s inhabitants, using it poses a significant privacy risk. I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=Vz8kG8IAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">public affairs and planning scholar</a>. My colleagues and I believe the solution to producing more complete urban digital twins is to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X251383141\">use synthetic data</a> that closely approximates real people’s data.“</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2hnoGo27uf8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Digital twins are more than simulations.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The privacy barrier</h2>\n\n<p>To build a humane, inclusive digital twin, it’s critical to include detailed data on how people behave. And the model should represent the diversity of a city’s population, including families with young children, disabled residents and retirees. Unfortunately, relying solely on real-world data is impractical and ethically challenging.</p>\n\n<p>The primary obstacles are significant, starting with strict privacy laws. Rules such as the <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation</a>, or GDPR, often prevent researchers and others from widely sharing sensitive personal information. This wall of privacy stops researchers from easily comparing results and limits our ability to learn from past studies.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, real-world data is often unfair. Data collection tends to be uneven, missing large groups of people. Training a computer model using data where low-income neighborhoods have sparse sensor coverage means the model will simply repeat and even magnify that original unfairness. To compensate for this, researchers can use the statistical technique of <a href=\"https://methods.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/chpt/weighting#_\">weighting the data</a> in the models to make up for the underrepresentation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-fake-data-is-a-good-thing-how-synthetic-data-trains-ai-to-solve-real-problems-265180\">Synthetic data</a> offers a practical solution. It is artificial information generated by computers that mimics the statistical patterns of real-world data. This protects privacy while filling critical data gaps.</p>\n\n<h2>Synthetic data: Tool for fairer cities</h2>\n\n<p>Adding synthetic human dynamics fundamentally changes digital twins. It shifts them from static models of infrastructure to dynamic simulations that show how people live in the city. By generating synthetic patterns of walking, bus riding and public space use, planners can include a wider, more inclusive range of human actions in the models.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Bogotá, Colombia, is using a digital twin to model its TransMilenio bus rapid transit system. Instead of relying only on limited or privacy-sensitive real-world sensor data, the city planners generated synthetic data to fill the digital twin. Such data artificially creates millions of simulated bus arrivals, vehicle speeds and queue lengths, all based on the statistical patterns – peak times, off-peak times – of actual <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-85316-6_10\">TransMilenio operations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This approach transforms urban planning in several crucial ways, making simulations more realistic and diverse. For example, planners can use synthetic pedestrian data to model how elderly and disabled residents would navigate a new urban design.</p>\n\n<p>It also allows for risk-free testing of ideas. Planners can simulate diverse synthetic populations to see how a new flood evacuation plan would affect various groups, all without risking anyone’s safety or privacy in the real world.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/soAjc8caTRw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Cities are increasingly building digital twins for planning and development.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Making digital twins trustworthy</h2>\n\n<p>For all the promises of synthetic data, it can only be helpful if planners can trust it. Since they base major decisions on these virtual worlds, the synthetic data must be proved to be a reliable replacement for real-world data. Planners can test this by checking to see if the main policy decisions they reach using the synthetic data are the same ones they would have made using real-world data that puts people’s privacy at risk. If the decisions match, the synthetic data is trustworthy enough to use for that planning task going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond technical checks, it’s important to consider fairness. This means routinely auditing the synthetic models to check for any hidden biases or underrepresentation across different groups. For example, planners can make sure an emergency evacuation plan in the urban digital twin works for elderly residents with mobility issues.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, I believe planners should include their communities. Establishing citizen advisory boards and designing the synthetic data and simulation scenarios directly with the people who live in the city helps ensure that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X251383141\">their experiences are accurately reflected</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By moving beyond static infrastructure to dynamic environments that include people’s behavior, synthetic data is set to play a critical role in urban planning. It will shape the resilient, inclusive and human-centered urban digital twins of the future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268847/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Wei Zhai receives funding from National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

These often large, lacy fronds lend themselves nicely to watercolor paintings and tricep tattoos alike. <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9846/pg9846-images.html\">Thoreau said it best</a>: “Nature made ferns for pure leaves, to show what she could do in that line.”</p>\n\n<p>But ferns are not just for art and gardens. While fern leaves are the most iconic part of their body, these plants are whole organisms, with stems and roots that are often underground or creeping along the soil surface. With <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.09.003\">over 400 million years of evolutionary history</a>, ferns can teach us a lot about how the diversity of planet Earth came to be. Specifically, examining their inner anatomy can reveal some of the intricacies of evolution. </p>\n\n<h2>Sums of parts or an integrated whole?</h2>\n\n<p>When one structure cannot change without altering the other, researchers consider them constrained by each other. In biology, this linkage between traits is called a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/414425\">developmental constraint</a>. It explains the limits of what possible forms organisms can take. For instance, why there aren’t square trees or mammals with wheels.</p>\n\n<p>However, constraint does not always limit form. In my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.064\">recently published research</a>, I examined the fern vascular system to highlight how changes in one part of the organism can lead to changes in another, which can generate new forms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a small, flat green circle with a brown outline, held between two fingers\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cross section of a stem of <em>Adiantum</em> in Costa Rica.

Among these believers was the 19th-century naturalist Georges Cuvier, who is lauded as the <a href=\"https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/10/proving-extinction-cuvier-and-the-elephantimorpha.html\">father of paleontology</a>. His argument against evolution was not exclusively based in faith but on a theory he called the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/tableaulment00cuvi/page/n9/mode/2up\">correlation of parts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cuvier proposed that because each part of an organism is developmentally linked to every other part, changes in one part would result in changes to another. With this theory, he argued that a single tooth or bone could be used to reconstruct an entire organism. </p>\n\n<p>He used this theory to make a larger claim: If organisms are truly integrated wholes and not merely sums of individual parts, how could evolution fashion specific traits? Since changes in one part of an organism would necessitate changes in others, he argued, small modifications would require restructuring every other part. If the individual parts of an organism are all fully integrated, evolution of particular traits could not proceed. </p>\n\n<p>However, not all of the parts of an organism are <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/77447\">tethered together</a> so tightly. Indeed, some parts can evolve at different rates and under different selection pressures. This idea was solidified as the <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/adaptation/\">concept of quasi-independence</a> in the 1970s by evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin. The idea of organisms as collections of individually evolving parts remains today, influencing how researchers and students think about evolution.</p>\n\n<h2>Fern vasculature and the process of evolution</h2>\n\n<p>Ferns are one of four lineages of land plants that have <a href=\"https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/tracheophytes/\">vascular tissues</a> – specialized sets of tubes that move water and nutrients through their bodies. These tissues are composed of vascular bundles – clusters of cells that conduct water through the stem.  </p>\n\n<p>How <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2209\">vascular bundles are arranged in fern stems</a> varies substantially. Some have as many as three to eight or more vascular bundles scattered throughout their stem. Some are arranged symmetrically, while others such as the tobacco fern – <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em> – have bundles arranged in a whimsical, smiley-face pattern.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Cross-section of a roughly oblong stem with a smiley face shape towards one end\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cross section of the rhizome of <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em>, showing the smiley-face patterning of the vascular tissues.

I set out in my own research to test whether certain types of arrangements were more resistant to drought. But contrary to my initial hypotheses – and my desire for a relationship between form and function – the arrangement of vascular bundles in the stem <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17629\">did not seem to correlate with drought tolerance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This may sound counterintuitive, but it turns out the ability of a fern to move water through its body has more to do with the size and shape of the water-conducting cells rather than how they’re arranged as a whole in the stem. This finding is analogous to looking at road maps to understand traffic patterns. The patterning of roads on a map (how cells are arranged) may be less important in determining traffic patterns than the number and size of lanes (cell size and number). </p>\n\n<p>This observation hinted at something deeper about the evolution of the vascular systems of ferns. It sent me on a journey to uncover exactly what gave rise to the varying vascular patterns of ferns.</p>\n\n<h2>Simple observations and insights into evolution</h2>\n\n<p>I wondered how this variation in the number and arrangement of vascular bundles relates to leaf placement around the stem. So I quantified this variation in vascular patterning for 27 ferns representing roughly 30% of all fern species. </p>\n\n<p>I found a striking correlation between the number of rows of leaves and the number of vascular bundles within the stem. This relationship was almost 1-to-1 in some cases. For instance, if there were three rows of leaves along the stem, there were three vascular bundles in the stem. </p>\n\n<p>What’s more, how leaves were arranged around the stem determined the spatial arrangement of bundles. If the leaves were arranged spirally (on all sides of the stem), the vascular bundles were arranged in a radial pattern.

But it runs counter to how scientists have viewed the fern vascular system for over 100 years. Many studies on fern vascular patterning have tended to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.20185\">focus on individual parts of the plant</a>, removing vascular architecture from the context of the plant as a whole and viewing it as an independently evolving pattern.</p>\n\n<p>However, this new work suggests that the arrangement of vascular bundles in fern stems is not able to change in isolation. Rather, like Cuvier’s idealized organisms, vascular patterning is linked to and explicitly determined by the number and placement of leaves along the stem. This is not to say that vascular patterns could not be adaptive to environmental conditions, but it means that the handle of evolutionary change in the number and arrangement of vascular bundles is likely changes to leaf number and placement. </p>\n\n<h2>From parochial to existential</h2>\n\n<p>While this study on ferns and their vascular system may seem parochial, it speaks to the broader question of how variation – the fuel of evolution – arises, and how evolution can proceed.</p>\n\n<p>While not all parts of an organism are so tightly linked, considering the individual as a whole – or at least sets of parts as a unit – can help researchers better understand how, and if, observable patterns can evolve in isolation. This insight takes scientists one step closer to understanding the minutia of how evolution works to generate the immense biodiversity on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these processes is also important for industry. In agricultural settings, plant and animal breeders attempt to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00745\">increase one aspect of an organism without changing another</a>. By taking a holistic approach and understanding which parts of an organism are developmentally or genetically linked and which are more quasi-independent, breeders may be able to more effectively create organisms with desired traits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Slices of  fern stem on a table\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Researchers can learn much about evolution from the stems of <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em></span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jacob S.

The concept of dark stars has existed for some time and could alter scientists’ understanding of how ordinary stars form. However, their name is somewhat misleading. </p>\n\n<p>“Dark stars” is one of those unfortunate names that, on the surface, does not accurately describe the objects it represents. Dark stars are not exactly stars, and they are certainly not dark.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the name captures the essence of this phenomenon.

For instance, the Moon is visible to the naked eye because it reflects sunlight. Atoms on the Moon’s surface absorb photons – the particles of light – sent from the Sun, causing electrons within atoms to move and send some of that light toward us.</p>\n\n<p>More advanced telescopes detect electromagnetic waves <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/electromagnetic-spectrum\">beyond the visible spectrum</a>, such as ultraviolet, infrared or radio waves. They use the same principle: Electrically charged components of atoms react to these electromagnetic waves. But how can they detect a substance – dark matter – that not only has no electric charge but also has no electrically charged components? </p>\n\n<p>Although scientists don’t know the exact nature of dark matter, many models suggest that it is made up of electrically neutral particles – those without an electric charge. This trait makes it impossible to observe dark matter in the same way that we observe ordinary matter. </p>\n\n<p>Dark matter is thought to be made of particles that are their own antiparticles. Antiparticles are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/antiparticle\">the “mirror” versions of particles</a>. They have the same mass but opposite electric charge and other properties. When a particle encounters its antiparticle, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/antimatter-we-cracked-how-gravity-affects-it-heres-what-it-means-for-our-understanding-of-the-universe-214285\">the two annihilate each other</a> in a burst of energy. </p>\n\n<p>If dark matter particles are their own antiparticles, they would annihilate upon colliding with each other, potentially releasing large amounts of energy. Scientists predict that this process plays a key role in the formation of dark stars, as long as the density of dark matter particles inside these stars is sufficiently high. The dark matter density determines how often dark matter particles encounter, and annihilate, each other. If the dark matter density inside dark stars is high, they would annihilate frequently.</p>\n\n<h2>What makes a dark star shine?</h2>\n\n<p>The concept of dark stars stems from a fundamental yet unresolved question in astrophysics: <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/star-formation\">How do stars form</a>? In the widely accepted view, clouds of primordial hydrogen and helium — the chemical elements formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang, approximately 13.8 billion years ago — collapsed under gravity. They heated up and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/nuclear-fusion/Fusion-reactions-in-stars\">initiated nuclear fusion</a>, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/elements-from-the-stars-the-unexpected-discovery-that-upended-astrophysics-66-years-ago-93916\">formed heavier elements</a> from the hydrogen and helium. This process led to the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-first-stars-may-not-have-been-as-uniformly-massive-as-astronomers-thought-263016\">formation of the first generation of stars</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two bright clouds of gas condensing around a small central region\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stars form when clouds of dust collapse inward and condense around a small, bright, dense core.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2219a/\">NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI, J.

But what if dark matter had a more active role in the process? That’s exactly the question a group of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.051101\">astrophysicists raised in 2008</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the dense environment of the early universe, dark matter particles would <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/measuring-helium-in-distant-galaxies-may-give-physicists-insight-into-why-the-universe-exists-205891\">collide with, and annihilate, each other</a>, releasing energy in the process. This energy could heat the hydrogen and helium gas, preventing it from further collapse and delaying, or even preventing, the typical ignition of nuclear fusion. </p>\n\n<p>The outcome would be a starlike object — but one powered by dark matter heating instead of fusion. Unlike regular stars, these dark stars might live much longer because they would continue to shine as long as they attracted dark matter. This trait would make them distinct from ordinary stars, as their cooler temperature would result in lower emissions of various particles.</p>\n\n<h2>Can we observe dark stars?</h2>\n\n<p>Several unique characteristics help astronomers <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/79/6/066902\">identify potential dark stars</a>. First, these objects must be very old. As the universe expands, the frequency of light coming from <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-doppler-0803\">objects far away from Earth decreases</a>, shifting toward the infrared end of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning it gets “redshifted.” The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-theory-predicts-physicists-are-searching-for-new-ideas-that-might-explain-the-mismatch-215414\">oldest objects appear the most redshifted</a> to observers.</p>\n\n<p>Since dark stars form from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-first-stars-may-not-have-been-as-uniformly-massive-as-astronomers-thought-263016\">primordial hydrogen and helium</a>, they are expected to contain little to no heavier elements, such as oxygen. They would be very large and cooler on the surface, yet highly luminous because their size — and the surface area emitting light — compensates for their lower surface brightness. </p>\n\n<p>They are also expected to be enormous, with radii of about tens of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomical-unit\">astronomical units</a> — a cosmic distance measurement equal to the average distance between Earth and the Sun. Some supermassive dark stars are theorized to reach masses of roughly 10,000 to 10 million times that of the Sun, depending on how much dark matter and hydrogen or helium gas they can accumulate during their growth. </p>\n\n<p>So, have astronomers observed dark stars? Possibly. Data from the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed some very high-redshift objects that seem brighter — and possibly more massive — than what scientists expect of typical early galaxies or stars. These results have led some researchers to propose that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.06101\">dark stars might explain these objects</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Artist's impression of the James Webb telescope, which has a hexagonal mirror made up of smaller hexagons, and sits on a rhombus-shaped spacecraft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The James Webb Space Telescope, shown in this illustration, detects light coming from objects in the universe.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/jwst_in_space.jpg\">Northrup Grumman/NASA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In particular, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.06101\">a recent study analyzing James Webb Space Telescope data</a> identified three candidates consistent with supermassive dark star models. Researchers looked at how much helium these objects contained to identify them. Since it is dark matter annihilation that heats up those dark stars, rather than nuclear fusion turning helium into heavier elements, dark stars should have more helium.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers highlight that one of these objects indeed exhibited a potential “smoking gun” helium absorption signature: a far higher helium abundance than one would expect in typical early galaxies.</p>\n\n<h2>Dark stars may explain early black holes</h2>\n\n<p>What happens when a dark star runs out of dark matter? It depends on the size of the dark star. For the lightest dark stars, the depletion of dark matter would mean gravity compresses the remaining hydrogen, igniting nuclear fusion. In this case, the dark star would eventually become an ordinary star, so some stars may have begun as dark stars.</p>\n\n<p>Supermassive dark stars are even more intriguing. At the end of their lifespan, a dead supermassive dark star would collapse directly into a black hole. This black hole could start the formation of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-black-holes-bigger-than-others-an-astronomer-explains-how-these-celestial-vacuums-grow-217241\">supermassive black hole</a>, like the kind astronomers observe at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way.</p>\n\n<p>Dark stars might also explain how supermassive black holes formed in the early universe. They could shed light on some <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/chandra/nasa-telescopes-discover-record-breaking-black-hole/\">unique black holes observed by astronomers</a>. For example, a black hole in the galaxy UHZ-1 has a mass approaching 10 million solar masses, and is very old – it formed just 500 million years after the Big Bang. Traditional models struggle to explain how such massive black holes could form so quickly. </p>\n\n<p>The idea of dark stars is not universally accepted. These dark star candidates might still turn out just to be unusual galaxies. Some astrophysicists argue that matter accretion — a process in which <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/how-do-the-most-massive-stars-get-so-big\">massive objects pull in surrounding matter</a> — alone can produce massive stars, and that studies using observations from the James Webb telescope cannot distinguish between massive ordinary stars and less dense, cooler dark stars. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers emphasize that they will need more observational data and theoretical advancements to solve this mystery.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266971/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alexey A Petrov receives funding from the US Department of Energy. </span></em></p>",

And that depends on future greenhouse gas emissions from sources including vehicles, power plants and industries. </p>\n\n<p>Studies suggest that much of the Antarctic ice sheet could survive if countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 2015 <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement goal</a> to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared to before the industrial era. However, if emissions continue rising and the atmosphere and oceans warm much more, that could cause substantial melting and much higher sea levels.</p>\n\n<p>Our research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64438-3\">high emissions pose risks</a> not just to the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is already contributing to sea-level rise, but also for the much larger and <a href=\"https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/antarctica-2/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-2/marine-ice-sheets/\">more stable</a> East Antarctic ice sheet. </p>\n\n<p>It also shows how different regions of the world will experience different levels of sea-level rise as Antarctica melts.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding sea-level change</h2>\n\n<p>If sea levels rose like the water in a bathtub, then as ice sheets melt, the ocean would rise by the same amount everywhere. But that isn’t what happens.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, many places experience higher regional sea-level rise than the global average, while places close to the ice sheet can even see sea levels drop. The main reason has to do with gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ice sheets are massive, and that mass creates a strong gravitational pull that attracts the surrounding ocean water toward them, similar to how the gravitational <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides\">pull between Earth and the Moon affects the tides</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the ice sheet shrinks, its gravitational <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nHr7_qsBLOo?si=Hr-tDxt02j4nA54S\">pull on the ocean declines</a>, leading to sea levels falling in regions close to the ice sheet coast and rising farther away. But sea-level changes are not only a function of distance from the melting ice sheet. This ice loss also changes how the planet rotates. The rotation axis is pulled toward that missing ice mass, which in turn redistributes water around the globe. </p>\n\n<h2>2 factors that can slow melting</h2>\n\n<p>As the massive ice sheet melts, the solid Earth beneath it rebounds.</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the bedrock of Antarctica is Earth’s mantle, which flows slowly like maple syrup. The more the ice sheet melts, the less it presses down on the solid Earth. With less weight on it, <a href=\"https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/comic-corner/isostatic-rebound/\">the bedrock can rebound</a>. This can lift parts of the ice sheet out of contact with warming ocean waters, slowing the rate of melting. This happens quicker in places where the mantle flows faster, such as underneath the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>\n\n<p>This rebound effect <a href=\"https://blog.ucs.org/shaina-sadai/our-new-research-says-the-solid-earth-can-help-protect-the-antarctic-ice-sheet-only-if-we-cut-emissions-now/\">could help preserve</a> the ice sheet – if global greenhouse gas emissions are kept low.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHr7_qsBLOo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA explains how land rebounds when ice sheets melts. NASA via Virtual Palaeosciences.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Another factor that can slow melting might seem counterintuitive.</p>\n\n<p>While Antarctic meltwater drives rising sea levels, models show it also delays greenhouse gas-induced warming. That’s because icy meltwater from Antarctica reduces ocean surface temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical Pacific, trapping heat in the deep ocean and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64438-3\">slowing the rise of global average air temperature</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But as melting occurs, even if it slows, sea levels rise.</p>\n\n<h2>Mapping our sea-level results</h2>\n\n<p>We combined computer models that simulate these and other behaviors of the Antarctic ice sheet, solid Earth and climate to understand what could happen to sea level around the world as global temperatures rise and ice melts. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in a moderate scenario in which the world <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0151-4\">reduces greenhouse gas emissions</a>, though not enough to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) in 2100, we found the average sea-level rise from Antarctic ice melt would be about 4 inches (0.1  meters) by 2100. By 2200, it would be more than 3.3 feet (1  meter). </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is only sea-level rise caused by Antarctic melt. The Greenland ice sheet and thermal expansion of seawater as the oceans warm will also raise sea levels. Current estimates suggest that <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter13_FINAL.pdf\">total average sea-level rise</a> – including Greenland and thermal expansion – would be 1 to 2 feet (0.32 to 0.63 meters) by 2100 under the same scenario.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two maps of the earth showing differing sea level rise\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Models show Antarctica’s contribution to sea-level rise in 2200 under medium (top) and high (bottom) emissions.

This exercise, however, highlights the serious consequences of high emissions and underscores the importance of reducing emissions.</p>\n\n<h2>The takeaway</h2>\n\n<p>These impacts have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF002940\">implications for climate justice</a>, particularly for island nations that have done little to contribute to climate change yet already experience the devastating impacts of sea-level rise.</p>\n\n<p>Many island nations are already losing land to sea-level rise, and they have been <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154911\">leading global efforts</a> to minimize temperature rise.

At its best, this type of early care sets <a href=\"https://acf.gov/opre/report/childrens-learning-and-development-benefits-high-quality-early-care-and-education\">kids up for long-term success</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But educators who are experiencing poor mental health are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-025-01949-0\">less able to cultivate</a> positive relationships with the children in their care, which negatively affects the children’s development.</p>\n\n<p>“We work in a field that has a high demand for kids to be safe and enjoy learning,” one educator told us. “We have … little people that depend on us, parents depend on us, and we need to make sure that we are there for the kids when they need us.” </p>\n\n<p>Our research team – led by a <a href=\"https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/resources/directory/directory-profile/Puma-Jini-UCD3515\">clinical associate professor</a> and a <a href=\"https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/resources/directory/directory-profile/Farewell-Charlotte-UCD36897\">research assistant professor</a> in public health – set out to learn how child care workers were coping with all of this responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>What we learned was concerning and needs to be understood by parents and policymakers alike. </p>\n\n<h2>Studying 42 Head Start centers</h2>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-024-01644-6\">peer-reviewed study examined the mental health</a> of 332 early child care educators and other staff at 42 <a href=\"https://headstart.gov\">Head Start</a> centers in the Denver metropolitan area and southeast Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>We found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-024-01644-6\">roughly 25% of early child care</a> staff in Colorado self-reported discrimination and condescending or demeaning treatment from a colleague in the past year, with 15% experiencing more than one kind. </p>\n\n<p>We measured discrimination tied to age, race, ethnicity and gender. We also measured types of demeaning treatment, which included bullying, harassment and condescending behavior. And we looked at physical violence.</p>\n\n<p>Higher levels of workplace mistreatment were related to greater numbers of poor mental health days. The child care staff we surveyed reported an average of seven poor mental health days in the month prior to completing the survey. </p>\n\n<h2>Mistreatment in early childhood education</h2>\n\n<p>The early child care workforce also reports <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-020-01143-4\">higher rates of depression than the national workforce</a>.</p>\n\n<p>High stress of educators and staff even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568543.2019.1705446\">pushes some workers out of the profession</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-024-01677-x\">Working conditions</a> matter, too, with early child care workers reporting substantial <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-020-01124-7\">physical and psychological workplace challenges</a>, such as lifting and carrying children, as well as managing a wide range of ages and capabilities among children in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>Our survey also revealed that 1 in 4 early child care staff experienced condescending or demeaning treatment by colleagues or superiors in the past 12 months. This was the most common type of workplace mistreatment.</p>\n\n<p>In early child care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08856257.2015.1087127\">teamwork</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1836939120979064\">collegiality</a> are integral and are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorados-early-childhood-education-workers-face-burnout-and-health-disparities-but-a-wellness-campaign-could-help-250880\">linked to educator well-being</a>.

Experiences of discrimination <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/job.1988\">have an impact beyond mental health</a> and also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/racial-discrimination-ages-black-americans-faster-according-to-a-25-year-long-study-of-families-143313\">affect physical health</a>, job attitudes and engagement in the workplace. </p>\n\n<h2>Younger workers are struggling</h2>\n\n<p>Discrimination was three times as likely to be reported by the younger workforce, ages 18-29, than older workers. Discrimination between age groups <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-010-9172-7\">affects trust</a> and can reduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/JMP-06-2013-0179\">employee engagement</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Mistreatment of early child care workers can take several forms that happen at the same time. For example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/4/655/3958244\">age discrimination</a> can occur in either direction. Younger staff may be viewed by older colleagues as less experienced, less committed or less capable than more experienced colleagues. Older colleagues may be perceived to be less creative or less willing to adapt to new strategies and practices. </p>\n\n<p>Yet overall, younger workers seemed to be struggling more. Workers under 35 reported an average of eight to nine poor mental health days in a 30-day window; older workers reported an average of 5.6. </p>\n\n<h2>Improving staff well-being</h2>\n\n<p>Our study indicates a need for both societal and organizational change to prevent mistreatment of early child care staff, which can improve worker well-being and lead to better care for young children. </p>\n\n<p>At a societal level, it is important to acknowledge the integral role of the early child care workforce and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-typical-child-care-worker-in-the-us-earns-less-than-12-an-hour-160146\">compensate these workers at a level commensurate</a> with their importance. In 2023, the average U.S. preschool teacher earned an <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm#tab-5\">annual income</a> of $37,120 compared to the $63,680 <a href=\"https://careers.usnews.com/best-jobs/elementary-school-teacher/salary\">annual income of elementary school teachers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/distillation/the-case-for-better-compensation-of-early-educators/\">Adequate pay</a> and appreciation <a href=\"https://teachingstrategies.com/blog/teacher-retention-strategies-the-power-of-appreciation/\">can reduce turnover</a>. Rates of turnover are <a href=\"https://bellpolicy.org/early-childhood-education-workforce/\">four times higher among early child care educators</a> than elementary school teachers.</p>\n\n<p>“Turnover has a lot to do with pay, unfortunately, and we don’t get paid a whole lot of money,” one educator said. “And … I don’t think I’ve always felt valued in the position I’m in.” </p>\n\n<p>At an organizational level, leaders can implement health-centered policies and offer managerial training on how to build supportive teams. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13241-6\">Total Worker Health interventions</a> may also help to guide needed policy changes with input from staff. These interventions are holistic programs that focus on both the safety and well-being of workers and include elements such as environmental and social supports. They are <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55995-001.html\">shown to improve worker well-being</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One initiative <a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/journal/nurturing-the-nurturer-elevating-educator-well-being-and-competencies-through-comprehensive-wellness-programs/\">compared wellness intervention models</a> across six Early Head Start and Head Start networks nationally to address the comprehensive well-being in staff. Direct outcomes of the programs included workplace and organizational culture improvements, as well as higher staff well-being. </p>\n\n<p>We designed the <a href=\"https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/research-and-practice/centers-programs/rmprc/research-and-practice/ongoing-programs-and-projects/well-project\">WELL Program</a>, which has successfully been implemented at five Colorado-based Head Start networks. The program includes <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorados-early-childhood-education-workers-face-burnout-and-health-disparities-but-a-wellness-campaign-could-help-250880\">training to promote better sleep</a> and mindfulness. </p>\n\n<p>“WELL help(ed) people keep going every day and deal with their stress in a healthy way so it didn’t come out in the classroom, or come out against kiddos that are tough,” one participant said.</p>\n\n<p>Our study also suggests there may be generational differences in workplace communication and a varied understanding of what it is to be mistreated. Additional research on these differences may help us to address causes of mistreatment and find solutions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264666/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charlotte Farewell receives funding from the Administration for Children and Families.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jini Puma receives funding from the Administration for Children and Families. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kyla Hagan-Haynes and Virginia McCarthy do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In psychology, this idea is described as “intrinsic motivation” – working because you find the work itself satisfying. People who are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-6566(85)90023-6\">intrinsically motivated</a> tend to experience <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.66.5.950\">genuine enjoyment and curiosity in what they do</a>, relishing opportunities to learn or master challenges for their own sake. Research has long shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.48\">intrinsic motivation enhances performance</a>, persistence and creativity at work.</p>\n\n<p>Yet my and my co-authors’ <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=dSvUp0wAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">recent research</a> suggests that this seemingly innocent idea of loving your work can take on a moral edge. Increasingly, people seem to judge both themselves <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-trouble-with-passion/paper\">and others</a> according to whether they are <a href=\"https://careers.usnews.com/advice/articles/231020careers.whydoyouwanttoworkhere\">intrinsically motivated</a>. What used to be a personal preference has, for many, become a moral imperative: You should love your work, and it is somehow wrong if you don’t. </p>\n\n<h2>Moralizing motivation</h2>\n\n<p>When a neutral preference <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00139\">becomes charged with moral meaning</a>, social scientists call it “moralization.” For example, someone might initially choose vegetarianism for their own health reasons but come to view it as the right thing to do – and judge others accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">moralization of intrinsic motivation</a> follows a similar logic. People work for many reasons: passion, duty, family, security or social status. But once intrinsic motivation becomes moralized, loving what you do is seen as not only enjoyable but virtuous. Working for money, prestige or family obligation starts to look less admirable, even suspect.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2023 study, fellow business researchers <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/julia-lee-cunningham\">Julia Lee Cunningham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1175257\">Jon M. Jachimowicz</a> and I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2020.1761\">surveyed over 1,200 employees</a>, asking whether they thought working for personal enjoyment was virtuous.</p>\n\n<p>People who did, we found, tended to believe everyone else should be intrinsically motivated, too. They were also more likely to see other motives, such as working for pay or recognition, as morally inferior. They tended to agree, for example, that “you are morally obligated to love the work itself more than you love the rewards and perks.”  </p>\n\n<p>These employees had internalized the idea that you work either for love or money – even though most people, in reality, do both.</p>\n\n<h2>Costs for you</h2>\n\n<p>At first glance, treating love for work as a virtue seems to offer nothing but benefits. If a job’s mission or day-to-day tasks are personally meaningful, you may persist through challenges, because quitting could feel like betraying an ideal.</p>\n\n<p>But this virtue <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dowhatyouloveoth0000toku\">can also backfire</a>. When intrinsic motivation becomes a moral duty rather than a joy, you may feel guilty for not constantly loving your work. Emotions that are normal in any job, such as boredom, fatigue or disengagement, can prompt feelings of moral failure and self-blame. Over time, this pressure can <a href=\"https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/\">contribute to burnout</a> if you stay in unsustainable roles out of guilt. </p>\n\n<p>By idealizing your “dream job” when you’re applying, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211068660\">you may overlook security</a>, stability and other important life needs – risking financial strain and underusing your talents. This unrealistic standard could also lead you to leave a job too soon when reality disappoints or initial passion fades.</p>\n\n<h2>Costs for a company</h2>\n\n<p>Moralizing intrinsic motivation doesn’t stop at the self; it also reshapes how we judge others. People who moralize intrinsic motivation often expect it from everyone else. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2020.1761\">a study of nearly 800 employees</a> across 185 teams, we found that employees who moralized intrinsic motivation were more generous toward teammates they perceived as loving their work. However, they were less willing to help out colleagues they considered less passionate. In other words, moralizing intrinsic motivation can make employees “discerning saints” – good to some, but selectively so.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man and woman seated at an office table high-five each other in a room whose glass walls are covered with print-outs and sticky notes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Seeing intrinsic motivation as a virtue affects how people view colleagues, too.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/shot-of-two-young-designers-giving-each-other-a-royalty-free-image/1367764265?phrase=office%20passion&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">Moyo Studio/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This dynamic can create problems for work teams. Leaders who strongly moralize intrinsic motivation may adopt leadership styles aimed at igniting passion in their teams – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032516-113108\">emphasizing workers’ autonomy</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>While inspiring on the surface, this approach can alienate employees who work for more pragmatic reasons. Over time, I would argue, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">this can breed tension and conflict</a>, as some team members are celebrated as “true believers” and others are quietly marginalized. Expressing love for one’s work becomes a kind of commodity – one more way to get ahead.</p>\n\n<h2>Embracing many motives</h2>\n\n<p>People all around the world experience intrinsic motivation. But if that feeling is universal, its moralization is not. </p>\n\n<p>My current research with <a href=\"https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/laura-sonday/\">management researcher Laura Sonday</a> suggests that moralizing intrinsic motivation is more pronounced in some cultures than in others. Where work is viewed as a means of service, duty or balance, rather than a source of personal fulfillment, loving one’s job may be appreciated but not <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">treated as a moral expectation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would urge office leaders to recognize the double-edged nature of moralizing intrinsic motivation. Expressing genuine love for work can inspire others, but enforcing it as a moral norm can silence or shame those with different values or priorities. Leaders should be careful not to equate enthusiasm with virtue, or assume that passion always signals integrity or competence.</p>\n\n<p>For employees, it may be worth reflecting on how we talk about our own motivation. Loving one’s work is wonderful, but it’s also perfectly human to value stability, recognition or family needs. In a culture where “do what you love” has become a moral commandment, remembering that it’s not the be-all, end-all reason to work may be the most moral stance of all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266983/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mijeong Kwon does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Why doesn’t someone help them? What can I do about this?</p>\n\n<p>The answers to these questions are complex. However, a significant body of research suggests that there is a <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000001219\">highly effective solution</a> for many individuals who experience homelessness. It is called supportive housing. </p>\n\n<p>Supportive housing programs combine a housing subsidy – financial assistance that helps make housing affordable even for those with very low incomes – with wraparound supportive services that help a person remain stably housed. Supportive services often include case management, occupational therapy and mental health and addiction treatment. These programs have <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/media/20230331105222/OHS_2023Report_Web_SinglePages.pdf\">helped thousands of Philadelphians</a> end their experiences of homelessness.  </p>\n\n<p>As a researcher and former social worker, I have spent much of the past decade working in and studying homeless services in Philadelphia. For my <a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/199333\">dissertation research</a>, I conducted hundreds of hours of ethnographic fieldwork at a soup kitchen and outreach center in the city between 2022 and 2024. I interviewed 75 homeless services workers, volunteers and people who were experiencing or had experienced homelessness. I also analyzed hundreds of pages of policy documents.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that while the city has succeeded in centralizing services to support unhoused people, there remain major bureaucratic challenges exacerbated by insufficient funding and a shortage of supportive housing. These challenges impact both people seeking supportive housing and front-line workers trying to help them. </p>\n\n<h2>Khalil’s story</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the case of Khalil, a 48-year-old from West Philly who became homeless during the pandemic. (As for all the interviewees’ names used in this article, Khalil is a pseudonym I’m using to protect his privacy.) Khalil told me that he lost his job as an IT technician at Verizon, where he had worked for nine years. Sleeping outside and unable to afford life-sustaining kidney medication, he said, his physical and mental health spiraled. </p>\n\n<p>A supportive housing program changed that, providing him with a stable and affordable place to live, while social workers helped him enroll in Medicaid and connect with a community health clinic. This support, Khalil explained, allowed him to “transition back into residential living and back into employment and back into being a working member of society.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite the efficacy of supportive housing, cities do not receive sufficient federal funding to provide this service to all residents who are eligible. As a result, the need for these housing programs vastly outstrips the supply. </p>\n\n<p>So how do officials in Philadelphia decide who will continue to sleep on the street or in a shelter, and who can move into a supportive housing facility with a warm bed and access to valuable wraparound services?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the city determines who gets housing</h2>\n\n<p>Like other localities, Philadelphia uses a <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-homeless-services/documents/standards-policies-and-forms/#/?table=Coordinated%20Entry%20and%20Assessment-Based%20Housing%20Referral%20System%20(CEA-BHRS)\">Coordinated Entry System</a>. CES is a form of automated bureaucracy that combines several different algorithms and administrative processes with the goal of helping officials and social service workers allocate resources fairly and efficiently.  </p>\n\n<p>CES is intended to help workers identify which people experiencing homelessness are in greatest need of aid. These systems work by combining a central pool of resources like housing programs and a central list of people seeking help. Unhoused people are scored using a vulnerability assessment tool, and those that score highest are matched to an opening in a supportive housing program.</p>\n\n<p>Because most of these systems are premised on targeting resources to the most vulnerable people, defining and gauging vulnerability becomes fraught with tension. After all, vulnerability is inherently subjective, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306628\">there is no universally agreed-upon best way to measure it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These systems will soon come under even greater pressure as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development prepares to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/trump-homeless-funding.html\">slash funding for supportive housing programs</a>. As many as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/trump-cuts-homeless-housing-program-00650758\">170,000 people nationwide</a> who were previously homeless will be at risk of returning to the streets once these funding changes are implemented.</p>\n\n<h2>CES has benefits and drawbacks</h2>\n\n<p>Coordinated entry has made real progress on several long-standing challenges for Philadelphia’s homeless services system. Chief among these is centralization. </p>\n\n<p>Most resources available for people experiencing homelessness are administered by nonprofit social services organizations. Prior to CES, a person seeking assistance would separately apply to various nonprofits and put their name on multiple waiting lists. </p>\n\n<p>CES centralizes resources into a common pool, accessed through the vulnerability assessment process. As one administrator with the city’s Office of Homeless Services told me, this arrangement is “immensely more supportive and fair” than the scattered process that came before. For example, individual nonprofit providers are less able to earmark resources for clients they already work with.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are downsides to Philadelphia’s approach to CES. </p>\n\n<p>Vulnerability assessments, like those used in Philadelphia, have been criticized for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10530789.2020.1852502\">failing to capture a full picture</a> of a person’s plight. Assessments involve asking unhoused people a series of yes or no questions about their housing, health and financial history, and generate a vulnerability score based on the responses. A person who has a relatively mild experience with several different risk factors can end up with a much higher score than a person with an extremely serious experience with just a few.</p>\n\n<p>And similar to other automated assessments, <a href=\"https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/sites/stpp/files/2023-05/Risk%20Assessment%20Policy%20Brief%20Final%205.2.23_0.pdf\">such as in the criminal legal system</a>, they have the potential to <a href=\"https://homelesshub.ca/resource/coordinated-entry-systems-racial-equity-analysis-assessment-data/\">introduce racial bias into</a> allocation outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the way CES works is, by design, hidden from the people it impacts most. The ambiguity is intended to prevent people from gaming the system, but it also creates confusion for those living in shelters and on the street. Some seeking aid may hide evidence of their vulnerability, such as addiction, out of fear it will disqualify them from housing. Others may amplify their vulnerability in an effort to improve their odds of receiving help. </p>\n\n<p>The result is a perception among people experiencing homelessness that the system is unfair. </p>\n\n<p>As Andre, a 60-year-old who had been sleeping in shelters off and on for nearly a decade, told me, a person who “goes in there and tells the absolute truth, they’re put on the back burner.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Person sleeps on chairs with wheelchair nearby\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A person sleeps on a bench in the Philadelphia International Airport.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/VirusOutbreak-Pennsylvania-AirportHomeless/17f62d3dbffa45ffa2fe6107d96a422a/photo\">AP Photo/Matt Rourke</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>‘You’ve got to have a record of being homeless’</h2>\n\n<p>Leon, a 25-year-old from North Philadelphia, told me as we chatted over coffee that in order to be prioritized through CES, “You’ve got to have a record of being homeless.” </p>\n\n<p>But generating such a paper trail can be difficult. A city database tracks shelter stays that can serve as proof of homelessness, but not all shelters participate. And for those sleeping outside, like Leon, proof depends on regular interactions with outreach workers, which requires being in the right place at the right time.</p>\n\n<p>If an unhoused person cannot prove the length of their time on the street, or provide documentation of a mental health diagnosis, they may be deprioritized through CES, even if they are highly vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>For all its advantages, CES in Philly is not designed to take into account the input of unhoused people themselves. In the words of Richie, a 32-year-old who was seeking housing for himself and his pregnant wife, “There is no voice for homeless people … because homeless people don’t have a voice.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, the city has lowered barriers to participating in CES. For example, the city has launched a pilot program involving <a href=\"https://phlcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/City-Council-FY24-Budget-Questions_OHS.pdf\">mobile assessors</a> who can complete assessments in different locations beyond city shelters, such as at soup kitchens, to meet unhoused people where they are. </p>\n\n<h2>3 ways to improve the system</h2>\n\n<p>Here are three concrete ways the city could reduce more of the bureaucratic hurdles to supportive housing. </p>\n\n<p>First, the city could expand pathways to supportive housing through a model called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306628\">multiprinciple allocation</a>. This approach combines different methods for determining who gets housing. Some subsidies could be allocated through new vulnerability assessments that are better vetted for bias, while others are distributed based on length of homelessness or a lottery system. This could bolster fairness by ensuring that people whose vulnerability is not picked up through the assessment tool could still have a shot at aid. </p>\n\n<p>Second, the city could provide opportunities for unhoused people and front-line workers to attest to vulnerability and experiences of homelessness in their own words – allowing someone to say, “I am struggling with housing for reasons that the assessment did not cover.” </p>\n\n<p>And third, Philadelphia could reduce the degree of automation in the CES matching process. As things stand, people with high scores are mechanically matched to open programs, even if that program is a poor fit for the individual person. Giving staff and unhoused people more agency in making housing matches could produce better outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>No amount of tinkering with CES can address the fundamental resource constraints that shape the fight against homelessness in Philadelphia. Simply put, Philadelphia lacks sufficient funding for housing the most vulnerable. But thoughtful changes to CES could make the response to homelessness more effective, compassionate and fair. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266563/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Pelle G.

Unlike traditional academic graduate programs, which are often centered on research and scholarship, these professionally oriented degrees are designed primarily for workforce advancement and typically charge much higher tuition.</p>\n\n<p>These programs are often expensive for students and are sometimes described as <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/masters-programs-are-cash-cows-for-universities-do-they-pay-off-for-students/\">cash-cow</a> degrees for colleges and universities, because the tuition revenue far exceeds the instructional costs.</p>\n\n<p>Some universities and colleges also leverage their brands to offer online, executive or certificate-based versions of these programs, attracting many students from the U.S. and abroad who pay the full tuition. This <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/how-microcredentials-are-revolutionizing-the-higher-education-business-model\">steady revenue</a> helps universities subsidize tuition for other students who cannot pay the full rate, among other things. </p>\n\n<p>Yet a quiet tension underlies this evolution in higher education – the widening divide between practical, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/masters-programs-are-cash-cows-for-universities-do-they-pay-off-for-students/\">technical training and a comprehensive education</a> that perhaps is more likely to encourage students to inquire, reflect and innovate as they learn. </p>\n\n<h2>An overlooked factor</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.texaseducationinfo.org/Home/Topic/employment_and_earnings_by_education?\">Some states, including Texas</a>, track salary data for graduates of every program to measure worth through short-term earnings. This approach may strike many students and their families as useful, but I believe it overlooks a part of what makes higher education valuable. </p>\n\n<p>A healthy higher education system depends not only on producing employable graduates but also on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023119859708\">cultivating citizens</a> and leaders who can interpret uncertainty, question assumptions and <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/policy-statements/defense-knowledge-and-higher-education\">connect ideas</a> across disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>When assessing disciplines such as English, philosophy, history and world languages, I think that we should acknowledge their contributions to critical thought, communication and ethical reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>These academic disciplines encourage students to synthesize ideas, construct arguments and engage in meaningful debate. Some law schools often draw their <a href=\"https://nationaljurist.com/classics-philosophy-majors-do-best-when-it-comes-getting-law-school/\">strongest students</a> from <a href=\"https://fgcu360.com/2025/01/03/why-nothing-matters-philosophy-as-a-stepping-stone-to-law/\">these backgrounds</a> because they nurture analytical and rhetorical skills essential for navigating complex civic and legal issues.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, poets and writers have often been among the first to be <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/pen-america-writers-gaza-israel/678272/\">silenced by authoritarian regimes</a>. It’s a reminder of the societal power of inquiry and expression that I believe higher education should protect.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of young people wear white jackets and stand around a dummy dressed with a pink blanket over it in a hospital bed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Undergraduate students who want to become doctors or work in other specialized fields are often encouraged to take only classes that connect with their long-term career trajectory.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nursing-school-students-work-in-the-new-simulation-lab-in-news-photo/2218446333?adppopup=true\">Glenn Beil/Florida A&amp;M University via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why students stay on narrow professional paths</h2>\n\n<p>Students entering college today face significant pressure to choose what they might see as safe majors that will result in a well-paying career. For aspiring physicians and engineers, the path is often <a href=\"https://careerservices.upenn.edu/academic-planning-for-medical-school/\">scripted early</a> by <a href=\"https://hms.harvard.edu/education-admissions/md-program/admissions/preparing-apply/prerequisite-courses\">steering them toward</a> physical and biosciences. High test scores, internships and other stepping stones are treated as nonnegotiable. Parents and peers can reinforce this mindset. </p>\n\n<p>Most colleges and universities do not reward a future medical student who wants to major in comparative literature, or an engineering student who is spending time on philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>Students’ majors also typically place course requirements on them, in addition to a school’s general course requirements. This often does not leave a lot of room for students to experiment with different classes, especially if they are pursuing vocationally focused majors, such as engineering. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, I’ve seen many students trade curiosity for credentialing, believing that professional identity must come before intellectual exploration.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dsri.uiowa.edu/people/daniel-mcgehee\">As someone who began</a> my education in psychology and later transitioned into engineering, I have seen how different intellectual traditions approach the same human questions. Psychology teaches people to observe behavior and design experiments. Engineering trains students to model systems and optimize performance.</p>\n\n<p>When combined, they help reveal how humans interact with technology and how technological solutions reshape human behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, these are questions neither field can answer alone.</p>\n\n<h2>Initiative is the missing ingredient</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most important and often overlooked ingredients in thriving high tech, medical and business environments is initiative. I believe students in the humanities routinely practice taking initiative by framing questions, interpreting incomplete information and proposing original arguments. These skills are crucial for scientific or business innovation, but they are often not emphasized in structured science, technology, engineering and mathematics – or STEM – coursework.  </p>\n\n<p>Initiative involves the willingness to move first and to see around corners, defining the next what-if, rallying others and building something meaningful even when the path is uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>To help my engineering students practice taking initiative, I often give them deliberately vague instructions – something they rarely experience in their coursework. Many students, even highly capable ones, hesitate to take initiative because their schooling experience has largely rewarded caution and compliance over exploration. They wait for clarity or for permission – not because they lack ability, but because they are afraid to be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in business, research labs, design studios, hospitals and engineering firms, initiative is the quality employers most urgently need and cannot easily teach. Broader educational approaches help cultivate this confidence by encouraging students to interpret ambiguity rather than avoid it. </p>\n\n<h2>How teaching can evolve</h2>\n\n<p>Helping all students develop a sense of initiative and innovation requires university leaders to rethink what success looks like.</p>\n\n<p>Universities can begin with achievable steps, such as rewarding cross-disciplinary teaching and joint appointments in promotion and tenure criteria.</p>\n\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://dsri.uiowa.edu/\">University of Iowa’s Driving Safety Research Institute</a>, where our teams blend engineering, medicine, public health and psychology, students quickly learn that a safe automated vehicle is not just a technical system but also a behavioral one. Understanding how human drivers respond to automation is as important as the algorithms that govern the vehicle. </p>\n\n<p>Other institutions are modeling this approach of integrating social, behavioral and physical sciences.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.olin.edu/\">Olin College of Engineering</a>, a school in Needham, Massachusetts, builds every project around both technical feasibility and human context. Courses are often co-taught by humanities and engineering professors, and projects require students to articulate not only what they built but why it matters.</p>\n\n<p>Still, integrating liberal and technical education is difficult in practice.

Domesticated species are the plants and animals that have evolved to live alongside humans, providing nearly all of our food and numerous other benefits. Dogs provide protection, hunting assistance, companionship, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02184-8\">transportation</a> and even <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mutton-an-indigenous-woolly-dog-died-in-1859-analysis-confirms-precolonial-lineage-of-this-extinct-breed-once-kept-for-their-wool-217868\">wool for weaving blankets</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs evolved from gray wolves, but scientists debate exactly where, when and how many times dogs were domesticated. Ancient DNA evidence suggests that domestication happened twice, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf3161\">in eastern and western Eurasia</a>, before the groups eventually mixed. That blended population was the ancestor of all dogs living today. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://evolution.berkeley.edu/molecular-clocks/\">Molecular clock</a> analysis of the DNA from hundreds of modern and ancient dogs suggests they were domesticated between around 20,000 and 22,000 years ago, when large ice sheets covered much of Eurasia and North America. The <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/14000-year-old-puppy-may-have-been-cared-paleolithic-humans-180968282/\">first dog identified in the archaeological record</a> is a 14,000-year-old pup found in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany, but it can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-024-02134-x\">difficult to tell based on bones</a> whether an animal was an early domestic dog or a wild wolf.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the shared history of dogs and wolves, scientists have long thought these two species rarely mated and gave birth to hybrid offspring. As an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5sYVrEsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">evolutionary biologist</a> and a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G5OGkjUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">molecular anthropologist</a> who study domestic plants and animals, we wanted to take a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2421768122\">new look at whether dog-wolf hybridization</a> has really been all that uncommon.</p>\n\n<h2>Little interbreeding in the wild</h2>\n\n<p>Dogs are not exactly descended from modern wolves. Rather, dogs and wolves living today both derive from a shared ancient wolf population that lived alongside woolly mammoths and cave bears.</p>\n\n<p>In most domesticated species, there are often clear, documented patterns of gene flow between the animals that live alongside humans and their wild counterparts. Where wild and domesticated animals’ habitats overlap, they can breed with each other to produce hybrid offspring. In these cases, the genes from wild animals are folded into the genetic variation of the domesticated population.</p>\n\n<p>For example, pigs were domesticated in the Near East over 10,000 years ago. But when early farmers brought them to Europe, they hybridized so frequently with local wild boar that almost all of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1901169116\">their Near Eastern DNA was replaced</a>. Similar patterns can be seen in the endangered wild Anatolian and Cypriot mouflon that researchers have found to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae090\">high proportions of domestic sheep DNA in their genomes</a>. It’s more common than not to find evidence of wild and domesticated animals interbreeding through time and sharing genetic material.</p>\n\n<p>That wolves and dogs wouldn’t show that typical pattern is surprising, since they live in overlapping ranges and can freely interbreed.</p>\n\n<p>Dog and wolf behavior are completely different, though, with wolves generally organized around a family pack structure and dogs reliant on humans. When hybridization does occur, it tends to be when human activities – such as habitat encroachment and hunting – disrupt pack dynamics, leading female wolves to strike out on their own and breed with male dogs. People intentionally bred <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/czechoslovakian-vlciak/\">a few “wolf dog”</a> <a href=\"https://www.ukcdogs.com/saarloosewolfdog\">hybrid types</a> in the 20th century, but these are considered the exception.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a wolfish looking dog lies on the ground behind a metal fence\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/687971/original/file-20250828-56-ststlh.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Luna Belle, a resident of the Wolf Sanctuary of Pennsylvania, which is home to both wolves and wolf dogs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Audrey Lin</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Tiny but detectable wolf ancestry</h2>\n\n<p>To investigate how much gene flow there really has been between dogs and wolves after domestication, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2421768122\">we analyzed 2,693 previously published genomes</a>, making use of massive <a href=\"https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn/\">publicly available datasets</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These included 146 ancient dogs and wolves covering about 100,000 years. We also looked at 1,872 modern dogs, including golden retrievers, Chihuahuas, malamutes, basenjis and other well-known breeds, plus more unusual breeds from around the world such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Shepherd_Dog\">Caucasian ovcharka</a> and <a href=\"https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/swedish-vallhund.htm\">Swedish vallhund</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we included genomes from about 300 “village dogs.” These are not pets but are free-living animals that are dependent on their close association with human environments.</p>\n\n<p>We traced the evolutionary histories of all of these canids by looking at maternal lineages via their <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/heredity-genetics/Extranuclear-DNA\">mitochondrial genomes</a> and paternal lineages via their Y chromosomes. We used highly sensitive computational methods to dive into the dogs’ and wolves’ <a href=\"https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Medical_genetics/Nuclear_DNA/\">nuclear genomes</a> – that is, the genetic material contained in their cells’ nuclei.</p>\n\n<p>We found the presence of wild wolf genes in most dog genomes and the presence of dog genes in about half of wild wolf genomes. The sign of the wolf was small but it was there, in the form of tiny, almost imperceptible chunks of continuous wolf DNA in dogs’ chromosomes. About two-thirds of breed dogs in our sample had wolf genes from crossbreeding that took place roughly 800 generations ago, on average.</p>\n\n<p>While our results showed that larger, working dogs – such as sled dogs and large guardian dogs that protect livestock – generally have more wolf ancestry, the patterns aren’t universal. Some massive breeds such as the St. Bernard completely lack wolf DNA, but the tiny Chihuahua retains detectable wolf ancestry at 0.2% of its genome. Terriers and scent hounds typically fall at the low end of the spectrum for wolf genes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a dog curled up on the sidewalk in a town\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686752/original/file-20250821-64-ywum8b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A street – or free-ranging – dog in Tbilisi, Georgia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2023-12-24_Samghebro_street,_Tbilisi.jpg\">Alexkom000/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>We were surprised that every single village dog we tested had pieces of wolf DNA in their genomes. Why would this be the case? Village dogs are free-living animals that make up about half the world’s dogs. Their <a href=\"https://worldvet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WVA-FS-on-Free-Roaming-Dogs.pdf\">lives can be tough</a>, with short life expectancy and high infant mortality. Village dogs are also associated with pathogenic diseases, including rabies and canine distemper, making them a public health concern.</p>\n\n<p>More often than predicted by chance, the stretches of wolf DNA we found in village dog genomes contained genes related to olfactory receptors. We imagine that olfactory abilities influenced by wolf genes may have helped these free-living dogs survive in harsh, volatile environments.</p>\n\n<h2>The intertwining of dogs and wolves</h2>\n\n<p>Because dogs evolved from wolves, all of dogs’ DNA is originally wolf DNA. So when we’re talking about the small pieces of wolf DNA in dog genomes, we’re not referring to that original wolf gene pool that’s been kicking around over the past 20,000 years, but rather evidence for dogs and wolves continuing to interbreed much later in time.</p>\n\n<p>A wolf-dog hybrid with one of each kind of parent would carry 50% dog and 50% wolf DNA. If that hybrid then lived and mated with dogs, its offspring would be 25% wolf, and so on, until we see only small snippets of wolf DNA present. </p>\n\n<p>The situation is similar to one in human genomes: Neanderthals and humans share a common ancestor around half a million years ago. However, Neanderthals and our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, also overlapped and interbred in Eurasia as recently as a few thousand generations ago, shortly before Neanderthals disappeared. Scientists can spot the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/our-homo-sapiens-ancestors-shared-the-world-with-neanderthals-denisovans-and-other-types-of-humans-whose-dna-lives-on-in-our-genes-191913\">small pieces of Neanderthal DNA in most living humans</a> in the same way we can see wolf genes within most dogs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"two small tan dogs walking on pavement on a double lead leash\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704286/original/file-20251124-68-sl2prt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Even tiny Chihuahuas contain a little wolf within their doggy DNA.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/chihuahua-dogs-running-on-footpath-royalty-free-image/1463794765\">Westend61 via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Our study updates the previously held belief that hybridization between dogs and wolves is rare; interactions between these two species do have visible genetic traces.

Ever since the Trump administration took power for the second time, it’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-kremlin.html\">alternated between leaning towards Russia</a> in this war or being more neutral, with occasional leaning towards Ukraine. They go back and forth. </p>\n\n<p>This particular peace plan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/world/europe/us-russia-ukraine-peace-plan.html\">gives Russia a lot at once</a>. It gets the size of the Ukrainian army cut down from 800,000-plus to 600,000, when the country is barely hanging on defending itself with 800,000 troops. Russia gets land, including land that it has conquered. A lot of people expected that might be one of the conditions of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. But this also <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251120-the-us-plan-for-ending-the-ukraine-war-what-do-we-know\">gives Russia land that it hasn’t taken yet</a> and may never take. </p>\n\n<p>It bars Ukraine from seeking NATO membership. That’s not a huge surprise. That was probably always going to be part of an eventual deal. Ukraine gets security guarantees from the West. Unfortunately, the U.S. gave <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ukraine-got-a-signed-commitment-in-1994-to-ensure-its-security-but-can-the-us-and-allies-stop-putins-aggression-now-173481\">ironclad security guarantees in 1994</a> when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons voluntarily. It’s been invaded by Russia twice since then, in 2014 and 2022. So our security guarantees really don’t mean a whole lot in that area of the world.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A rescue worker in a uniform stands in front of the rubble of a bombed building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704203/original/file-20251124-56-xpmu5w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Rescue workers extinguish a fire at the site of a Russian drone strike on residential buildings in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 24, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rescue-workers-extinguish-a-fire-at-the-site-of-a-russian-news-photo/2248174347?adppopup=true\">Viacheslav Mavrychev/Suspilne Ukraine/JSC 'UA:PBC'/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>And there’s more, right?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this is the most important part, what Putin is looking for more than anything else. Russia gets <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-kremlin.html\">released from economic sanctions</a> and it rejoins the group of G7 industrialized countries. </p>\n\n<p>Putin’s economy is <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-russias-mounting-economic-woes-could-force-putins-hand/a-74132905\">under a lot of stress</a>. The cash that would flow in for the sale of Russian goods, particularly energy, would enable him to build a whole new army from scratch, if he needed to. That’s a huge strategic advantage. This would be a major shot in the arm for the Russian economy and for the Russian war economy. </p>\n\n<p>So this is a very pro-Russian deal, unless it’s modified heavily, and there’s argument in Washington now whether the Russians just plain drafted it, or whether our State Department drafted it but for some reason leaned heavily towards Russia.</p>\n\n<p>I’m inclined to think the original draft came from the Russians. It’s just too loaded up with the stuff that they want.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>There was a fair amount of confusing back-and-forth on Nov. 23 that Rubio had told some senators that, in fact, the plan wasn’t generated by the United States, that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/politics/us-senators-rounds-rubio-ukraine-peace-plan\">it reflected a Russian wish list</a>. The senators revealed this publicly. Then a State Department spokesman called that claim “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-senators-say-rubio-told-them-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-is-russian-wish-list\">blatantly false</a>.” You’re a former diplomat. When you see that kind of thing happening, what do you think?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s amateur hour. We’ve seen this before. With this administration, it <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/08/19/trump-diplomacy-putin-ukraine-europe/\">puts a lot of very amateurish people</a> – Rubio’s not one of them – in place in important offices, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/09/18/the-education-of-steve-witkoff\">like Steve Witkoff</a>, the special envoy for Russia and Ukraine who is also the special envoy for the Middle East. And they’ve <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/layoffs-diplomats-state-department-trump-rubio-bfdb86767b7bd5b6570819d404a7782e\">gotten rid of all the professionals</a>. They either just fired some or ran some off. </p>\n\n<p>So you know, the problem here is implementation. Politicians can have great thoughts, but they usually then turn to the professionals and say, “Here’s what I’m thinking.” The people they would turn to are gone. And that was their own doing – the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnMlsj6iXVo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">How does having allies help the U.S.?

There are a couple of things that need to happen and aren’t happening very much. First off, this is a war in Eastern Europe. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_2791\">Europe should be very involved</a> now. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/11/20/why-europe-is-sweating-trumps-peace-deal-00664148\">They lean against Russia</a>, so they probably can’t be honest brokers, but they need to be involved in every step of this process. If there’s going to be any rebuilding of Ukraine, <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-solidarity-ukraine/eu-assistance-ukraine/recovery-and-reconstruction-ukraine_en\">Europe’s going to have to help with that</a>. If there’s going to be pressure on Russia, Europe buys a lot of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-and-europe-do-billions-trade-with-russia-despite-sanctions-2025-09-15/\">its goods, especially energy</a>.

Those professionals would then talk to the professionals on the other side or other sides. Staff work would be done, then your presidents or your prime ministers or your secretaries of state would meet and hammer out the deal. </p>\n\n<p>None of that’s happening in this process. People are having great thoughts and getting on planes, and that’s not a recipe for a permanent peace deal.</p>\n\n<p>Europe is champing at the bit to try to get involved in this, because they’ve got professional diplomats still in place, and it affects them. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this happening now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The timing of all this is really interesting. Winter’s coming, and Northern Europe, particularly Germany, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/how-reliant-is-germany-and-europe-russian-gas-nord-stream\">very dependent on Russian natural gas</a> to heat their homes. These sanctions against Russia make that difficult. They make it more expensive. Should Russia decide it wanted to play hardball, it could cut off its natural gas in Northern Europe, and people in Germany would be freezing in the dark this winter. This timing is not an accident.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trump said he wanted an agreement by Thanksgiving. Is that a reasonable requirement of a process to bring peace after a multiyear war?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, it’s not. I don’t know if they even realize this in the\nTrump administration, but that’s another sign – just as we had ahead of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/this-isnt-how-wars-are-ended-a-veteran-diplomat-explains-how-trump-putin-summit-is-amateurish-and-politically-driven-262995\">the Alaska Summit between Putin and Trump</a> – that this isn’t really about trying to make peace. It’s for show and to get credit. In a war that’s been going on now for almost four years, you don’t say, “OK, within the next week, come up with a very complicated peace deal and sign off on it and it’s going to stick.” That’s just not the way it works.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270488/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Donald Heflin does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Or is this simply another technological development that humans will adapt to? </p>\n\n<h2>It isn’t all or nothing</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking about these questions reminded me of Umberto Eco’s essay “Apocalyptic and Integrated,” which was originally written in the early 1960s. Parts of it were later included in an anthology titled “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253318510\">Apocalypse Postponed</a>,” which I first read as a college student in Italy.</p>\n\n<p>In it, Eco draws a contrast between two attitudes toward mass media. There are the “apocalyptics” who fear cultural degradation and moral collapse. Then there are the “integrated” who champion new media technologies as a democratizing force for culture. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"An older man with a beard, glasses and a suit poses while holding a cigarette.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=877&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=877&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=877&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1102&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1102&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703471/original/file-20251119-56-jdz9pi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1102&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Italian philosopher, cultural critic and novelist Umberto Eco cautioned against overreacting to the impact of new technologies.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/eco-umberto-portrait-writer-pordenone-italy-17th-1-01-news-photo/1129597985?adppopup=true\">Leonardo Cendamo/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Back then, Eco was writing about the proliferation of TV and radio.

It isn’t helpful, he wrote, to see new media as either a dire threat or a miracle. Instead, he urged readers to look at how people and communities use these new tools, what risks and opportunities they create, and how they shape – and sometimes reinforce – power structures.</p>\n\n<p>While I was teaching a course on deepfakes during the 2024 election, Eco’s lesson also came back to me. Those were days when <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/faculty_articles/1055/\">some scholars</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ai-deepfakes-top-concern-election-officials-voting-underway/story?id=114202574\">media outlets</a> were regularly warning of an imminent “deepfake apocalypse.” </p>\n\n<p>Would deepfakes be used to mimic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">major political figures</a> and push targeted disinformation? What if, on the eve of an election, generative AI was used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/biden-fake-robocalls-new-hampshire\">to mimic the voice of a candidate</a> on a robocall telling voters to stay home?</p>\n\n<p>Those fears weren’t groundless: Research shows that people <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.107917\">aren’t especially good</a> at identifying deepfakes. At the same time, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103364\">consistently overestimate their ability</a> to do so.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, though, the apocalypse was postponed. Post-election analyses found that deepfakes <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/deepfakes-different-threat-than-expected/\">did seem to intensify some ongoing political trends</a>, such as the erosion of trust and polarization, but there’s <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-apocalypse-that-wasnt-ai-was-everywhere-in-2024s-elections-but-deepfakes-and-misinformation-were-only-part-of-the-picture/\">no evidence that they affected the final outcome of the election</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Listicles, news updates and how-to guides</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, the fears that AI raises for supporters of democracy are not the same as those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/20/more-than-half-of-uk-novelists-believe-ai-will-replace-their-work\">it creates for writers and artists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For them, the core concerns are about authorship: How can one person compete with a system trained on millions of voices that can produce text at hyper-speed? And if this becomes the norm, what will it do to creative work, both as an occupation and as a source of meaning?</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to clarify what’s meant by “online content,” the phrase used in the Graphite study, <a href=\"https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans#methodology\">which analyzed over 65,000 randomly selected articles</a> of at least 100 words on the web. These can include anything from peer-reviewed research to promotional copy for miracle supplements.</p>\n\n<p>A closer reading of the Graphite study shows that the AI-generated articles consist largely of general-interest writing: news updates, how-to guides, lifestyle posts, reviews and product explainers.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"0ZyL5\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0ZyL5/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The primary economic purpose of this content is to persuade or inform, not to express originality or creativity. Put differently, AI appears to be most useful when the writing in question is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/generative-ai-is-most-useful-for-the-things-we-care-about-the-least-249329\">low-stakes and formulaic</a>: the weekend-in-Rome listicle, the standard cover letter, the text produced to market a business.</p>\n\n<p>A whole industry of writers – mostly freelance, including many translators – has relied on precisely this kind of work, producing blog posts, how-to material, search engine optimization text and social media copy. The rapid adoption of large language models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2024.106845\">has already displaced many of the gigs</a> that once sustained them. </p>\n\n<h2>Collaborating with AI</h2>\n\n<p>The dramatic loss of this work points toward another issue raised by the Graphite study: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/gpr0000158\">the question of authenticity</a>, not only in identifying who or what produced a text, but also in understanding the value that humans attach to creative activity. </p>\n\n<p>How can you distinguish a human-written article from a machine-generated one? And does that ability even matter?</p>\n\n<p>Over time, that distinction is likely to grow less significant, particularly as more writing emerges from <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-hybrid-intelligence-is-the-future-of-human-ai-collaboration/\">interactions between humans and AI</a>. A writer might draft a few lines, let an AI expand them and then reshape that output into the final text.</p>\n\n<p>This article is no exception. As a non-native English speaker, I often rely on AI to refine my language before sending drafts to an editor. At times the system attempts to reshape what I mean. But once its stylistic tendencies become familiar, it becomes possible to avoid them and maintain a personal tone.</p>\n\n<p>Also, artificial intelligence is not entirely artificial, since it is trained on human-made material. It’s worth noting that even before AI, human writing has never been entirely human, either. Every technology, from parchment and stylus paper to the typewriter and now AI, has shaped how people write and how readers make sense of it.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point: AI models are increasingly trained on datasets that include not only human writing but also AI-generated and human–AI co-produced text. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922\">This has raised concerns</a> about their ability to continue improving over time. Some commentators have already described a sense of disillusionment following the release of newer large models, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/28/1126687/an-ai-adoption-riddle/\">with companies struggling to deliver on their promises</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Human voices may matter even more</h2>\n\n<p>But what happens when people become overly reliant on AI in their writing? </p>\n\n<p>Some studies show that writers may feel more creative when they use artificial intelligence for brainstorming, yet the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3635636.3656204\">range of ideas often becomes narrower</a>. This uniformity affects style as well: These systems tend to pull users toward <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.13614\">similar patterns of wording</a>, which reduces the differences that usually mark an individual voice. Researchers also note a shift toward Western – and especially English-speaking – norms in the writing of people from other cultures, raising concerns about a new form of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.11360\">AI colonialism</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In this context, texts that display originality, voice and stylistic intention are likely to become even more meaningful within the media landscape, and they may play a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.17493\">crucial role</a> in training the next generations of models.</p>\n\n<p>If you set aside the more apocalyptic scenarios and assume that AI will continue to advance – perhaps at a slower pace than in the recent past – it’s quite possible that thoughtful, original, human-generated writing will become even more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way: The work of writers, journalists and intellectuals will not become superfluous simply because much of the web is no longer written by humans.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268354/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Francesco Agnellini does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

From dashing off a heated text message to composing an op-ed, writing allows you to, at once, name your pain and create distance from it. Writing can shift your mental state from overwhelm and despair to grounded clarity — a shift that reflects resilience.  </p>\n\n<p>Psychology, the media and the wellness industry shape public perceptions of resilience: Social scientists study it, journalists celebrate it, and wellness brands sell it.</p>\n\n<p>They all tell a similar story: Resilience is an individual quality that people can strengthen with effort. The <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience\">American Psychological Association defines resilience</a> as an ongoing process of personal growth through life’s challenges. News headlines routinely praise individuals who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/16/terminal-cancer-diagnosis-palliative-care/\">refuse to give up</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/18/a-memorable-year-readers-reveal-their-silver-linings\">find silver linings</a> in times of hardship. The wellness industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/08/the-self-help-cult-of-resilience-teaches-australians-nothing\">promotes relentless self-improvement</a> as the path to resilience. </p>\n\n<p>In my work as a <a href=\"https://writingstudies.ucmerced.edu/content/emily-r%C3%B3nay-johnston\">professor of writing studies</a>, I research how people use writing to navigate trauma and practice resilience. I have witnessed thousands of students turn to the written word to work through emotions and find a sense of belonging. Their writing habits suggest that writing fosters resilience. Insights from psychology and neuroscience can help explain how. </p>\n\n<h2>Writing rewires the brain</h2>\n\n<p>In the 1980s, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KYOCMe0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">psychologist James Pennebaker</a> developed a therapeutic technique called <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0021-843X.95.3.274\">expressive writing</a> to help patients process trauma and psychological challenges. With this technique, continuously journaling about something painful helps create mental distance from the experience and eases its cognitive load.  </p>\n\n<p>In other words, externalizing emotional distress through writing fosters safety. Expressive writing turns pain into a metaphorical book on a shelf, ready to be reopened with intention. It signals the brain, “You don’t need to carry this anymore.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person sitting at a table writing in a notebook\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701497/original/file-20251110-56-swg06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sometimes you can write your way through difficult emotions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-sits-at-table-writing-in-journal-royalty-free-image/2161883799\">Grace Cary/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Translating emotions and thoughts into words on paper is a <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/blog/psychologically-speaking-your-brain-writing\">complex mental task</a>. It involves retrieving memories and planning what to do with them, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.05.076\">engaging brain areas</a> associated with memory and decision-making. It also involves <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/your-mental-dictionary-is-part-of-what-makes-you-unique-heres-how-your-brain-stores-and-retrieves-words-212751\">putting those memories into language</a>, activating the brain’s visual and motor systems. </p>\n\n<p>Writing things down <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3856\">supports memory consolidation</a> — the brain’s conversion of short-term memories into long-term ones. The process of integration makes it possible for people to reframe painful experiences and manage their emotions. In essence, writing can help free the mind to be in the here and now.  </p>\n\n<h2>Taking action through writing</h2>\n\n<p>The state of presence that writing can elicit is not just an abstract feeling; it reflects complex activity in the nervous system. </p>\n\n<p>Brain imaging studies show that putting feelings into words <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsx084\">helps regulate emotions</a>. Labeling emotions — whether through expletives and emojis or carefully chosen words — has multiple benefits. It calms the amygdala, a cluster of neurons that detects threat and triggers the fear response: <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-to-your-body-during-the-fight-or-flight-response\">fight, flight, freeze or fawn</a>. It also engages the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01132-0\">prefrontal cortex</a>, a part of the brain that supports goal-setting and problem-solving. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the simple act of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.053\">naming your emotions</a> can help you shift from reaction to response. Instead of identifying with your feelings and mistaking them for facts, writing can help you simply become aware of what’s arising and prepare for deliberate action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even mundane writing tasks like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241111-stressed-writing-down-a-to-do-list-might-help\">making a to-do list</a> stimulate parts of the brain involved in reasoning and decision-making, helping you regain focus. </p>\n\n<h2>Making meaning through writing</h2>\n\n<p>Choosing to write is also choosing to make meaning. Studies suggest that having a sense of agency is both a prerequisite for, and an outcome of, writing.  </p>\n\n<p>Researchers have long documented how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jslw.2013.03.004\">writing is a cognitive activity</a> — one that people use to communicate, yes, but also to understand the human experience. As many in the field of writing studies recognize, <a href=\"https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/2705-naming-what-we-know\">writing is a form of thinking</a> — a practice that people never stop learning. With that, writing has the potential to continually reshape the mind. Writing not only expresses but actively creates identity.</p>\n\n<p>Writing also regulates your psychological state. And the words you write are themselves proof of regulation — the evidence of resilience.  </p>\n\n<p>Popular coverage of human resilience often presents it as extraordinary endurance. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5535581/new-orleans-survivors-mental-health-ptsd-hurricane-katrina-resiliency\">News coverage of natural disasters</a> implies that the more severe the trauma, the greater the personal growth. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/personality/resilience-test\">Pop psychology</a> often equates resilience with unwavering optimism. Such representations can obscure ordinary forms of adaptation. Strategies people already use to cope with everyday life — from rage-texting to drafting a resignation letter — signify transformation. </p>\n\n<h2>Building resilience through writing</h2>\n\n<p>These research-backed tips can help you develop a writing practice conducive to resilience: </p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Write by hand whenever possible.</strong> In contrast to typing or tapping on a device, <a href=\"https://laist.com/news/education/why-writing-by-hand-beats-typing-for-thinking-and-learning\">handwriting requires greater cognitive coordination</a>. It slows your thinking, allowing you to process information, form connections and make meaning. </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Write daily.</strong> Start small and make it regular. Even jotting brief notes about your day — what happened, what you’re feeling, what you’re planning or intending — can help you get thoughts out of your head and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2013.802308\">ease rumination</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Write before reacting.</strong> When strong feelings surge, write them down first. Keep a notebook within reach and make it a habit to write it before you say it. Doing so can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2013.04.002\">support reflective thinking</a>, helping you act with purpose and clarity. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Write a letter you never send.</strong> Don’t just write down your feelings — address them to the person or situation that’s troubling you. Even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-023-02097-5\">writing a letter to yourself</a> can provide a safe space for release without the pressure of someone else’s reaction.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Treat writing as a process.</strong> Any time you draft something and ask for feedback on it, you practice stepping back to consider alternative perspectives. Applying that feedback through revision can <a href=\"https://krieger.jhu.edu/writing-program/writing-toolkit/concepts-and-practices/writing-for-metacognition/\">strengthen self-awareness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/16/01/its-good-lets-make-it-great#\">build confidence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Resilience may be as ordinary as the journal entries people scribble, the emails they exchange, the task lists they create — even the essays students pound out for professors. </p>\n\n<p>The act of writing is adaptation in progress.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265188/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Emily Johnston receives funding from the Andrew W.

It was March, right before morel mushrooms emerge in central Pennsylvania. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn’t doing a lot other than going on long hikes and taking classes remotely at Penn State for my <a href=\"https://anth.la.psu.edu/people/acw208/\">doctoral degree in ecology and anthropology</a>. One of the classes was an agroforestry class with <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c10MY50AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Eric Burkhart</a>. We studied how agriculture and forests benefit people and the environment. </p>\n\n<p>These two things eventually led to a <a href=\"https://acw208.wixsite.com/mushroom-hunting-in\">yearslong project on mushroom harvesting</a> in our region. </p>\n\n<h2>Why people forage</h2>\n\n<p>Foragers have been harvesting wild mushrooms in what is now Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S. mid-Atlantic region <a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article-abstract/6/2/49/47266/Molly-Mooching-on-Bradley-Mountain-The-Aesthetic\">for generations</a>, but the extent and specifics of the practice in the region had not been formally studied. </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, Burkhart and I decided that we wanted to better understand the variety of wild mushroom species that Pennsylvania harvesters collect and what they use them for.</p>\n\n<p>We conducted a series of surveys in 2022 and 2023 that revealed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12231-025-09651-3\">wide variety of fungi are foraged in the region</a> – though morels, chicken of the woods and chanterelles are most common. We also learned that harvesters use the mushrooms primarily for food and medicinal purposes, and that foragers create communities that share knowledge. These community based projects often use social media tools as a way for mushroom harvesters to share pictures, notes and even the results of DNA sequences. </p>\n\n<p>Our findings were published in the journal Economic Botany in October 2025.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DRA4JL7jROy&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>160 species</h2>\n\n<p>Having spent a year building connections with local mushroom harvesters, starting in central Pennsylvania, including members of <a href=\"https://wpamushroomclub.org/\">mushroom clubs</a> and <a href=\"https://phillymycoclub.com/\">mycological associations</a>, we recruited a diverse group of harvesters from around the mid-Atlantic. We also used mushroom festivals, social media and word of mouth to get the word out.</p>\n\n<p>We asked harvesters about their favorite mushrooms, common harvesting practices, resources they used while harvesting and any sustainability practices.</p>\n\n<p>Over 800 harvesters responded to the survey and reported that, collectively, they foraged 160 species of wild mushrooms. Morels and chicken of the woods were the two most popular, as each were reported by 13% of respondents. About 10% of respondents reported collecting chanterelles. Other popular species were hen of the woods, oysters, lion’s mane, black trumpet, honey mushroom, turkey tail, bolete, reishi, puffball, chaga, shrimp of the woods and Dryad’s saddle, which is also known as the pheasant’s back mushroom.</p>\n\n<p>Harvesters reported a variety of reasons for collecting mushrooms. Many collected morels and chanterelle to eat, and species such as turkey tail, reishi and chaga for medicinal purposes. Art was another common reason cited for foraging, with photography being the most popular use, followed by using mushrooms to create natural dyes and pigments. </p>\n\n<p>Other survey respondents said they foraged to feel more connected to nature. And while there is a thriving commercial wild mushroom industry in the region, we found that only a small minority of harvesters sell their mushrooms. Most people reported giving their mushrooms to friends, neighbors and family.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Person holds basket of mushrooms as another person places a mushroom inside of it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703220/original/file-20251118-56-13nj8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Mushroom foraging can be a way for people to connect with nature.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/basket-of-mushrooms-is-held-by-two-people-royalty-free-image/2180789201\">Natalia Lebedinskaia/Moment Collection via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Citizen science</h2>\n\n<p>We also wanted to better understand which resources mushroom harvesters turn to in order to learn more about this hobby. We asked all the harvesters what they used as a resource when they were first learning to hunt for mushrooms. A quarter of new harvesters said they used the “the internet,” followed by “family,” at 24%, and then guide books, at 20%.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the survey responses, we also learned that mushroom-identification phone apps are growing in popularity, especially among new harvesters. For example, a commonly used app called <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org\">iNaturalist</a> allows harvesters to upload a few pictures of their find – one of the mushroom in its habitat, another of the underside of the cap, and a third of the entire mushroom. From there, other community members can comment and help with identification. </p>\n\n<p>Harvesters also use these apps to contribute to <a href=\"https://wpamushroomclub.org/education/introduction-dna-barcoding/wpmc-dna-barcoding-project/\">community science projects</a> that document biodiversity.</p>\n\n<p>Some mushrooms are poisonous if eaten, which is part of why harvesters are so careful with their identification. When learning a new mushroom species, it’s important to look into multiple sources to make sure what you’re harvesting is safe to eat.</p>\n\n<p>With more harvesters documenting their findings on social media and sharing information about fungal biodiversity in the region, there is much to glean and learn about the diverse world of mushrooms in the mid-Atlantic. We believe that deeper collaboration between community groups and researchers at universities and other institutions is an opportunity for scientific growth within the field of mycology. This collaboration can support long-term tracking of fungal populations and any impact that harvesters might have on them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A wild mushroom growing out of the side of a tree trunk\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703223/original/file-20251118-56-rz74s7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chicken of the woods mushrooms are among the most commonly foraged.

But these dreams hinge on one critical challenge: propulsion – the methods used to push rockets and spacecraft forward. </p>\n\n<p>To make interplanetary travel faster, safer and more efficient, scientists need breakthroughs in propulsion technology. <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial intelligence</a> is one type of technology that has begun to provide some of these necessary breakthroughs.</p>\n\n<p>We’re a team of <a href=\"https://campus.und.edu/directory/marcos.fernandeztous\">engineers and graduate students</a> who are studying how AI in general, and a subset of AI called <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained\">machine learning</a> in particular, can transform spacecraft propulsion. From optimizing <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/6-things-you-should-know-about-nuclear-thermal-propulsion\">nuclear thermal engines</a> to managing complex <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04301-9\">plasma confinement in fusion systems</a>, AI is reshaping propulsion design and operations. It is quickly becoming an indispensable partner in humankind’s journey to the stars.</p>\n\n<h2>Machine learning and reinforcement learning</h2>\n\n<p>Machine learning is a branch of AI that identifies patterns in data that it has not explicitly been trained on. It is a vast field <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning-types\">with its own branches</a>, with a lot of applications. Each branch emulates intelligence in different ways: by recognizing patterns, parsing and generating language, or learning from experience. This last subset in particular, commonly known as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-reinforcement-learning-an-ai-researcher-explains-a-key-method-of-teaching-machines-and-how-it-relates-to-training-your-dog-251887\">reinforcement learning</a>, teaches machines to perform their tasks by rating their performance, enabling them to continuously improve through experience. </p>\n\n<p>As a simple example, imagine a chess player. The player does not calculate every move but rather recognizes patterns from playing a thousand matches. Reinforcement learning creates similar intuitive expertise in machines and systems, but at a computational speed and scale impossible for humans. It learns through experiences and iterations <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-dummies/\">by observing its environment</a>. These observations allows the machine to correctly interpret each outcome and deploy the best strategies for the system to reach its goal.</p>\n\n<p>Reinforcement learning can improve human understanding of deeply complex systems – those that challenge the limits of human intuition. It can help determine the most <a href=\"https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4537&amp;context=dissertations\">efficient trajectory for a spacecraft</a> heading anywhere in space, and it does so by optimizing the propulsion necessary to send the craft there. It can also potentially <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s44205-024-00077-y\">design better propulsion systems</a>, from selecting the best materials to coming up with configurations that transfer heat between parts in the engine more efficiently. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIgIv4IfJ6s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In reinforcement learning, you can train an AI model to complete tasks that are too complex for humans to complete themselves.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Reinforcement learning for propulsion systems</h2>\n\n<p>In regard to space propulsion, reinforcement learning generally falls into two categories: those that assist during the design phase – when engineers define mission needs and system capabilities – and those that support <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2022.07.004\">real-time operation</a> once the spacecraft is in flight.</p>\n\n<p>Among the most exotic and promising propulsion concepts is nuclear propulsion, which harnesses the same forces that power atomic bombs and fuel the Sun: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/fission-and-fusion-what-difference\">nuclear fission and nuclear fusion</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsnuclear-fission\">Fission works by splitting heavy atoms</a> such as uranium or plutonium to release energy – a principle used in most terrestrial nuclear reactors.

Because the more efficiently a reactor can transfer heat from the fuel to the hydrogen, the more thrust it generates.</p>\n\n<p>This area is where reinforcement learning has proved to be essential. Optimizing the geometry and heat flow between fuel and propellant is a complex problem, involving countless variables – from the material properties to the amount of hydrogen that flows across the reactor at any given moment. Reinforcement learning can analyze these design variations and identify configurations that maximize <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/jne5030015\">heat transfer</a>. Imagine it as a smart thermostat but for a rocket engine – one you definitely don’t want to stand too close to, given the extreme temperatures involved.</p>\n\n<h2>Reinforcement learning and fusion technology</h2>\n\n<p>Reinforcement learning also plays a key role in developing nuclear fusion technology. Large-scale experiments such as the <a href=\"https://www.jt60sa.org/wp/\">JT-60SA tokamak</a> in Japan are pushing the boundaries of fusion energy, but their massive size makes them impractical for spaceflight. That’s why researchers are exploring <a href=\"https://www.emc2fusion.com/technology/technology\">compact designs such as polywells</a>. These exotic devices look like hollow cubes, about a few inches across, and they confine plasma in magnetic fields to create the conditions necessary for fusion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06761\">Controlling magnetic fields</a> within a polywell is no small feat. The magnetic fields must be strong enough to keep hydrogen atoms bouncing around until they fuse – a process that demands immense energy to start but can become self-sustaining once underway. Overcoming this challenge is necessary for scaling this technology for nuclear thermal propulsion. </p>\n\n<h2>Reinforcement learning and energy generation</h2>\n\n<p>However, reinforcement learning’s role doesn’t end with design. It can help manage fuel consumption – a critical task for missions that must adapt on the fly. In today’s space industry, there’s growing interest in spacecraft that can serve different roles depending on the mission’s needs and how they adapt to priority changes through time.</p>\n\n<p>Military applications, for instance, must respond rapidly to shifting geopolitical scenarios. An example of a technology adapted to fast changes is <a href=\"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/lm400.html\">Lockheed Martin’s LM400</a> satellite, which has varied capabilities such as missile warning or remote sensing.</p>\n\n<p>But this flexibility introduces uncertainty. How much fuel will a mission require? And when will it need it? Reinforcement learning can help with these calculations. </p>\n\n<p>From bicycles to rockets, learning through experience – whether human or machine – is shaping the future of space exploration. As scientists push the boundaries of propulsion and intelligence, AI is playing a growing role in space travel. It may help scientists explore within and beyond our solar system and open the gates for new discoveries.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268643/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sreejith Vidhyadharan Nair receives funding from the University of North Dakota.

The universe and the stuff within might once again change, like it has in the past.</p>\n\n<h2>How will stars change in the future?</h2>\n\n<p>Good news: The Sun, our medium-sized yellow star, is going to continue shining for billions of years. It’s about halfway through its <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-age/en/\">10 billion-year lifetime</a>. The lifetime of a star depends on its size. Big, hot, blue stars live shorter lives, while tiny, cool, red stars <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/m/main+sequence+lifetime\">live for much longer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, some galaxies are still producing new stars, but others have depleted their star-forming gas. When a galaxy stops forming stars, the blue stars quickly <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainssupernovae\">go “supernova” and disappear</a>, exploding after only a few million years. Then, billions of years later, the yellow stars like the Sun eject their outer layers <a href=\"https://www.space.com/nebula-definition-types\">into a nebula</a>, leaving only the red stars puttering along. Eventually, all galaxies throughout the universe will stop producing new stars, and the starlight filling the universe will gradually redden and dim.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An illustration of a red dwarf star and a nearby planet\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702013/original/file-20251112-56-y69l85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Red dwarf stars are the longest-lived type of stars.

Each bucket of sand makes the castle bigger and bigger. Galaxies grow over time in a similar way by <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/galaxies-merging-and-interacting\">eating up smaller galaxies</a>. These galactic mergers will continue into the future.</p>\n\n<p>In galaxy clusters, hundreds of galaxies fall inward toward their shared center, often resulting in messy collisions. In these mergers, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/types/\">spiral galaxies</a>, which are orderly disks, combine in chaotic ways into disordered blob-shaped clouds of stars. Think of how easy it is to turn a well-constructed sand castle into a big mess by kicking it over.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, the universe over time will have fewer spiral galaxies and more elliptical galaxies because the spiral galaxies combine into elliptical galaxies.</p>\n\n<p>The Milky Way galaxy and the neighboring <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-31/\">Andromeda galaxy</a> might combine in this way in a few billion years. Don’t worry: The stars in each galaxy would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision\">whiz past each other totally unharmed</a>, and future stargazers would get a fantastic view of the two galaxies merging.</p>\n\n<h2>How will the universe itself change in the future?</h2>\n\n<p>The Big Bang kick-started an expansion that probably will continue in the future. The gravity of all the stuff in the universe – stars, galaxies, gas, dark matter – pulls inward and slows down the expansion, and some theories suggest that the universe’s expansion <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-universes-expansion-may-be-slowing-down-not-speeding-up-new-research-suggests-180987660/\">will coast along or slow to a halt</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, some evidence suggests that some unknown force is starting to exert a repulsive force, causing expansion to speed up.

Each group or cluster of galaxies will merge into a single, massive, elliptical galaxy. The accelerated expansion of the universe will make it impossible to observe other galaxies beyond the local group. </p>\n\n<p>This scenario eventually winds down into a dark eternity, lasting trillions of years. New data might come to light that changes this story, and the next stage in the universe’s history might be something totally different and unexpectedly beautiful. Depending on how you look at it, the universe might not have an “end,” after all. Even if what exists is very different from how the universe is now, it’s hard to envision a distant future where the universe is entirely gone.</p>\n\n<p>How does this scenario make you feel? It sometimes makes me feel wistful, which is a type of sadness, but then I remember we live at a very exciting time in the story of the universe: right at the start, in an era full of exciting stars and galaxies to observe!

News media outlets just aren’t as important these days for advertisers when they can reach potential customers so many other ways, including through social media. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/the-new-york-times-made-more-than-1-billion-from-digital-subscriptions-in-2023/\">Some news outlets</a> are relying more on subscription revenue. But that can also be a tough sell when readers have so many alternatives – often free – for finding news, <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/people-are-turning-away-news-heres-why-it-may-be-happening\">if they’re even looking for it</a> at all.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, <a href=\"https://inn.org/research/inn-index/2025-index/coverage-quality/\">local news media outlets are adopting nonprofit models</a> to be able to obtain grants from foundations and donations from individuals as new revenue sources.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, some nonprofit news leaders have avoided selling ads because <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/advertising-unrelated-business-taxable-income-and-3rd-party-contractor-issues\">the IRS has said</a> their organizations would have to pay taxes on that revenue. They have also heard that selling too many ads <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/The%20impact%20of%20charity%20and%20tax%20law%20regulation%20on%20not%20for%20profit%20news%20organisations.pdf\">might jeopardize their tax-exempt status altogether</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iswne.org/grassroots_editor/\">My research suggests that they need not worry about that</a> – although, given recent threats by the Trump administration against <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status-international-students-07a10958bf078cb04b59d1fc9a3a27a8\">Harvard University</a> and other nonprofits, they may have reasons to be wary.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Encouraging earned revenue</h2>\n\n<p>I’m a former public radio journalist who now <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E4maWVsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">researches the nonprofit news sector</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I interviewed 23 nonprofit news leaders in 2023 about their fundraising practices. I also reviewed hundreds of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019\">990 forms</a> that most nonprofits are required to file annually with the IRS.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2025, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nonprofit-news-media-leaders-are-struggling-to-stop-leaning-on-the-foundations-that-say-they-should-branch-out-more-255821\">I published a study</a> that found most nonprofit news leaders still depended heavily on foundations and individual donors. That’s despite calls from foundations and the Institute for Nonprofit News, an organization representing these media outlets, that they should diversify their revenue sources.</p>\n\n<p>The Institute for Nonprofit News especially encourages news nonprofits to consider adding <a href=\"https://inn.org/research/guides/the-nonprofit-news-guide-to-earned-revenue/\">earned revenue</a>. That category can include lots of things, but <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2021-november/unrelated-business-income-tax/\">most often it means selling ads</a>. The nonprofit news leaders I spoke with had mixed feelings about that.</p>\n\n<h2>Taxing unrelated business income</h2>\n\n<p>The philanthropic dollars that charitable nonprofits get from foundations, individual donors and corporations are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c3-organizations.asp\">exempt from taxes</a>. But their earned revenue from sources such as advertising, sponsorships or ticketed events is often taxable.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because U.S. tax law requires nonprofits to pay taxes on income deemed to be “<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax\">not substantially related</a>” to their public service missions.</p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, money that a nonprofit museum earns through its gift shop. The government <a href=\"https://www.501c3.org/nonprofit-unrelated-business-income/\">taxes that as unrelated business income</a> so nonprofits don’t get an unfair edge over their for-profit competitors.</p>\n\n<p>Money raised through ad sales has also historically counted as unrelated business income for nonprofits, according to the IRS. Some nonprofit news leaders say that’s not how it should be.</p>\n\n<p>Some news nonprofits are directly challenging the traditional classification of advertising revenue as unrelated business income.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the San Antonio Report, a nonprofit news outlet, <a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/474820476_202212_990_2024010522181634.pdf\">reported receiving US$361,649 in advertising revenue in tax year 2022</a>. But the organization did not pay taxes on it, because it identifies advertising as part of its mission. In fact, a Supreme Court ruling in the 1986 United States v. American College of Physicians case left open the possibility that advertising could be a tax-exempt form of revenue if it had an “<a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/475/834/\">educational function</a>” related to the nonprofit’s purpose.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Someone writes using a laptop in a hazy photo.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703950/original/file-20251121-56-ifhbv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nonprofit news outlets need revenue, and their donors want them to find new sources of it.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/man-working-online-at-home-on-his-laptop-computer-royalty-free-image/1460688324?adppopup=true\">Maria Korneeva/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Selling ads anyway</h2>\n\n<p>Nonprofit news leaders not trying to challenge that classification still had reason to be concerned about running paid ads.</p>\n\n<p>The IRS has warned it could revoke the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that had too much unrelated business income in their portfolios. That’s one of the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/How%20to%20Lose%20Your%20Tax%20Exempt%20Status.pdf\">top six reasons organizations lose their nonprofit status</a>, according to the IRS. Other reasons include failure to serve an exempt purpose, lobbying, political campaigning, mission drift and failure to complete annual 990 forms.</p>\n\n<p>How much unrelated business income is too much? The IRS has not provided clear guidance on this, <a href=\"https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/solutions/removing-irs-obstacles-to-nonprofit-news/\">despite pleas from local nonprofit news advocates</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One editor I interviewed, whose free weekly newspaper had recently converted from a for-profit enterprise to a nonprofit, lamented that her copious ad portfolio could put her tax-exempt status in jeopardy. Ads had always been part of what readers appreciated about her newspaper, she said – it was how they learned about restaurants and nightlife.</p>\n\n<p>Some tax advisers recommend that nonprofits keep unrelated business income <a href=\"https://law.richmond.edu/faculty/files/HowToFormANonprofit_1st_ed-Chapter3.pdf\">below 25% of their total revenue</a>. But the ambiguity is enough to make some nonprofit news leaders prefer to not get any at all.</p>\n\n<p>Some local news nonprofits are selling ads, despite their reservations about the potential tax impact and the potential threat of the <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2025-may/how-irs-revoke-federal-tax-exempt-status/\">IRS revoking their tax-exempt status</a>. Of the Institute for Nonprofit News’ roughly 201 local newsroom members, 21 reported earning at least $1,000 in unrelated business income in the most recent year for which data was available when I conducted these interviews – usually 2022 or 2023. That happens to be the <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/ubti\">minimum reportable amount</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Paying no taxes</h2>\n\n<p>Only three of these 21 local news nonprofits paid taxes on their advertising revenue – and the ones that paid did so at reduced amounts. The outlets were largely able to avoid taxes due to exemptions <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicg82.pdf\">the IRS allows nonprofits to claim</a> for advertising-related expenses, such as commissions, agency fees and production. Several news nonprofits were also able to deduct readership costs, such as printing and distribution. </p>\n\n<p>Local news nonprofits also appeared not to draw the ire of the IRS for accepting too much advertising revenue. While most reported unrelated business income that amounted to less than 25% of their total revenue, five news nonprofits did exceed that percentage, sometimes by quite a bit.</p>\n\n<h2>Rarely revoking tax exemptions</h2>\n\n<p>It turns out the IRS rarely revokes the tax-exempt status of charitable nonprofits of any kind for collecting too much unrelated business income.</p>\n\n<p>IRS records indicate that the most common reason for revocations was the failure of nonprofits to file their 990 forms annually.</p>\n\n<p>Not doing so for three years in a row <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/automatic-revocation-of-exemption-for-nonfiling-overview\">triggers an automatic revocation</a>, which can be reversed if nonprofits get back into compliance by belatedly filing their overdue paperwork. Revocations for all other reasons, including excessive unrelated business income, have impacted less than 0.1% of nonprofits, according to my analysis of IRS records.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, two common concerns about advertising expressed by the nonprofit news leaders I interviewed – the potential tax burden and the risk of running afoul of the IRS – appear to have been unfounded.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, it can be hard to keep up with what might run afoul of IRS rules. </p>\n\n<p>Starting in April 2025, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status-international-students-07a10958bf078cb04b59d1fc9a3a27a8\">threatened to revoke the nonprofit status</a> of Harvard University after its leaders resisted numerous demands, including changes to its leadership and admissions policies.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofit news organizations have also faced pressure from the Trump administration. Several public media outlets are planning to shut down or reduce their operations following the <a href=\"https://cpb.org/pressroom/corporation-public-broadcasting-addresses-operations-following-loss-federal-funding\">Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s loss of government funding</a> in 2025. It’s part of what’s widely seen as the administration’s attempt to control news media, a campaign that has also led to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/16/trump-new-york-times/86177814007/\">defamation lawsuits</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/feature/paramount-trump-lawsuit-settlement-skydance-merger-press-freedom.php\">leadership shakeup at CBS News</a>, and the Federal Communications Commission’s <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/brendan-carr-fcc-deregulation-blitz-is-a-disaster-for-tv-news.php\">deregulation efforts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So far, Harvard’s nonprofit status remains intact, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-trump-strip-harvard-of-its-charitable-status-scholars-of-nonprofit-law-and-accounting-describe-the-obstacles-in-his-way-255072\">legal experts say it’s likely to stay that way</a>. Still, at a time when many local news nonprofits are struggling to keep the lights on, I can understand why they might choose to tread lightly.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. is a member of the Institute for Nonprofit News and does not get any revenue from advertising.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268844/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Katherine Fink does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Kennedy Jr.’s accounts of “Operation Northwoods.” Something that explains the origins of <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf\">this menu of false flag operations</a> – pretexts for war with Cuba – drafted by the Pentagon in March 1962. </p>\n\n<p>Something about his father.</p>\n\n<p>Most people remember Robert F. Kennedy as President John F. Kennedy’s <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1120.html\">closest confidant, campaign manager and attorney general</a>, the tough but idealistic younger brother who helped him through the Cuban missile crisis and later waged an antiwar campaign for president, before becoming the second Kennedy brother <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/assassination-robert-kennedy\">slain by an assassin</a>. </p>\n\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5188411/robert-kennedy-trump-administration-health\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s political rise to his current position</a> as Secretary of Health and Human Services, he capitalized on the story of “Operation Northwoods,” giving <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849531763326095545\">his version of it in</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/20/anti-vaccine-mandate-robert-f-kennedy-jr-march-washington-children-health-defense/\">speeches</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GrahamWardle/status/1646405769481588737\">interviews</a>, and two <a href=\"https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781510766808/the-real-anthony-fauci/\">separate</a> <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/american-values-robert-f-kennedy?variant=40079999533090\">books</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Kennedy Jr. pinned the blame for the pretexts solely on “the highest officials in the U.S. military,” accusing them of “lethal zealotry,” decrying “how badly the American military leadership had <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/american-values-robert-f-kennedy?variant=40079999533090\">lost its moral bearings</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate the point, he cited one pretext at length: “A <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/remember-the-maine-56071873/\">‘Remember the Maine’</a> incident could be arranged in several forms: We could blow up a U.S. ship in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/5-things-to-know-about-guantanamo-bay-on-its-115th-birthday-108301\">Guantánamo Bay</a> and blame Cuba.” </p>\n\n<p>In each of these accounts, Kennedy Jr. omitted the most important part of the “Operation Northwoods” story: his father’s role. I learned of that role from documents declassified by the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/review-board\">JFK Assassination Records Review Board</a>, in the <a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/\">Kennedy Library</a> and in other archives while researching a book I’m writing, “Clandestine Camelot.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A bearded man at a lectern with a raised arm and speaking into multiple microphones.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=353&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=353&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=353&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703883/original/file-20251121-62-2cmesh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Robert F.

Roughly 1,500 CIA-trained and -financed Cuban expatriates were mounting a doomed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary-turned-tyrant. Castro had the invaders pinned down on the beach under fire from Moscow-furnished MiG fighter jets.</p>\n\n<p>It was then that the attorney general asked the president if they could get Central and South American nations “to take some action” to stop the flow of Russian arms to Cuba “if it was reported that one or two of Castro’s MiGs attacked Guantanamo Bay and the United States made noises like this was an act of war and that we might very well have to <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d157\">take armed action ourselves</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Castro, of course, had not attacked the U.S. naval base. That would have meant war with America and the end of his regime.</p>\n\n<p>President Kennedy didn’t act on his brother’s suggestion, but began including him regularly in foreign policymaking. Newspapers started calling RFK “the <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-los-angeles-times-robert-f-kennedy/162702900/\">second most important man</a> in the Western World.”</p>\n\n<h2>From subversion to military intervention</h2>\n\n<p>During the 1960 presidential campaign, JFK called Cuba a “<a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/text-telephone-address-senator-john-f-kennedy-amvet-convention-miami-beach-fl\">Soviet satellite</a>” and a “<a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/cincinnati-oh-19601006-democratic-dinner\">potential enemy missile or submarine base</a> only 90 miles from our shores.” In November 1961, hoping to undo the Bay of Pigs failure, he created his own covert operation “to help Cuba <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d278\">overthrow the communist regime</a>.” He put his <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10-12mSupp/d277\">brother Robert in charge</a> of the secret program of subversion, code-named “Operation Mongoose.”</p>\n\n<p>Fomenting revolution in Cuba faced an insurmountable obstacle: Castro was already powerful enough to crush any purely internal uprising. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d271\">CIA</a>, <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d305\">State Department</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32424904.pdf\">Defense</a> Department officials agreed that the only way to overthrow Castro was a U.S. invasion. </p>\n\n<p>Under Robert Kennedy’s leadership, the “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Alleged_Assassination_Plots_Involving_Fo/gONCAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22A%20new%20control%20group,%20the%20Special%20Group%20(Augmented)%20(SGA)%20was%22&amp;pg=PA140&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Special Group (Augmented)</a>,” the interagency group JFK charged with overseeing Mongoose, proposed to change the covert operation’s goal from orchestrating subversion to justifying U.S. military intervention. </p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305084?objectPage=3\">March 5, 1962</a>, the group asked Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs U. Alexis Johnson “to have a list prepared of various situations which would serve as a <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305084?objectPage=4\">plausible pretext for intervention</a>.” In the minutes of that meeting, someone crossed out “plausible pretext” and wrote “valid basis.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703866/original/file-20251121-56-palxgk.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A page of minutes from a meeting show that Robert F.

Lansdale asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff for “a <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305069?objectPage=3\">brief but precise description of pretexts</a> which the JCS believes desirable for direct military intervention.”</p>\n\n<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff responded by drafting the document now known as “Operation Northwoods.” </p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: No one called it “Operation Northwoods” at the time. </p>\n\n<p>“Northwoods” was just a code word the Joint Chiefs of Staff used on Mongoose documents. In the 21st century, however, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24486204\">historians</a> <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-commercial-appeal-book-says-us-pla/185145117/\">mistook</a> the code word for a code name and gave the pretexts their unhistorical handle. There was no “Operation Northwoods,” but that didn’t stop it from getting its own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Special Group (Augmented) voted on <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2018/157-10014-10238.pdf\">March 13, 1962</a>, to alter the Mongoose guidelines to state “that final success will require decisive <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d314\">U.S. military intervention</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Three days later, the group briefed the president on the revised guidelines, including secret “<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/bayofpigs/19620316.pdf\">plans for creating plausible pretexts to use force</a>, with the pretexts either attacks on U.S. aircraft or a Cuban action in Latin America for which we would retaliate.” </p>\n\n<p>President Kennedy said “<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/bayofpigs/19620316.pdf\">bluntly</a>” that they were not then able to make a decision on the use of military force.</p>\n\n<p>But he did tell the group to “go ahead on the guidelines.” Since the revised guidelines said that Cubans “will be used to <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10/d314\">prepare for and justify this [U.S. military] intervention</a>, and thereafter to facilitate and support it,” the revision transformed Mongoose into a secret program to furnish the president with a pretext to invade Cuba if he so chose. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, he didn’t.</p>\n\n<h2>Apocalyptic advice</h2>\n\n<p>The last recorded time Robert Kennedy urged his brother to consider a false flag operation was on Oct. 16, 1962, the first day of the <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/the-cuban-missile-crisis/\">Cuban missile crisis</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s secret White House recording system captured Robert Kennedy advising him to consider fabricating a pretext for U.S military intervention: “Can I say that one other thing is whether we should also think of whether there is some other way we can get involved in this, through Guantánamo Bay or something. Or whether there’s some ship that … you know, <a href=\"https://prde.upress.virginia.edu/conversations/8020045\">sink the Maine again</a> or something.” </p>\n\n<p>JFK ignored the suggestion. Taking it would have, in all likelihood, <a href=\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/history/nuclear-close-calls-cuban-missile-crisis/\">started a nuclear war</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This year marks <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/president/kennedy/essays/kennedy-1961-attorney-general\">the centennial of Robert Kennedy’s birth</a>, the perfect occasion to stop scapegoating the military for his darkest deeds. In drafting pretexts for war, the Pentagon was complying with instructions it received through the command structure the president established for Operation Mongoose. Generals have little choice but to comply with such instructions unless and until Congress outlaws false flag operations.</p>\n\n<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote that the “Operation Northwoods memo should serve as a warning [to] the American people about the dangers of allowing the military to set goals or standards for our country.” </p>\n\n<p>In reality, it reveals the dangers of letting someone like Robert F. Kennedy use the power of the U.S. government to deceive Americans about life-or-death matters.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270205/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ken Hughes is a research specialist with the Presidential Recordings Program of the University of Virginia&#39;s Miller Center, whose work is funded in part by grants from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.</span></em></p>",

The trajectory from the 1940s until today shows a fundamental shift: from defined organizational structures that could be dismantled to diffuse cultural movements that spread through social media.</p>\n\n<p>Let me offer an example. </p>\n\n<p>In 1946, barely a year after Hitler’s defeat, young men in khaki shirts marched through Atlanta, Georgia, performing Nazi salutes and promising racial vengeance. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/article/new-and-spectacular-hate-organization\">Led by Homer Loomis Jr.</a> – a Princeton dropout who called Hitler’s manifesto “<a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/mein-kampf\">Mein Kampf</a>” his “bible” – this group, known as the Columbians, offered Atlanta a glimpse of explicit fascism. They conducted armed patrols, held uniformed drills and even drew up blueprints for blowing up City Hall. </p>\n\n<p>Their brazenness, however, was matched by their brevity. Ten months after forming, Atlanta authorities revoked their charter and jailed the ringleaders.</p>\n\n<p>The swift suppression seemed to prove that explicit fascism had no future in postwar America. And for decades that held true. Open Nazi sympathizers remained marginal, their organizations small and easily ostracized. </p>\n\n<p>In the 1970s, when a group of <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/the-skokie-case-how-i-came-to-represent-the-free-speech-rights-of-nazis\">American Nazis</a> planned to march in Skokie, Illinois, a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago, the event was most notable for the counterprotests it triggered.</p>\n\n<h2>Mainstreaming fascism</h2>\n\n<p>But the Columbians’ failure, it turned out, was organizational, not ideological. The government could revoke a charter and convict leaders. They could not repress a mood.</p>\n\n<p>In the digital age, Fuentes represents that mood as a diffuse sensibility rather than a structured organization. Where the Columbians wore uniforms that advertised their fascist allegiance, Fuentes wears suits and frames his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">worldview in the rhetoric of “America First</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>The difference is strategic. In a 2019 livestream, Fuentes explained his approach openly: “Bit by bit we start to break down these walls … and then one day, we become the mainstream.”</p>\n\n<p>This packaging marks a deliberate shift. Fuentes treats plausible deniability – of fascism, of antisemitism – not as a weakness but as a central feature.

A tone of grievance and ironic provocation becomes prominent background noise, moving the marginal toward the mainstream. A generation raised on anti-woke content, 4chan and transgressive memes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">now shapes the neofascist movement’s tone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, institutional authority has in many ways effectively collapsed.

Roberts has apologized for some of its contents but not retracted it.</p>\n\n<p>Republicans aren’t all in agreement about whether Groypers represent a threat or an important constituency. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">Members of Congress</a> have given speeches at Fuentes’ conferences; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/trump-nick-fuentes-dinner.html\">Trump dined with him</a> at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4822598-jd-vance-disavows-nick-fuentes-a-total-loser/\">JD Vance</a>, now the vice president, called Fuentes a “total loser.” Fuentes attempted, without success, to mobilize Groypers against Trump in 2024 and called the president a “<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/198088/donald-trump-neo-nazi-nick-fuentes-epstein\">scam artist</a>” earlier this year for failing to release the files in the Jeffrey Epstein case. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the broader Groyperfication of conservative youth culture proceeds apace. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/trump-epstein-republicans-vote.html\">reversed his stance</a> on the Epstein files. In defending Carlson’s interview with Fuentes, Trump said, “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-defends-tucker-carlson-after-interview-with-nick-fuentes-far-right-activist-known-for-his-antisemitic-views\">I don’t know much about him</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump said roughly the same thing when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/trump-nick-fuentes-dinner.html\">sat down to dinner with Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago</a> in November 2022. Still, that event showed that the Groypers, now six years into their existence, have achieved what their predecessors could not: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/nick-fuentes-trump.html\">genuine cultural penetration and political influence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The old remedies no longer function. Authorities cannot ban an atmosphere or revoke the charter of a meme. Social media platforms designed to maximize engagement often maximize anger. Fuentes and imitators exploit this frustration.</p>\n\n<p>They remain controversial, and the Groypers’ lack of formal institutions could mean they will at some point fade like other far-right youth movements. Trump’s eventual exit from politics may also deprive them of a central reference point. </p>\n\n<p>But they might represent something new: a post-organizational extremism uniquely adapted to digital life.</p>\n\n<p>The Columbians once promised to control Atlanta in six months and America in 10 years. They lasted 10 months. The Groypers have already long outlasted them. That endurance signals a new, far more successful approach.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269776/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alex McPhee-Browne does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But few public health bodies have addressed social connection — until now. </p>\n\n<p>As scholars who focus on <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Aldrich\">public policy</a> and social determinants of health and <a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/fhs/about/people/profiles/kiffer-card.html\">well-being</a>, we are part of an international team of more than 100 experts who undertook the first systematic effort to develop <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2025.105452\">evidence-based guidelines for social connection</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These guidelines, <a href=\"https://www.socialconnectionguidelines.org/en\">which are now publicly available</a>, aim to do more than offer advice. Elements of them are already being embedded into policies in <a href=\"https://www.grocerydive.com/news/aisles-abroad-dutch-grocer-jumbo-slow-chat-checkouts/645702/\">the Netherlands</a> and <a href=\"https://reengage.org.uk/latest-news/five-years-on-from-the-first-minister-for-loneliness/\">the U.K</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our hope is that the guidelines can elevate the importance of social connection to the same level as basic public health practices such as exercising, not smoking and relying on a designated driver when you go out drinking with friends.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpSDuDIaBGk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Social isolation increases people’s risk of death dramatically – about as much as smoking does.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The value of guidelines</h2>\n\n<p>Research has shown for decades that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.21224\">social connection is crucial</a> for good health. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution\">World Health Organization’s constitution</a>, adopted in 1946, defines health as “complete physical, mental and social well-being.”</p>\n\n<p>Codifying different dimensions of health into evidence-based guidelines matters because guidelines allow people to put recommendations into action. Nutrition labels help people understand what they’re eating. Exercise recommendations help people know how much movement protects their health. Blood pressure cutoffs tell both patients and clinicians when it’s time to intervene.</p>\n\n<p>Guidelines also shape systems in ways people feel every day. Exercise guidelines, for example, helped motivate cities to invest in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8776244/\">walkable streets</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069X-8-47\">bike lanes</a>, workplaces to design wellness programs, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.10.013\">schools to include physical activity in curricula</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Social health guidelines can play a similar role. </p>\n\n<p>Standardized metrics for social well-being can help health care providers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44325-025-00044-y\">identify when someone is socially isolated</a>, enable employers to design <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/mhi/our-insights/thriving-workplaces-how-employers-can-improve-productivity-and-change-lives\">workplaces that foster connection</a>, and give schools and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2024.102195\">cities clearer targets for building socially supportive environments</a>. </p>\n\n<p>They also lay the groundwork for “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/amajethics.2023.795\">social prescriptions</a>” — structured ways to connect people with community programs or group activities — which some health care systems are already beginning to test.</p>\n\n<h2>The science of connection</h2>\n\n<p>Beginning in the summer of 2023, our team spent more than two years developing a set of international guidelines for social health by drawing on more than <a href=\"https://www.socialconnectionguidelines.org/en/evidence-briefs\">40 plain-language evidence summaries</a>, numerous <a href=\"https://www.socialconnectionguidelines.org/en/case-studies\">case studies</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaf131\">conversations with marginalized communities</a>, and extensive <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2025.105452\">consultation with global experts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What we found highlights several foundational principles of social well-being.</p>\n\n<p>First, there are no universal rules for social health. There is no magic number of friends or ideal number of weekly social hours. Social needs vary widely. Both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20551029231184034\">introverts and extroverts need connection</a>, but they meet that need differently. A new parent’s social world is completely unlike a retiree’s. And <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2025.2460068\">quality trumps quantity</a>: One meaningful conversation can be more nourishing than a dozen quick exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>Second, technology is not the villain it’s often made out to be. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2025.108688\">Passive scrolling can harm well-being</a>, but active, intentional use can strengthen bonds — whether through video calls with distant family, group chats that sustain friendships or apps that <a href=\"https://www.marmaladetrust.org/post/community-apps\">help neighbors organize local meetups</a>. The key is using technology to facilitate real connection rather than replace it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Older woman talking to family on a cell phone video call.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703508/original/file-20251119-66-yxm9u0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Technology can help maintain connections at a distance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/senior-woman-talking-to-family-on-video-call-at-royalty-free-image/2172605203\">FG Trade Latin/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Third, relationships are shaped as much by systems as by individuals. Social health isn’t just about personal effort. It emerges from local environments that make connection possible. Research shows that investments in social infrastructure – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/23789689.2025.2456363\">the places and spaces where we connect</a>, such as libraries, parks and cafes – measurably improve well-being. And communities that have denser concentrations of such spaces have better <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1468109922000366\">health outcomes after disasters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, diverse networks matter. Strong social health includes both close relationships and “weak ties” — acquaintances, neighbors, local business staff and others you see in passing. These lighter-touch interactions offer meaningful benefits: the barista who remembers your order, a colleague you exchange a few words with, a fellow dog walker along your route. </p>\n\n<p>Studies show that <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392\">weak ties provide novel information</a>, unexpected opportunities and a broader sense of belonging that close friends alone can’t provide. A mix of ties — deep and shallow — forms the basis of a socially healthy life.</p>\n\n<h2>From research to reality</h2>\n\n<p>Forward-thinking institutions are already experimenting with principles that underpin our guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Some workplaces <a href=\"https://www.springhealth.com/blog/how-workplaces-can-address-the-social-determinants-of-health\">now assess social health</a> when making decisions about policies such as remote work or office layout, recognizing that communication norms and physical design shape how employees connect. Schools are <a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/24/03/why-emotional-intelligence-matters-educators\">teaching emotional intelligence</a> and friendship skills as core curriculum, not extras. Cities are investing in social infrastructure — community  centers, shared public spaces and plazas — that naturally bring people together.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal level, the guidelines suggest a few simple shifts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Prioritize face-to-face time.</strong> Even short, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12626\">in-person interactions boost mood</a>, reduce stress and build trust.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use technology actively, not passively.</strong> Reach out to someone, schedule a video call or use apps to create opportunities for connection — not just to scroll.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Treat solitude as restoration, not failure.</strong> Healthy social lives include both meaningful interaction and the downtime needed to recharge.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Build routines that create natural interaction.</strong> Walk the same route daily, become a regular at neighborhood spots or join recurring community activities to create predictable opportunities for connection.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>And most importantly, take initiative.</strong> In a culture that treats socializing as a luxury, prioritizing connection is quietly radical.</p></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268560/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kiffer George Card receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Health Research BC.

Elissa Slotkin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/democratic-lawmakers-illegal-orders.html\">told The New York Times</a> that she had heard from troops currently serving that they were worried about their own liability in actions such as the ones in the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26289122-opinion-in-dc-national-guard-lawsuit/\">not the first time</a> Trump has put members of the military in <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/trump-national-guard-posse-comitatus/\">situations whose legality</a> <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/military-personnel-seek-legal-advice-on-whether-trump-ordered-missions-are-lawful\">has been questioned</a>. But a large percentage of service members understand their duty to follow the law in such a difficult moment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M7GxgRkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">We are scholars</a> of <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/political-science/about/directory/geraldine-santoso\">international relations</a> and international law. We conducted survey research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s <a href=\"https://www.humansecuritylab.net/\">Human Security Lab</a> <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6036ca5c01be1f3ada2fcc09/t/68927fda1e3d781c333f40e8/1754431458649/RIWI_HSLAB_Toplines_June2025.pdf\">and discovered that</a> many service members do understand the distinction between legal and illegal orders, the duty to disobey certain orders, and when they should do so.</p>\n\n<h2>The ethical dilemma</h2>\n\n<p>With his Aug. 11, 2025, announcement that he was <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/08/trump-federalizes-dc-police-says-takeover-will-enable-federal-employees-work-peace/407370/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story\">sending the National Guard</a> – along with federal law enforcement – into Washington, D.C. to fight crime, Trump edged U.S. troops closer to the kind of military-civilian confrontations that can cross ethical and legal lines.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, since Trump returned to office, many of his actions have <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163181\">alarmed international human rights observers</a>. His administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/courts-immigrants-venezuelans-garcia-trump.html\">deported immigrants without due process</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/less-than-human-report-details-trump-immigration-detention-centre-abuses\">held detainees in inhumane conditions</a>, threatened the <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/trump-doubles-down-on-plan-to-empty-gaza-this-is-what-he-has-said-and-whats-at-stake/\">forcible removal</a> of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and deployed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/trump-national-guard-california.html\">both the National Guard and federal military troops</a> to Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, Chicago and other cities to quell largely peaceful protests or enforce immigration laws. </p>\n\n<p>When a sitting commander in chief authorizes acts like these, which many assert are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-illegal.html\">clear violations of the law</a>, men and women in uniform face an ethical dilemma: How should they respond to an order they believe is illegal? </p>\n\n<p>The question may already be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/trump-national-guard-california.html\">affecting troop morale</a>. “The moral injuries of this operation, I think, will be enduring,” a National Guard member who had been deployed to quell public unrest over immigration arrests in Los Angeles told The New York Times. “This is not what the military of our country was designed to do, at all.”</p>\n\n<p>Troops who are ordered to do something illegal are put in a bind – so much so that some argue that <a href=\"https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-107-issue-5/abuse-by-authority-the-hidden-harm-of-illegal-orders\">troops themselves are harmed</a> when given such orders. They are not trained in legal nuances, and they are <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/17/1/105/5374741\">conditioned</a> to obey. Yet if they obey “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Obeying-Orders-Atrocity-Military-Discipline/dp/076580798X\">manifestly unlawful</a>” orders, they can be prosecuted. Some analysts <a href=\"https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JLPP-27-2-Ghiotto.pdf\">fear that U.S. troops are ill-equipped</a> to recognize this threshold. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a blue jacket, white shirt and red tie at a lectern, speaking.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump, flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi, announced at a White House news conference on Aug. 11, 2025, that he was deploying the National Guard to assist in restoring law and order in Washington.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-c-speaks-during-a-press-conference-news-photo/2228986302?adppopup=true\">Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Compelled to disobey</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. service members <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/55743/law-military-obedience-mattis-military-orders/\">take an oath</a> to uphold the Constitution. In addition, under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, service members must obey lawful orders and <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/72934/wrestling-with-legal-and-illegal-orders-in-the-military-in-the-months-ahead/\">disobey unlawful orders</a>. Unlawful orders are those that clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, international human rights standards or the Geneva Conventions. </p>\n\n<p>Service members who follow an illegal order <a href=\"https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/2024%20MCM%20files/MCM%20(2024%20ed)%20-%20TOC%20no%20index.pdf?ver=b7JVpxV5rbIHg0ENlCRVKQ%3D%3D\">can be held liable</a> and court-martialed or subject to prosecution by international tribunals. Following orders from a superior is no defense.</p>\n\n<p>Our poll, fielded between June 13 and June 30, 2025, shows that service members understand these rules. Of the 818 active-duty troops we surveyed, just 9% stated that they would “obey any order.” Only 9% “didn’t know,” and only 2% had “no comment.” </p>\n\n<p>When asked to describe unlawful orders in their own words, about 25% of respondents wrote about their duty to disobey orders that were “obviously wrong,” “obviously criminal” or “obviously unconstitutional.” </p>\n\n<p>Another 8% spoke of immoral orders. One respondent wrote that “orders that clearly break international law, such as targeting non-combatants, are not just illegal — they’re immoral. As military personnel, we have a duty to uphold the law and refuse commands that betray that duty.” </p>\n\n<p>Just over 40% of respondents listed specific examples of orders they would feel compelled to disobey. </p>\n\n<p>The most common unprompted response, cited by 26% of those surveyed, was “harming civilians,” while another 15% of respondents gave a variety of other examples of violations of duty and law, such as “torturing prisoners” and “harming U.S. troops.” </p>\n\n<p>One wrote that “an order would be obviously unlawful if it involved harming civilians, using torture, targeting people based on identity, or punishing others without legal process.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of responses such as 'I'd disobey if illegal' and 'I'd disobey if immoral.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A tag cloud of responses to UMass-Amherst’s Human Security Lab survey of active-duty service members about when they would disobey an order from a superior.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">UMass-Amherst’s Human Security Lab</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Soldiers, not lawyers</h2>\n\n<p>But the open-ended answers pointed to another struggle troops face: Some no longer trust U.S. law as useful guidance. </p>\n\n<p>Writing in their own words about how they would know an illegal order when they saw it, more troops emphasized international law as a standard of illegality than emphasized U.S. law. </p>\n\n<p>Others implied that acts that are illegal under international law might become legal in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>“Trump will issue illegal orders,” wrote one respondent. “The new laws will allow it,” wrote another. A third wrote, “We are not required to obey such laws.”</p>\n\n<p>Several emphasized the U.S. political situation directly in their remarks, stating they’d disobey “oppression or harming U.S. civilians that clearly goes against the Constitution” or an order for “use of the military to carry out deportations.” </p>\n\n<p>Still, the percentage of respondents who said they would disobey specific orders – such as torture – is lower than the percentage of respondents who recognized the responsibility to disobey in general. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>This is not surprising: <a href=\"https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JLPP-27-2-Ghiotto.pdf\">Troops are trained</a> to obey and face numerous social, psychological and institutional <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/17/1/105/5374741\">pressures</a> to do so. By contrast, most troops receive relatively little training in the laws of war or human rights law. </p>\n\n<p>Political scientists have found, however, that having information on international law <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343316657405\">affects attitudes about the use of force</a> among the general public. It <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00223433211010861?casa_token=TNwYUToDynUAAAAA:gg0XKxkUc4PxQ38YueLi7V9Oq-x5CvJqtXW-67MwqAu4-Zu0c51fcNMauttupFqMMaRxAr0JZiMadQ\">can also affect</a> decision-making by military personnel. </p>\n\n<p>This finding was also borne out in our survey. </p>\n\n<p>When we explicitly reminded troops that shooting civilians was a violation of international law, their willingness to disobey increased 8 percentage points.</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing the line</h2>\n\n<p>As my research with another scholar <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00392\">showed in 2020</a>, even thinking about law and morality can make a difference in opposition to certain war crimes. </p>\n\n<p>The preliminary results from our survey led to a similar conclusion. Troops who answered questions on “manifestly unlawful orders” before they were asked questions on specific scenarios were much more likely to say they would refuse those specific illegal orders.</p>\n\n<p>When asked if they would follow an order to drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, for example, 69% of troops who received that question first said they would obey the order. </p>\n\n<p>But when the respondents were asked to think about and comment on the duty to disobey unlawful orders before being asked if they would follow the order to bomb, the percentage who would obey the order dropped 13 points to 56%.</p>\n\n<p>While many troops said they might obey questionable orders, the large number who would not is remarkable. </p>\n\n<p>Military culture makes disobedience difficult: Soldiers can be court-martialed for obeying an unlawful order, or for disobeying a lawful one. </p>\n\n<p>Yet between one-third to half of the U.S. troops we surveyed would be willing to disobey if ordered to shoot or starve civilians, torture prisoners or drop a nuclear bomb on a city.</p>\n\n<p>The service members described the methods they would use. Some would confront their superiors directly. Others imagined indirect methods: asking questions, creating diversions, going AWOL, “becoming violently ill.”  </p>\n\n<p>Criminologist Eva Whitehead researched actual cases of troop disobedience of illegal orders and <a href=\"https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/121568293/E%20%20Whitehead%20-%20thesis.pdf\">found that when some troops disobey</a> – even indirectly – others can more easily find the courage to do the same. </p>\n\n<p>Whitehead’s research showed that those who refuse to follow illegal or immoral orders are most effective when they stand up for their actions openly.</p>\n\n<p>The initial results of our survey – coupled with a recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/hotline-for-military-service-members-sees-uptick-in-calls-following-activations-in-los-angeles/4209240/?os=vb_73kqvpgino_journeystrue&amp;ref=app\">spike in calls to the GI Rights Hotline</a> – suggest American men and women in uniform don’t want to obey unlawful orders. </p>\n\n<p>Some are <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/197545/soldiers-military-right-refuse-trump-unlawful-orders\">standing up loudly</a>. Many are thinking ahead to what they might do if confronted with unlawful orders. And those we surveyed are looking for guidance from the Constitution and international law to determine where they may have to draw that line.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story, initially published on Aug. 13, 2025, has been updated to include a reference to a video issued by Democratic members of Congress.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Zahra Marashi, an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, contributed to the research for this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270401/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charli Carpenter directs Human Security Lab which has received funding from University of Massachusetts College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the National Science Foundation, and the Lex International Fund of the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Geraldine Santoso does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The law was the <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-first-state-artificial-intelligence-regulations/\">first of its kind</a> in the U.S. It was a comprehensive attempt to govern “high-risk” artificial intelligence systems across various industries before they could cause real-world harm. </p>\n\n<p>Gov.

Colorado lawmakers have <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/25/colorado-ai-law-tweak-dies/\">delayed the law’s enactment</a> to June 2026 and are seeking to repeal and replace portions of it.</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers face pressure from the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2025/08/26/big-tech-ai-colorado-law\">tech industry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/in-delaying-its-ai-law-colorado-shows-tech-lobbys-power-in-state-politics/\">lobbyists</a> and the practicalities related to the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/08/11/why-colorado-is-rethinking-its-ai-law-00502621\">cost of implementation</a>. </p>\n\n<p>What Colorado does next will shape whether its early move becomes a model for other states or a lesson in the challenges of regulating emerging technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I study how <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=xjXALp0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">AI and data science are reshaping policymaking</a> and democratic accountability. I’m interested in what Colorado’s pioneering efforts to regulate AI can teach other state and federal legislators.</p>\n\n<h2>The first state to act</h2>\n\n<p>In 2024, Colorado legislators decided not to <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/2025-may-be-the-year-of-ai-legislation-will-we-see-consensus-rules-or-a-patchwork/\">wait for the U.S. Congress to act</a> on nationwide AI policy.

The law’s goal was <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/06/17/colorado-artificial-intelligence-law-implementation-ramifications/\">straightforward but ambitious</a>: Create preventive protections for consumers from algorithmic discrimination while encouraging innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s leadership on this is not surprising. The state has a climate that embraces <a href=\"https://www.coloradopolitics.com/2025/09/30/is-denver-poised-to-become-the-silicon-valley-of-the-new-west/\">technological innovation</a> and a <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2025/07/26/ai-skills-tech-colorado-job-openings/\">rapidly growing AI sector</a>. The state positioned itself at the frontier of AI governance, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-why-colorados-new-ai-law-is-set-to-make-a-splash\">drawing from international models such as the EU AI Act</a> and from privacy frameworks such as the <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/californias-approach-to-ai-governance/\">2018 California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. With an initial effective date of Feb. 1, 2026, lawmakers gave themselves ample time to refine definitions, establish oversight mechanisms and build capacity for compliance.</p>\n\n<p>When the law passed in May 2024, policy analysts and advocacy groups hailed it as a breakthrough. Other states, including Georgia and Illinois, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-different-states-are-approaching-ai/\">introduced bills closely modeled after Colorado’s AI bill</a>, though those proposals did not advance to final enactment. The law was described by the <a href=\"https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FPF-FINAL-CO-SB-205-Two-Pager-.pdf\">Future of Privacy Forum</a> as the “first comprehensive and risk-based approach” to AI accountability. The forum is a nonprofit research and advocacy organization that develops guidance and policy analysis on data privacy and emerging technologies. </p>\n\n<p>Legal commentators, <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/a-deep-dive-into-colorados-artificial-intelligence-act/\">including attorneys general across the nation</a>, noted that Colorado created robust AI legislation that other states could emulate in the absence of federal legislation. </p>\n\n<h2>Politics meets process, stalling progress</h2>\n\n<p>Praise aside, passing a bill is one thing, but putting it into action is another.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after the bill was signed, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/15/ai-tech-regulations-lobbying-00157676\">tech companies and trade associations</a> warned that the act could create heavy administrative burdens for startups and deter innovation. Polis, in his signing statement, cautioned that “<a href=\"https://tsscolorado.com/with-reservations-polis-signs-landmark-ai-regulation-bill/\">a complex compliance regime</a>” might slow economic growth. He urged legislators to revisit portions of the bill.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4VTAPk8ip4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">CBS News Colorado reports on state lawmakers racing to replace the state’s artificial intelligence law before February 2026.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/25/colorado-budget-artificial-intelligence-special-session/\">Polis convened a special legislative session</a> to reconsider portions of the law. <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/08/27/colorado-special-session-leads-to-further-delay-of-states-ai-law/\">Multiple bills were introduced</a> to amend or delay its implementation. <a href=\"https://tsscolorado.com/business-leaders-plead-for-changes-in-states-new-ai-law/\">Industry advocates</a> pressed for narrower definitions and longer timelines. All the while, <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/12/10/colorado-refines-ai-discrimination-law/\">consumer groups</a> fought to preserve the act’s protections. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, other states watched closely and changed course on sweeping AI policy. Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/california-governor-gavin-newsom-vetoes-ai-safety-bill\">slowed California’s own ambitious AI bill after facing similar concerns</a>. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-legislature-adjournment-artificial-intelligence-617d20eaba36a6fc8ad055ff9b4d7055\">Connecticut failed to pass its AI legislation</a> amid a veto threat from Gov. Ned Lamont. </p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s early lead turned precarious. The same boldness that made it first also made the law vulnerable – particularly because, as seen in other states, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/the-politics-of-ai-innovation-in-the-us-states/\">governors can veto, delay or narrow AI legislation as political dynamics shift</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>From big swing to small ball</h2>\n\n<p>In my opinion, Colorado can remain a leader in AI policy by pivoting toward “<a href=\"https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/policy-incrementalism-how-philanthropy-can-support-change\">small ball,” or incremental, policymaking</a>, characterized by gradual improvements, monitoring and iteration. </p>\n\n<p>This means focusing not just on lofty goals but on the practical architecture of implementation. That would include defining what counts as high-risk applications and clarifying compliance duties. It could also include launching pilot programs to test regulatory mechanisms before full enforcement and building impact assessments to measure the effects on innovation and equity. And finally, it could engage developers and community stakeholders in shaping norms and standards.</p>\n\n<p>This incrementalism is not a retreat from the initial goal but rather realism. Most durable policy <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-case-for-incremental-change-with-greg-berman-and-aubrey-fox/\">emerges from gradual refinement</a>, not sweeping reform. For example, the EU’s AI Act is <a href=\"https://nitafarahany.substack.com/p/the-eu-ai-acts-reality-check-inside\">actually being implemented in stages</a> rather than all at once, according to legal scholar Nita Farahany.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_rxOnCt3HQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A video from EU Made Simple explains the EU’s AI regulation, which was the first in the world.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Effective governance of complex technologies requires iteration and adjustment. The same was true for <a href=\"https://privacytrust.com/delays-to-the-new-eu-data-protection-law-implementation/\">data privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3693527-eu-contemplates-delay-in-groundbreaking-anti-deforestation-law\">environmental regulation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/transparency-is-essential-for-effective-social-media-regulation/\">social media oversight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 2010s, social media platforms grew unchecked, <a href=\"https://time.com/7326940/america-must-regulate-social-media/\">generating public benefits but also new harms</a>. Only after extensive research and <a href=\"https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/chaire-numerique/en/2020/07/09/how-public-pressure-forced-facebook-to-change-its-policies-on-hate-speech/\">public pressure</a> did governments begin <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/states-in-the-vanguard-social-media-policy-today/\">regulating content and data practices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s AI law may represent the start of a similar trajectory: an early, imperfect step that prompts learning, revision and eventual standardization across states.</p>\n\n<p>The core challenge is striking a workable balance. Regulations need to protect people from unfair or unclear AI decisions without creating such heavy burdens that businesses hesitate to build or deploy new tools. With its thriving tech sector and pragmatic policy culture, Colorado is well positioned to model that balance by embracing incremental, accountable policymaking. In doing so, the state can turn a stalled start into a blueprint for how states nationwide might govern AI responsibly.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269065/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stefani Langehennig receives funding from the American Political Science Association&#39;s (APSA) Centennial Center Research Center.</span></em></p>",

Most political memoirs are written to advance the politician’s career. Fetterman’s, however, discusses his dissatisfaction with Congress and spends far more time on his battles with depression than his role as a senator. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reforming-philadelphia-1682-2022\">a politics professor who studies Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, I find that one of the most unique things about Fetterman is his political rise from mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania – a small borough outside Pittsburgh with fewer than 2,000 residents – to the U.S. Senate.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, while this sort of political leap is highly unusual, it also reflects a recent trend in American politics. Over the past five years, more mayors of small and midsized cities have developed national political profiles in a way they hadn’t before.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a phenomenon that has roots in suburbanization and 1990s-era political trends, and it’s one we will likely see again in 2028, at least among Democrats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"View of steel plant and river with residential homes in distance\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A view of a steel plant in Braddock, Pa.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/general-view-of-the-exterior-of-the-u-s-steel-edgar-news-photo/2092452512\">Jeff Swensen via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From small town to Senate chambers</h2>\n\n<p>Boroughs are the smallest form of municipality in Pennsylvania, and there are <a href=\"https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/how-many-municipalities-are-in-pennsylvania/\">more than 950 of them</a> in the state. The office of borough mayor is so insignificant that in Braddock, it came with a small stipend instead of a salary. </p>\n\n<p>Yet after holding that obscure position for a decade, Fetterman mounted a credible campaign to be the Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in 2016. He fell short but captured <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/pennsylvania\">nearly 20% of the primary vote</a> against three other candidates.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Fetterman was <a href=\"https://www.cityandstatepa.com/personality/2021/06/how-john-fetterman-redefined-role-lieutenant-governor/364575/\">elected Pennsylvania lieutenant governor</a>, and then in 2022, he ran again for the Senate. He beat Conor Lamb <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/17/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html\">by a landslide</a> in the Democratic primary and then <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/pennsylvania-senate-results/\">squeaked out a victory</a> against Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem incredible that someone could jump from being a borough mayor to lieutenant governor and then U.S. senator. But other politicians over the past decade have used their positions as mayors of small-to-midsized cities to run for national office, including the U.S. presidency. </p>\n\n<p>Cory Booker, for instance, was elected mayor of Newark, New Jersey, in 2006; U.S. senator in 2013; and briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Booker was joined in the early race to be the Democratic presidential nominee by Pete Buttigieg, who was elected mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in 2011; and Wayne Messam, who was elected mayor of Miramar, Florida, in 2015. </p>\n\n<p>The 2020 presidential primaries also included some big-city mayors like then-New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio and his immediate predecessor, Mike Bloomberg. Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles at the time, was apparently also <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/eric-garcetti-pete-buttigieg-joe-biden/604594/\">considering a presidential run in 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Younger man in white dress shirt and tie shakes hand with older man using cane as crowd mills around behind them\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=436&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=436&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=436&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703674/original/file-20251120-66-nd9ggp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=548&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘Mayor Pete’ Buttigieg speaks to a supporter at a Polish holiday celebration in South Bend, Ind., in 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/south-bend-mayor-and-democratic-presidential-candidate-pete-news-photo/1138738724\">Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By contrast, before 2020, a grand total of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/mayors-for-presidents/\">13 people who had ever served as a mayor later ran for president</a>. Only Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge were successful.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Fetterman has never run for president, but then, few mayors ever run for U.S. Senate either. As Booker noted in his 2017 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/258402/united-by-cory-booker/\">“United,”</a> he was, in 2013, the 1,949th person to ever be sworn in as a U.S. senator, but “only the 21st person since 1789 to ascend directly from mayor to Senator.” </p>\n\n<h2>Free trade and fractured bonds</h2>\n\n<p>How did this trend start? I trace it back to the eight years of the Clinton presidency, from 1993 to 2001, and more specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R42965\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> that went into effect in 1994 and the Clinton administration’s focus on community and civil society.</p>\n\n<p>NAFTA was a treaty signed by the U.S., Mexico and Canada agreeing to lift tariffs and other barriers to trade. It had bipartisan support, but it was also politically divisive, especially with labor unions, historically a key pillar of the Democratic Party, which did not want to see manufacturers move their operations to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. </p>\n\n<p>NAFTA is often blamed for, among other things, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/magazine/nafta-tarriffs-economy-trump-kamala-harris.html\">“hollowing out” of U.S. communities in the Rust Belt</a> that stretches from the Northeast to the Upper Midwest states that surround the Great Lakes. In this vast area, there are thousands of small and midsized towns and cities, many of which depended on single industries like paper milling or auto parts manufacturing. Once those businesses relocated, residents found themselves unemployed, underemployed and stranded in increasingly poorer towns.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, President Bill Clinton convened a series of <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-truth-of-power/9780231144391/\">seminars on American democracy and community</a> at Camp David and the White House. He invited some of the country’s most prominent “communitarian” intellectuals to glean policy and speech ideas from them. He also established the AmeriCorps program, which expanded and provided support for various civic-oriented volunteer opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Of the mayors who developed national political profiles in the 2010s, arguably the most successful were Booker, Buttigieg and Fetterman. All three came from Rust Belt communities that had suffered severely from the deindustrialization that many residents and analysts of various stripes blamed on NAFTA, and all three spoke effectively about their personal experience with it in their communities. </p>\n\n<p>Each mayor was also able to tell stories about personal interactions and interventions in their cities that spoke to the sense of a lost community that came to define the turn of the 21st century. The hardest evidence for this lost community came from the book <a href=\"http://bowlingalone.com/\">“Bowling Alone”</a> by American political scientist Robert Putnam, who participated in the White House seminars on community and American democracy. </p>\n\n<p>It’s also notable that, prior to running for mayor of Braddock, Fetterman <a href=\"https://john-fetterman.medium.com/back-in-1995-i-quit-my-job-and-joined-americorps-c93e78b06527\">worked at an AmeriCorps program</a> in a poor Pittsburgh neighborhood.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Tall bald man in black shirt and jeans speaks to three workers sitting in a diner\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">John Fetterman talks to customers at a diner in the depressed steel town of Clairton, Pa., in 2018.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/mayor-john-fetterman-strikes-up-a-conversation-with-chuck-news-photo/978441172\">Michael S.

Urban areas are increasingly composed of people with liberal ideologies, while rural areas are increasingly more conservative. Suburban areas fall somewhere in between – often serving as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-trump-won-pennsylvania-and-what-the-numbers-from-key-counties-show-about-the-future-of-a-pivotal-swing-state-243127\">key battlegrounds in statewide elections</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Midsized cities like South Bend or Miramar are often suburban in nature and design. They typically don’t carry the Democratic ideological baggage of large cities, but they are often also dealing with so-called urban problems such as poverty and crime. This is especially true of Braddock, a suburb with uniquely high levels of <a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US4207992-braddock-pa/\">poverty and unemployment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A mayor like Fetterman can therefore show how he’s able to address fundamental and widespread problems while at the same time being relatively nonpartisan about it. Among his better-known <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/08/wrought-from-ruins\">accomplishments as Braddock mayor</a> were building a new community center, rehabbing properties, establishing an urban farm and running a youth program.</p>\n\n<p>No doubt, Fetterman is a unique politician. But he is also the product of a specific moment in American political development and culture when mayors became viable actors on the national stage. My guess is that this trend will continue in what will most likely be a crowded Democratic presidential primary race in 2028.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269993/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richardson Dilworth does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Frogs and other inflatable costumes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jb8rXPkL3xY\">became a fixture of protests</a> against Trump administration actions everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C26&amp;q=Anya+Galli+Robertson+&amp;btnG=\">sociologist</a> who studies social movements and political discourse, I knew when I saw the video that we’d soon see frogs everywhere at protests. </p>\n\n<p>And indeed, the costumes have visually distinguished recent events from earlier anti-Trump demonstrations, softening their public image at a time when Republican officials were calling protesters “violent” and “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/no-kings-protest-mike-johnson-00602705\">Antifa people</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to be violent in a frog suit.</p>\n\n<p>Humor is subversive.

They can help activists appear less threatening to police, evade <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-technology-is-altering-citizen-protests/\">facial recognition systems</a> and even deflect the blows of police batons or rubber bullets.</p>\n\n<p>Wearing inflatable costumes at demonstrations checks all the boxes for tactics that can be widely imitated: cultural relevance, symbolic power, accessibility and easy participation.

Social and economic changes shape how people negotiate love and labor across borders, as I explore in <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">my 2025 book, “Economies of Gender</a>.” In a chaotic world, some men and women turn to <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2025/08/gender-roles-sexism-jobs-class\">traditional gender roles</a> as a source of seeming stability – and that often leads them abroad.</p>\n\n<h2>Old industry, new look</h2>\n\n<p>The term “mail-order bride” dates back to the 19th century, when so-called <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479821327/buying-a-bride/\">frontier brides</a> advertised themselves in newspapers to single men in the American West. After the Civil War, when large numbers of men had died on the East Coast, some <a href=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2023/06/mail-order-brides/\">women saw migrating to the frontier</a> to marry someone sight unseen as a way to secure stability. That narrative still lingers today in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367877911419160\">Western novels and films</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The modern international matchmaking industry, however, took shape in the 1970s, when catalogs of mostly Filipino women’s photos and addresses were sold to American men. After being pen pals, men would travel to the Philippines to meet and decide whether they wanted to get married. Some scholars <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.36646/mjlr.28.1.mail-order\">consider this a form of human trafficking</a>, but that has been challenged by <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/flyer/books/romance-on-a-global-stage/paper\">other scholarship</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These catalogs emerged as more U.S. women were <a href=\"https://blog.dol.gov/2023/03/15/working-women-data-from-the-past-present-and-future\">entering the workforce</a> and earning their own money. Some men sought wives abroad who they believed would embody more traditional values – prioritizing domestic work and devoting themselves to men and children.</p>\n\n<p>Over the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm\">next few decades</a>, large numbers of <a href=\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds_legacy/244/\">stable, well-paying factory jobs disappeared</a>, further challenging some men’s view of themselves as breadwinners.</p>\n\n<p>By 2010, the catalog system had moved online and expanded into a global industry that generated <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2013/04/09/the-mail-order-bride-boom/\">US$2 billion dollars per year</a>. Today, it <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">takes many forms</a>. Most of the industry is online, with email and chat correspondence that charges men but not women. Some agencies provide in-person tours for male clients, and there are higher-end, more personalized matchmaking services as well.</p>\n\n<h2>From taboo to televised</h2>\n\n<p>What was once stigmatized has become more normalized through reality TV. TLC’s hit series “90 Day Fiance,” which came on air in 2014, has transformed international dating into <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/90-day-fiance-tlc-reality-tv-franchise-success.html\">a lucrative entertainment franchise</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A brunette woman with curly hair, wearing a pink sleeveless shirt, embraces a dark-haired man in a white t-shirt, with two suitcases in the corner.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The stresses of the K-1 visa process have become fodder for reality TV.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/couple-embraced-at-airport-royalty-free-image/187105138?phrase=airport%20girlfriend%20boyfriend%20welcome&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">AMR Image/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The show and its numerous spin-offs show couples navigating <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration/nonimmigrant-visa-for-a-fiance-k-1.html\">the K-1 visa process</a>, which gives 90 days to marry after a partner enters the country. If the wedding is called off, the foreign fiance or fiancee must return to their country of origin.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the featured couples met randomly, in person. A significant number, however, connected through online dating or language-learning sites. Numerous couples’ storylines highlight family and friends of the American partner who question the girlfriend’s or boyfriend’s motives, accusing them of faking love for financial gain and access to a <a href=\"https://cis.org/North/Victims-MarriageRelated-Immigration-Fraud-Tell-Their-Stories\">green card</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Audiences might watch the show for drama or love stories, but the underlying themes mirror what I’ve seen in the field: relationships shaped by <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">economic inequality and migration</a>, with women often exchanging emotional, domestic and sexual labor in return for financial stability.</p>\n\n<h2>Rise of the ‘passport bros’</h2>\n\n<p>In recent years, the mail-order bride industry has gotten a cultural revamp, with younger and more diverse men who identify as “passport bros.” This crowd is typically <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/bang-the-world-nathan-west\">younger than men</a> participating in the commercial international dating industry and more likely to identify as men of color. </p>\n\n<p>These men are less likely to pay for formal dating and introduction services. They travel on their own, using free dating apps such as Tinder to meet local women – mostly in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/watch-the-passport-bros-in-search-of-king-treatment-in-colombia/\">Colombia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-entrepreneur-found-dead-in-brazilian-rental-home-authorities-suspect-foul-play/\">Brazil</a> and the Dominican Republic.</p>\n\n<p>Passport bros say they travel abroad to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a64387699/what-is-a-passport-bro/\">meet women who are more traditional</a> than the ones they meet at home. Many of the American men I interviewed between 2010 and 2022 talked about Western women as too focused on career, which challenged their idea of themselves as financial providers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a black t-shirt and gray button-up rests his arm on the bar as he tries to talk to a woman in a pink top.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘Passport bros’ fly solo rather than paying for international dating services.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-shows-gesture-stop-to-man-talking-at-table-in-royalty-free-image/2153049544?phrase=man%20harassing%20women%20in%20bar&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Stanislav Smoliakov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=n2wgW2AAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">my research in Ukraine, Colombia and the Philippines</a> shows that many men using international dating services are motivated by more than just love or cultural curiosity. They are responding to a changing world in which women’s financial independence has challenged traditional male roles. For some, traveling abroad is a way to reassert control and to find <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9780814759479/love-and-empire/\">relationships that reaffirm a sense of masculine identity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my interviews, American men looking abroad talked about feeling empowered and having choices, while being ignored in the U.S. dating market. Some recognized that their relative wealth is the cause of this. As one man on a romance tour in Ukraine told me in 2012, “I am here to exchange my financial stability for some Ukrainian woman’s youth and beauty, and I am OK with that.” </p>\n\n<h2>Appeal of ‘tradition’</h2>\n\n<p>Together, many of these daters illustrate <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4149432\">the global pattern</a> I’ve seen across <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/wsq.2017.0028\">my years of fieldwork</a>: anxiety fuels a longing for traditionalism.</p>\n\n<p>What appears to be a return to the past is, in reality, an adaptation to the present. The romance tours, the “90 Day Fiance” phenomenon and the passport bros speak to how people use relationships to navigate the economic instability of the modern world. Gender roles become a way to reestablish order and identity.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, rising inflation, stagnant wages and housing shortages have left many people, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/03/us-economy-gen-z-stability-disillusion\">younger generations, feeling economically trapped</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/\">COVID-19 pandemic</a> deepened these inequalities, forcing millions out of the workforce and amplifying the strain of unpaid caregiving, particularly for women.</p>\n\n<p>In times of uncertainty, societies often retreat to familiar narratives. Traditional gender roles offer an illusion of stability and order, even if they reinforce inequality. The fantasy of the dependable male provider and the nurturing homemaker resurfaces because it seems to resolve anxieties that the modern economy has made harder to bear.</p>\n\n<p>As a sociologist, I study these dynamics not just to understand dating trends but to trace how societies reproduce inequality through intimacy. Until our society addresses stagnant wages, rising costs and the erosion of social safety nets, I believe nostalgia for a clear, gendered hierarchy will continue. In this hierarchy, men are guaranteed women’s labor, and women hold out hope for economic security – which is often seen as romance.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268616/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julia Meszaros receives funding from East Texas A&amp;M and Florida International University to support her research.

In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted an “<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html\">individualized decision-making</a>” <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-hepatitis-bvaccine-vote-delayed-parents/story?id=125731004\">approach to COVID-19 vaccination</a> instead of broadly recommending the vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not just the public that is confused. Many physicians and pharmacists also have questions about whether and how they can administer COVID-19 vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>As philosophers with <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqiUIzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">expertise in bioethics</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mbfKbrgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">legal philosophy</a>, we have been following the ethical and regulatory landscape for COVID-19 vaccines since they first became available in late 2020.</p>\n\n<p>In the fall of 2025 that landscape looks a bit different in light of the new guidelines. While it is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccines-for-kids-are-mired-in-uncertainty-amid-conflicting-federal-guidance-262685\">causing understandable confusion</a>, most people who want to get a COVID-19 vaccine can do so. Broad access is possible, in part, through what in health care is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.017\">“off-label use</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>“Off-label” refers to using an FDA-approved product for a different purpose, or with a different population, than that for which it received approval. Off-label prescriptions are common in health care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.161.3.282\">particularly in pediatrics</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>COVID-19 vaccines from 2020-2025</h2>\n\n<p>People likely recall that COVID-19 vaccines were <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/the-fastest-vaccine-in-history\">developed faster</a> than any vaccine had been previously, thanks to efforts such as the U.S. government’s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319\">Operation Warp Speed</a>. Initially limited in supply, the vaccines first became available through “<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization\">emergency use authorization</a>” in December 2020, with health care workers among the first prioritized by the government to receive them. </p>\n\n<p>In August 2021, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-does-full-fda-approval-of-a-vaccine-do-if-its-already-authorized-for-emergency-use-165654\">FDA fully approved</a> the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine\">first COVID-19 vaccine</a> for people ages 16 and up. Following this, <a href=\"https://jha.scholasticahq.com/article/131701-advocacy-bioethics-and-regulating-covid-19-vaccines-for-children-under-5\">younger children started to become eligible for COVID-19 vaccines</a>. From 2022 through summer 2025, COVID-19 vaccines were available to everyone 6 months and older in doctors’ offices or pharmacies, mostly free of charge, albeit with <a href=\"https://www.thehastingscenter.org/covid-is-surging-most-young-children-still-are-unvaccinated\">disparities in access</a> due to an individual’s age, geographic location or vaccine costs.</p>\n\n<p>But in May 2025, the new FDA and CDC <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929\">leadership appointed by the Trump administration</a> started to <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=20\">change their agencies’ positions</a> on COVID-19 vaccines. Such regulatory changes affect who is considered eligible for the vaccines and whether public and private insurers must provide coverage. Meanwhile, state laws influence the ability of pharmacists, who frequently provide routine vaccinations, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/\">to administer COVID-19 vaccines</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding the role of federal agencies such as the FDA and the CDC, as well as medical professional organizations and guidelines, can help untangle the complicated picture for access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0inVmipMa4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Critics of the changes note that when a vaccine is available but not recommended, fewer may choose to be vaccinated and more disease may circulate unchecked in the general population.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>2025 changes to FDA and CDC guidance</h2>\n\n<p>It’s helpful to understand the process through which vaccines become approved and endorsed by government agencies in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>First, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs\">FDA approves drugs and other biologic products such as vaccines</a> for specific uses, in specific age groups – in this case, to prevent people from getting COVID-19 or, if they do get it, to reduce the severity of their symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the CDC recommends products that the FDA has approved or authorized. These <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html\">recommendations have a different regulatory function</a> than the initial FDA decisions. The CDC issues public health guidelines for which vaccines people should receive and which ones public and private insurance must cover. In some states, the CDC’s recommendations also affect whether pharmacies can administer vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>Until September 2025, when the CDC shifted its stance, the agency broadly recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone 6 months of age and older, regardless of their underlying conditions. These recommendations supported public health and ensured that public and private insurance covered 100% of the cost of these vaccines as preventive health care.</p>\n\n<h2>Medical and CDC recommendations</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the FDA’s updated eligibility criteria and the CDC’s revised guidance, medical professional organizations have <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/117383\">continued to broadly recommend COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In August, the American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx\">issued its own vaccine schedule</a>. In addition to kids who meet FDA eligibility due to heightened risk, the organization recommends that all <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pediatricians-association-recommends-covid-19-vaccines-for-toddlers-and-some-older-children-breaking-with-cdc-guidance-263522\">children between 6 months and 2 years old be vaccinated against COVID-19</a>, as well as any child whose parent or guardian wants them to be vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP – the committee that advises the CDC on vaccine policy – met in mid-September, it <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/upcoming.html\">voted to recommend that anyone 6 months and older</a> can get a COVID-19 vaccine according to “individual-based decision-making.” The committee also voted to require continued funding of COVID-19 vaccines through private and public health insurance and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html\">Vaccines for Children program</a> that provides free vaccines to children who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured or underinsured. In October, the interim CDC director <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/cdc-immunization-schedule-adopts-individual-based-decision.html\">adopted the ACIP recommendations</a> as the formal guidance from the CDC for the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>These recommendations from the CDC and medical professional organizations are difficult to square with the FDA labeling changes for COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC is recommending that people make individual decisions with their medical providers about COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of their eligibility through FDA approval. </p>\n\n<p>This is possible because anyone who doesn’t meet FDA eligibility can get a COVID-19 vaccine through off-label use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Pregnant woman holding her abdomen, getting vaccine injection in her arm from doctor syringe.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still recommends that people who are pregnant get the COVID-19 vaccine.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pregnant-woman-holding-her-abdomen-getting-vaccine-royalty-free-image/1407090356?phrase=covid-19%20shots&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Olga Rolenko/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Off-label use of COVID-19 vaccines</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.3462\">Using COVID-19 vaccines off-label</a> means administering them for the same purpose but to a wider population than those who are FDA-eligible. In 2021 the CDC <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1296\">prohibited the off-label use</a> of COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the federal government. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/off-label-use-is-common-in-medicine-a-bioethicist-and-legal-philosopher-explain-why-the-covid-19-vaccines-are-different-171007\">This was an unusual move</a> and is no longer the case. </p>\n\n<p>While uncommon, off-label vaccination is sometimes recommended. One example is off-label vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, for children under 12 months old who <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html\">plan to travel</a> to areas where measles is not eradicated, or are exposed to a disease outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the CDC’s 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine recommendations remove certain barriers that typically accompany off-label use.</p>\n\n<p>For example, products used off-label are not always covered by insurance. Many private insurers <a href=\"https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage\">already committed to covering COVID-19 vaccines</a> as preventive care for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. The recommendations from ACIP and the CDC subsequently guaranteed that private and public health insurance plans would continue to <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html\">cover COVID-19 vaccines in full</a>. This includes COVID-19 vaccines under the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html\">Vaccines for Children</a> program that purchases vaccines for approximately half of U.S. children.</p>\n\n<p>Off-label use of a product is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33234538/\">ethically and legally permissible</a> if a physician believes its benefits outweigh its risks for their patient. But the CDC’s recommendation for individual decision-making may also lessen clinicians’ worries about liability. So might the guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv\">vaccine recommendations that anyone who is pregnant should get</a> an updated COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>Off-label use is typically done via a doctor’s prescription. Yet many COVID-19 vaccines are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/vaccinations-administered-pharmacies-medical.html\">administered in pharmacies</a>. Getting vaccinated in a pharmacy is especially helpful for people without primary care doctors or the time or money for a clinic visit. Many states have taken steps to remove barriers to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/these-states-are-taking-steps-to-ease-access-to-covid-19-vaccines\">obtaining off-label COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies</a>. The CDC’s October 2025 recommendations for individual decision-making also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation\">enable COVID-19 vaccination by pharmacists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For people who would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, knowing how off-label use fits into current regulations may be helpful for understanding their access to vaccines this respiratory virus season, and medical treatment in general.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268345/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Its <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients\">agreement with pharmaceutical giants</a>, announced Nov. 6, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/06/trumprx-weight-loss-drug-discounts-wegovy-zepbound/\">will reduce the monthly prices</a> of these medications by hundreds of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>For the past 25 years, I have <a href=\"https://cph.temple.edu/directory/david-b-sarwer-tug35552\">treated people with obesity</a> and have <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4nlvoj4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">developed and studied treatments</a> for the condition in both adults and adolescents. One major frustration of my work is the fact that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23556\">evidenced-based treatments</a> for obesity are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2018.10.005\">woefully underused</a></p>\n\n<p>These drugs, originally approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/drugs-that-melt-away-pounds-still-present-more-questions-than-answers-but-ozempic-wegovy-and-mounjaro-could-be-key-tools-in-reducing-the-obesity-epidemic-205549\">mimic a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1</a> that regulates  blood sugar and reduces appetite.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, by making GLP-1 drugs more accessible to patients, this agreement represents one of the most significant advances the federal government has made to address obesity, one of the country’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1477401\">most pressing public health issues</a>. However, this reduced price tag alone may not make a meaningful dent in rates of obesity in American adults without additional policy changes.</p>\n\n<h2>Treating obesity</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 40% of adults in the U.S. – more than 70 million people – <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/159281\">have obesity</a>. Researchers and clinicians generally define obesity based on a measure called body mass index, or BMI, which is the ratio of a person’s weight in kilograms to their height in meters, squared. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bmi-alone-will-no-longer-be-treated-as-the-go-to-measure-for-weight-management-an-obesity-medicine-physician-explains-the-seismic-shift-taking-place-208174\">BMI is an imperfect measure</a>, to be sure,  but most medical organizations consider a person with a <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media/docs/bmi_tbl.pdf\">BMI greater than 30</a> to have obesity.</p>\n\n<p>Between television commercials, advertisements on social media and suggestions from family and friends, Americans are bombarded by approaches to losing weight. For many of these approaches, there’s little to no evidence showing they successfully help people lose weight. However, extensive and rigorous research supports the use of GLP-1s for treating obesity. Studies show that these medications can reliably <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/glp-1-drugs-effective-weight-loss-more-independent-studies-needed\">help people lose about 15% of their body weight</a> in six to 12 months. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Tuna fish salad with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, egg and pickled onion in eco paper box container.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Evidence-based approaches for weight loss include GLP-1 drugs, surgical treatment and behavior changes such as adopting a healthier diet.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/tuna-fish-salad-with-lettuce-cherry-tomatoes-royalty-free-image/2153923295\">Alexandr Kolesnikov/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There are two other evidence based-approaches. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000517\">Lifestyle changes</a>, such as consuming fewer calories and increasing physical activity, can help people lose about 5% of their weight in the same period of time. With surgical treatment, now referred to as metabolic and bariatric surgery, patients can achieve a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000550\">loss of about 30% of their body weight</a> after about 18 months.</p>\n\n<p>Which of these treatment approaches is appropriate for a given person depends on their circumstances and is best discussed with their health care provider. But in my experience, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03352-y\">too few health care professionals refer their patients</a> to any of these therapies. </p>\n\n<h2>Addressing the cost barrier</h2>\n\n<p>According to a November 2025 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-prescription-drug-costs-views-on-trump-administration-actions-and-glp-1-use/\">1 in 8 adults in the U.S. have tried a GLP-1 medication</a>. That may sound like a lot, but given that <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/159281\">more than 40% of American adults</a> have obesity, it may not be enough. </p>\n\n<p>In clinical trials, people taking GLP-1 drugs to treat obesity generally <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349\">maintained their weight loss for a year</a> if they stayed on the medication. However, participants in the trials did not have to pay for the medications. Research suggests that more than half of people using the drugs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.70058\">stop taking them after six months</a>, most often because they can’t afford them.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government’s deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/trump-medicare-coverage-weight-loss-drugs/87122843007/\">aims to address this barrier</a>. </p>\n\n<p>GLP-1 drugs currently cost more than US$1,000 per month for people unable to get them covered by health insurance – and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fewer-1-5-large-companies-health-plans-cover-weight-loss-drugs-survey-rcna174345\">many insurance plans do not</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/\">Nov. 6 White House announcement</a>, starting in early 2026, certain GLP-1 drugs covered by the agreement will be available for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/weight-loss-drugs-medicare-deals\">$350 per month or less</a> through an online marketplace the government plans to launch.</p>\n\n<p>Some drugs will be as cheap as $150, according to the announcement. Companies will also drop the amount that Medicare and Medicaid pay for them, and certain Medicare patients would be able to access them with a $50 co-pay. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/17/novo-nordisk-cuts-prices-ozempic-wegovy/87269159007/\">These prices are still in flux</a>, news reports suggest. However, for most Americans, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/trump-medicare-coverage-weight-loss-drugs/87122843007/\">paying even $150 a month</a> for a single medication remains a budget buster. That’s especially true given that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00398-7\">people from lower socioeconomic groups</a> experience higher rates of obesity and often have other related health conditions that require costly medications.</p>\n\n<p>These costs are not temporary. Most patients with obesity and related health problems will likely need to use these medications indefinitely. According to emerging research, people who stop taking them typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14725\">regain the weight they lost</a>. Realistically, very few people who take GLP-1 drugs can maintain their weight loss with lifestyle changes alone.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pile of injectors for GLP-1 weight loss drugs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Studies suggest that patients who use GLP-1 drugs for weight loss will likely have to use them indefinitely.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/large-group-of-injectors-dosing-pens-for-royalty-free-image/2025837738\">aprott/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Beyond cost</h2>\n\n<p>The reduced pricing for GLP-1 drugs is an important first step in increasing affordability and access to these treatments. Given that the food environments people live in make it difficult to make healthy choices, I believe that this move will only meaningfully benefit the health of all Americans if it is combined with other policy changes.</p>\n\n<p>While several countries have a <a href=\"https://impact.economist.com/health/obesity-response-index/global\">national plan to prevent and treat obesity</a>, the U.S. does not. Instead, American public health policies are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.621\">largely set state by state</a>. They often include strategies such as free school meals for children or more robust insurance coverage for treating obesity and related health conditions. However, most such policies are often too narrow to have significant benefits at the population level. </p>\n\n<p>Broader policy shifts and legislation targeting obesity prevention could move the needle. </p>\n\n<p>For example, research is increasingly showing that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-024-00517-z\">ultraprocessed foods</a> play a role in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food\">promoting weight gain</a> and potentially other diseases, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.4777\">colorectal cancer</a>. Legislators could draw on that research to better regulate these foods – for example, to limit the use of certain especially harmful ingredients, to restrict marketing of ultraprocessed products, or to limit their inclusion in school meals.</p>\n\n<p>Another policy change that may help would be to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1205880\">build more extensive nutrition education</a> into the training that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/diet-related-diseases-are-the-no-1-cause-of-death-in-the-us-yet-many-doctors-receive-little-to-no-nutrition-education-in-med-school-236217\">medical students</a> and other health care providers receive. This may better position the next generation of clinicians to help their patients make the healthiest choices to maintain their weight and health.  </p>\n\n<p>These and other policy changes will be critically important in efforts to reduce the rate of obesity among Americans in the future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269361/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David B.

      "content": "<p>In late October 2025, as much as <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/ludicrous-usd6-billion-counter-strike-2-skins-market-crashes-loses-usd3-billion-overnight-game-update-destroys-inventories-collapses-market\">US$2 billion</a> vanished from a digital marketplace. This wasn’t a hack or a bubble bursting. It happened because one company, Valve, <a href=\"https://www.kvue.com/article/news/nation-world/counter-strike-2-online-market-crash/507-ae9be038-2833-49d4-a5b4-d8f24fd0b33c\">changed the rules for its video game</a> Counter-Strike 2, a popular first-person shooter with a global player base of nearly <a href=\"https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2\">30 million monthly users</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For years, its players have bought, sold and traded digital cosmetic items, known as “skins.” Some rare items, particularly knives and gloves, commanded high prices in real-world money – <a href=\"https://skinswap.com/blog/en/cs2/the-most-expensive-knife/\">up to $1.5 million</a> – leading some gamers to treat the market like an <a href=\"https://blix.gg/news/cs-2/how-to-make-money-with-cs2-skins-in-2025/\">investment portfolio</a>. As a result, many investment-style analytics websites charge monthly fees for financial insight, trends and transaction data from this digital marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>In one fell swoop, Valve unilaterally changed the game. It expanded the “<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662005\">trade up contract</a>,” allowing players to exchange – or “trade up” – a number of their common assets into knives or gloves.</p>\n\n<p>By flipping this switch, Valve instantly upended digital scarcity. The market was flooded with new supply, and the value of existing high-end items collapsed. Prices plummeted, initially erasing half the market’s total value, which exceeded $6 billion before the recent crash. Although a partial recovery brought the net loss to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/counter-strike-2-update-market-crash-2-billion-dollars/\">roughly 25%</a>, significant volatility continues, leaving investors unsure whether the bottom has truly fallen out.</p>\n\n<p>Many of those who saw their digital fortunes evaporate immediately wondered whether there was anything they could do to get their money back. Speaking as a <a href=\"https://law.indiana.edu/about/people/details?name=marinotti-jo%C3%A3o\">law professor</a> and a gamer myself, the answer isn’t what they want to hear: no. In fact, the existing legal structure largely protects Valve’s ability to engage in this sort of digital market manipulation. Players and investors were simply out of luck. </p>\n\n<p>The Counter-Strike 2 crash reveals a troubling reality that extends far beyond video games: Corporations have built exchange-scale investment markets governed primarily by private terms-of-service agreements, rather than the robust set of public regulations that oversee traditional financial and consumer markets. These digital economies occupy a legal blind spot, lacking the fundamental guardrails of property rights, meaningful consumer protection or even securities regulation.</p>\n\n<h2>Your digital ‘property’ isn’t really yours</h2>\n\n<p>If you spend real money on a digital item, it may feel like you should own it. Legally, you don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The digital economy is built on a crucial distinction between ownership and licensing. When users sign up for Steam, Valve’s platform, they agree to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251109151751/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/\">Steam subscriber agreement</a>. Buried in that contract is a critical piece of legalese stating that all digital assets and services provided by Valve, including the Counter-Strike 2 skins, are merely “licensed, not sold.” The license granted to users “confers no title or ownership” at all. This isn’t meaningless corporate jargon; it’s a legal standard <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol54/iss1/2/\">routinely affirmed</a> by U.S. courts.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implication is clear: Because players only license their skins, they have no property rights over them. When Valve changed the game’s mechanics in a way that collapsed the items’ market value, it didn’t steal, damage or destroy anyone’s “property.” In the eyes of the law, Valve simply altered the conditions of a license, something that its terms-of-service agreement allows it to do unilaterally, at any time, for any reason.</p>\n\n<h2>Consumer protection laws don’t apply</h2>\n\n<p>While the Counter-Strike 2 crash may seem like a violation of consumer rights, current laws are ill-equipped to handle this type of corporate behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have begun addressing concerns about digital goods, primarily focusing on instances where purchased movies or games disappear entirely from user libraries. For example, California recently enacted <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB2426/id/3022416\">AB 2426</a>. This law requires transparency, prohibiting terms like “buy” or “purchase” unless the consumer confirms that they understand they will receive only a revocable license.</p>\n\n<p>As commendable as this law is, it protects only against confusion and loss of access, not loss of market value when platforms rebalance virtual economies. Valve can comply with consumer transparency laws and still adjust the supply of digital items, rendering them valueless overnight. Ultimately, current consumer protection laws are designed to ensure users know what they are licensing. They do not, however, create ownership interests or protect the speculative value of those digital items.</p>\n\n<h2>Game items are treated like unregulated stocks</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most significant legal vacuum is the absence of financial regulation. The Counter-Strike 2 economy, a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/market-for-counter-strike-2-digital-items-hits-all-time-high\">multibillion-dollar ecosystem</a> with <a href=\"https://cs2fund.com/top-investors/\">dedicated investors</a> and <a href=\"https://totalcsgo.com/skins/skin-trading-sites\">third-party cash markets</a>, looks and behaves like a traditional financial market. Yet, it remains outside the purview of any financial regulator, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Under U.S. law, the primary standard for determining whether an asset should be governed as a security is the Howey test. According to this <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/293/\">Supreme Court precedent</a>, an asset is a security if it meets four criteria. Securities involve an “investment of money” in a “common enterprise” with a reasonable expectation of “profits” derived from the “efforts of others.” </p>\n\n<p>Counter-Strike 2 skins arguably meet all of these criteria. Participants invest real money in a common enterprise – Valve’s platform – with an expectation of profit. Crucially, that profit depends on the “efforts of others.” The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/divisions-offices/division-corporation-finance/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\">SEC notes</a> this prong is met when a promoter provides “essential managerial efforts” that affect the enterprise’s success. Valve controls the game’s development, manages the platform and – as the recent update proves – dictates item supply and scarcity.</p>\n\n<p>If a publicly traded company unilaterally changed its rules in a way that predictably tanked the price of its own shares, regulators would immediately investigate for market manipulation. So how can Valve get away with this? Three things cut against the skins’ status as securities. </p>\n\n<p>First is their “consumptive intent” – skins are primarily game cosmetics. Second, there’s no way to convert the skins into dollars within Valve’s own ecosystem. In other words, third-party markets allow users to cash out, but these markets operate outside Valve’s own immediate control. And finally, the Howey test generally governs assets, such as stocks and bonds, that grant investors enforceable rights. Valve’s licensing scheme attempts to circumvent this by ensuring players hold nothing but a revocable license.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the $2 billion crash is a wake-up call. As digital economies grow in financial significance, society must decide: Will these markets continue to be governed solely by private corporate contracts? Or will they require integration into more robust legal frameworks, such as securities regulation, consumer protection and property law?</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268749/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>João Marinotti does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The Cold War presented one such moment in American history, when the freedom of political expression collided with <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/age-of-eisenhower/mcarthyism-red-scare\">paranoia over communist infiltration</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 1947, the <a href=\"https://guides.bpl.org/Congress/HUAC\">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/hollywood-ten-men-who-refused-839762/\">subpoenaed 10 screenwriters and directors</a> to testify about their union membership and alleged communist associations. Labeled the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hollywood-Ten\">Hollywood Ten</a>, the defiant witnesses – Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Adrian Scott and Dalton Trumbo – refused to answer questions on First Amendment grounds. During his dramatic testimony, Lawson proclaimed his intent “to fight for the Bill of Rights,” which he argued the committee “was trying to destroy.”</p>\n\n<p>They were <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/24/the-day-in-politics-nov-24-1947-259367?_amp=true\">all cited for contempt of Congress</a>. Eight were sentenced to a year in federal prison, and two received six-month terms. Upon their release, they <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/blacklists/\">faced blacklisting in the industry</a>. Some, like writer Dalton Trumbo, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240613-i-went-spectacularly-broke-the-blacklisted-hollywood-writer-who-won-two-oscars\">temporarily left the country</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bcwVQdgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">researcher focused on the cultural cold war</a>, I have examined the role the First Amendment played in the anti-communist hearings during the 1940s and ’50s. </p>\n\n<p>The conviction and incarceration of the Hollywood Ten left a <a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/congcomms.html\">chilling effect on subsequent witnesses</a> called to appear before congressional committees. It also established a period of repression historians now refer to as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.013.6\">Second Red Scare</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Although the freedom of speech is enshrined in the Constitution and prized by Americans, the story of the Second Red Scare shows that this freedom is even more fragile than it may now seem.</p>\n\n<h2>The Fifth Amendment communists</h2>\n\n<p>After the 1947 hearings, the term “<a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/congcomms.html\">unfriendly</a>” became a label applied by the House Un-American Activities Committee and the press to the Hollywood Ten and any witnesses who refused to cooperate with the committee. These witnesses, who wanted to avoid the fate of the Hollywood Ten, began to shift away from the First Amendment as a legal strategy. </p>\n\n<p>They chose instead to plead the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/\">Fifth Amendment</a>, which grants people the right to protect themselves from self-incrimination. Many prominent artists during the 1950s, including playwright <a href=\"https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_8006316.pdf\">Lillian Hellman</a> and singer and activist <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/75-years-ago-the-kkk-and-anti-communists-teamed-up-to-violently-stop-a-folk-concert-in-ny-236094\">Paul Robeson</a>, opted to invoke the Fifth when called before the committee and asked about their political affiliations.  </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/house-un-american-activities-committee/\">Fifth Amendment shielded hundreds</a> of “unfriendly” witnesses from imprisonment, including artists, teachers and federal workers. However, it did not save them from <a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/schrecker-blacklist.html\">job loss and blacklisting</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While they could avoid contempt citations by pleading the Fifth, they could not erase the stain of perceived guilt. This legal approach became so widespread that <a href=\"https://www2.gwu.edu/%7Eerpapers/mep/displaydoc.cfm?docid=erpn-josmcc\">U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy</a>, the country’s leading anti-communist crusader, disparaged these witnesses as “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/mccarthy-more-than-just-a-man/\">Fifth Amendment Communists</a>” and boasted of purging their ranks from the federal government. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three photos of a man in suit and tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Three portraits of Albert Einstein taken in Princeton, N.J., in March 1953.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/USASCIENCEALBERTEINSTEIN/cd78c06cede2da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From Fifth back to First</h2>\n\n<p>In 1953, the physicist Albert Einstein became instrumental in <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/albert-einstein/\">revitalizing the force of the First Amendment</a> as a rhetorical and legal tactic in the congressional hearings. Having fled Germany after the Nazis came to power, Einstein took a position at Princeton in 1933 and became an important voice in American politics.</p>\n\n<p>Einstein’s philosophical battle against McCarthyism began with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/19/archives/teacher-advised-by-einstein-is-out-brooklyn-man-instructed-not-to.html\">a letter to a Brooklyn high school teacher</a> named William Frauenglass. </p>\n\n<p>In April of that year, Frauenglass was subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, “<a href=\"https://libguides.ecu.edu/c.php?g=17484&amp;p=97626\">the Senate counterpart</a>” of the House Un-American Activities Committee, to testify about his involvement in an intercultural education seminar. After the hearing, in which Frauenglass declined to speak about his political affiliations, he risked potential termination from his position and wrote to Einstein seeking support. </p>\n\n<p>In his response, Einstein urged Frauenglass and all intellectuals to enact a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">revolutionary” form of complete “noncooperation</a>” with the committee.</p>\n\n<p>While Einstein advised noncompliance, he also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">acknowledged the potential risk</a>: “Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify, i.e., he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country.”</p>\n\n<p>Frauenglass shared his story with the press, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">Einstein’s letter was published in full</a> in The New York Times on June 12, 1953. It was also quoted in local papers around the country. </p>\n\n<p>One week later, Frauenglass was fired from his job.</p>\n\n<p>After learning about Einstein’s public position, McCarthy labeled the Nobel laureate “<a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2017/einstein-mccarthyism\">an enemy of America</a>.” That didn’t stop Einstein’s campaign for freedom of expression. He continued to encourage witnesses to rely on the First Amendment. </p>\n\n<p>When the engineer <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,858395-2,00.html\">Albert Shadowitz received a subpoena in 1953</a> to appear before McCarthy’s Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, to answer questions about alleged ties to the Communist Party, he traveled to Einstein’s home to seek out the physicist’s advice. After consulting with Einstein, Shadowitz opted for the First Amendment over the Fifth Amendment. </p>\n\n<p>On Dec. 16, 1953, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Proceedings_Against_Albert_Shadowitz_for/hvNapASYWBkC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">Shadowitz informed the committee</a> that he had received counsel from Einstein. He then voiced his opposition to the hearing on the grounds of the First Amendment: “I will refuse to answer any question which invades my rights to think as I please or which violates my guarantees of free speech and association.”</p>\n\n<p>He was cited for contempt in August 1954 and indicted that November, facing a potential year in prison and US$1,000 fine. As an indicator of McCarthy’s diminishing power, the charge was thrown out in July 1955 by a federal judge.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Black man sits in front of a table with a microphone on it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Singer Paul Robeson appears before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C., in 1956.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/singer-paul-robeson-is-shown-as-he-appeared-before-the-news-photo/515025440?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Bettmann Archive/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The triumph of dissent</h2>\n\n<p>Well-known public figures also began to turn away from the Fifth Amendment as a legal tactic and to draw on the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>In August 1955, when the <a href=\"https://peteseeger.org/\">folk musician Pete Seeger</a> testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he voiced his rejection of the Fifth Amendment defense during the hearing. Seeger asserted that he wanted to use his testimony to call into question the nature of the inquiry altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Pleading the protection of the First Amendment, <a href=\"https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6457/\">Seeger refused</a> “to answer any questions” related to his “political beliefs” and instead interrogated the committee’s right to ask such questions “under such compulsion as this.”</p>\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/excerpts-from-arthur-millers-testimony-before-the-house-un-american-activities-committee/14006/\">playwright Arthur Miller</a> was subpoenaed by the committee in 1956, he also refused to invoke the Fifth. Both were cited for contempt. Seeger was sentenced to a year in prison. Miller was given the option to pay a $500 dollar fine or spend 30 days in jail.</p>\n\n<p>As Seeger and Miller fought their appeals in court, McCarthy’s popularity continued to wane, and public sentiment began to shift. </p>\n\n<p>Prompted by Einstein, the noncompliant witnesses in the 1950s reshaped the public discussion, refocusing the conversation on the importance of freedom of expression rather than the fears of imagined communist infiltration. </p>\n\n<p>Although the First Amendment failed to keep the Hollywood Ten out of prison, it ultimately prevailed. Unlike the Hollywood Ten, both Miller and Seeger won their appeals. Miller spent no time in prison and Seeger only one day in jail. Miller’s conviction was reversed in 1958, Seeger’s in 1962. The Second Red Scare was over. </p>\n\n<p>As the Second Red Scare shows, when free speech is under attack, strategic compliance may be useful for individuals. However, bold and courageous acts of dissent are critical for protecting First Amendment rights for everyone.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267809/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I met Pete Seeger personally while directing a documentary film about his environmental legacy. </span></em></p>",

Through three elections, <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/11/13/trump-election-farming-counties-trade-war/\">farmers stood by Trump</a> even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.</p>\n\n<p>But Trump’s second term may be different.</p>\n\n<p>A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods – not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive – through renewed <a href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/lower-tariffs-take-effect-under-new-china-trade-deal\">tariffs on agricultural products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/potential-implications-of-immigration-restrictions-on-the-u-s-agricultural-workforce/\">visa restrictions on farm workers</a>, <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2025/04/04/small-farms/\">reduced farm subsidies</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/misguided-cattlemens-trade-group-raises-alarm-trump-plan/story?id=126792026\">open favoritism</a> toward South American agricultural competitors.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018–19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqae141\">farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans</a> even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/most-us-farmers-remain-loyal-to-trump-despite-pain-from-trade-wars-and-covid-19-146535\">political belief outweighed market logic</a> – at least in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper – and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.</p>\n\n<h2>Tariffs: The familiar pain returns</h2>\n\n<p>The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-suspends-soybean-imports-three-us-firms-halts-log-imports-2025-03-04/\">Beijing suspended import licenses</a> for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.</p>\n\n<p>An October 2025 deal promised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-vows-boost-us-farm-trade-leaves-details-unclear-2025-10-30/\">China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans</a> a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic. </p>\n\n<p>Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-misses-out-billions-dollars-china-soybean-sales-midway-through-peak-season-2025-09-10/\">long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina</a>, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.</p>\n\n<p>Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/partners-usda-data-dump-shows-minimal-soybean-sales-to-china-11850553\">storing record volumes of unsold soybeans</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-700r\">over $23 billion in bailout payments</a> to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/trump-trade-farm-aid-bailout-00002333\">little appetite for another bailout</a>. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/10/usda-transfers-13b-slush-fund-future-tariff-relief/409198/\">funds for farm relief are running low</a>, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People walk among rows of plants.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702587/original/file-20251114-66-t7yk8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Immigrants are a key labor force on U.S. farms.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/migrant-workers-pick-strawberries-during-harvest-south-of-news-photo/2149253017\">Visions of America/Joe Sohm/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs</h2>\n\n<p>Farms are also short of workers. <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=63466\">Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers</a> lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2025/10/29/trumps-deportations-are-causing-farm-labor-issues-he-hasnt-presented-a-viable-long-term-solution/\">Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing</a> have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging.

What hasn’t received as much attention is employers using generative AI to assess workers’ psychological well-being and provide emotional support in the workplace. </p>\n\n<p>Since the pandemic-induced global shift to remote work, industries ranging from <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030110042/en/OneDigital-Resourcing-Edge-Partners-with-Wysa-to-Provide-AI-Powered-Mental-Health-Support-for-Employees\">health care</a> to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030110042/en/OneDigital-Resourcing-Edge-Partners-with-Wysa-to-Provide-AI-Powered-Mental-Health-Support-for-Employees\">human resources</a> and <a href=\"https://insight7.io/6-ai-tools-that-detect-tone-emotion-in-calls/\">customer service</a> have seen a spike in employers <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-future-of-employee-monitoring\">using AI-powered systems</a> designed to analyze the emotional state of employees, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240415230248/en/AI-Detects-82-of-Mental-Health-App-Users-in-Crisis-Finds-Wysa\">identify emotionally distressed individuals</a>, and provide them with emotional support.</p>\n\n<p>This new frontier is a large step beyond using general chat tools or <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394482280_Artificial_Empathy_Evaluating_AI_Emotional_Support_Systems_in_Organizations\">individual therapy apps</a> for psychological support. As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=z_A4SqoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">researchers studying</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=c3Iu5qsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">how AI affects emotions</a> and relationships in the workplace, we are concerned with critical questions that this shift raises: What happens when your employer has access to your emotional data? Can AI really provide the kind of emotional support workers need? What happens if the AI malfunctions? And if something goes wrong, who’s responsible?</p>\n\n<h2>The workplace difference</h2>\n\n<p>Many companies have started by offering automated counseling programs that have many parallels with personal therapy apps, a practice that has shown some benefits. In preliminary studies, researchers found that in a doctor-patient-style virtual conversation setting, AI-generated responses actually <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838\">make people feel more heard</a> than human ones. A study comparing AI chatbots with human psychotherapists found the bots were “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12832\">at least as empathic as therapist responses, and sometimes more so</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>This might seem surprising at first glance, but AI offers unwavering attention and consistently supportive responses. It doesn’t interrupt, doesn’t judge and doesn’t get frustrated when you repeat the same concerns. For some employees, especially those dealing with stigmatized issues like mental health or workplace conflicts, this consistency <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.043\">feels safer than human interaction</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But for others, it raises new concerns. A 2023 study found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1219229\">workers were reluctant to participate</a> in company-initiated mental health programs due to worries about confidentiality and stigma. Many feared that their disclosures could negatively affect their careers.</p>\n\n<p>Other workplace AI systems go much deeper, analyzing employee communication as it happens – think emails, Slack conversations and Zoom calls. This analysis creates detailed records of employee emotional states, stress patterns and psychological vulnerabilities. All this data resides within corporate systems where privacy protections are typically unclear and often favor the interests of the employer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"illustration of a giant eyeball watching a woman working on a computer at a desk\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Employees might feel that AI emotional support systems are more like workplace surveillance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/large-blue-eyeball-watching-businesswoman-royalty-free-illustration/2169079877\">Malte Mueller/fStop via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Workplace Options, a global employee assistance provider, has partnered with Wellbeing.ai to <a href=\"https://www.workplaceoptions.com/news/workplace-options-partnership-with-wellbeing-ai-deepens-human-connection-via-evidence-based-neuroscience/\">deploy a platform that uses facial analytics</a> to track emotional states across 62 emotion categories. It generates well-being scores that organizations can use to detect stress or morale issues. This approach effectively embeds AI into emotionally sensitive aspects of work, leaving an uncomfortably thin boundary between support and surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>In this scenario, the same AI that helps employees feel heard and supported also generates unprecedented insight into workforce emotional dynamics. Organizations can now track which departments show signs of burnout, identify employees at risk of quitting and monitor emotional responses to organizational changes.</p>\n\n<p>But this type of tool also transforms emotional data into management intelligence, presenting many companies with a genuine dilemma. While progressive organizations are establishing strict data governance – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3610207\">limiting access to anonymized patterns</a> rather than individual conversations – others struggle with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580950\">the temptation to use emotional insights</a> for performance evaluation and personnel decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous surveillance carried out by some of these systems may help ensure that companies do not neglect a group or individual in distress, but it can also lead people to monitor their own actions to avoid calling attention to themselves. Research on workplace AI monitoring has shown how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12514\">employees experience increased stress and modify their behavior</a> when they know that management can review their interactions. The monitoring undermines the feeling of safety necessary for people to comfortably seek help. Another study found that these systems <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23294965241228874\">increased distress for employees</a> due to the loss of privacy and concerns that consequences would arise if the system identified them as being stressed or burned out. </p>\n\n<h2>When artificial empathy meets real consequences</h2>\n\n<p>These findings are important because the stakes are arguably even higher in workplace settings than personal ones. AI systems lack the nuanced judgment necessary to distinguish between accepting someone as a person versus endorsing harmful behaviors. In organizational contexts, this means an AI might inadvertently validate unethical workplace practices or fail to recognize when human intervention is critical. </p>\n\n<p>And that’s not the only way AI systems can get things wrong. A study found that emotion-tracking AI tools had a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emotion-tracking-ai-on-the-job-workers-fear-being-watched-and-misunderstood-222592\">disproportionate impact</a> on employees of color, trans and gender nonbinary people, and people living with mental illness. Interviewees <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emotion-tracking-ai-on-the-job-workers-fear-being-watched-and-misunderstood-222592\">expressed deep concern</a> about how these tools might misread an employee’s mood, tone or verbal queues due to ethnic, gender and other kinds of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/forget-dystopian-scenarios-ai-is-pervasive-today-and-the-risks-are-often-hidden-218222\">bias that AI systems carry</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q29YVnHqEt0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A study looked at how employees perceive AI emotion detection in the workplace.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There’s also an authenticity problem. Research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2024.100745\">when people know they’re talking to an AI system</a>, they rate identical empathetic responses as less authentic than when they attribute them to humans. Yet some employees prefer AI precisely because they know it’s not human. The feeling that these tools protect your anonymity and freedom from social consequences is appealing for some – even if it may only be a feeling.</p>\n\n<p>The technology also raises questions about what happens to human managers. If employees consistently prefer AI for emotional support, what does that reveal about organizational leadership? Some companies are <a href=\"https://pandatron.ai/ai-in-leadership-development-the-next-frontier/\">using AI insights to train managers</a> in emotional intelligence, turning the technology into a mirror that reflects where human skills fall short.</p>\n\n<h2>The path forward</h2>\n\n<p>The conversation about workplace AI emotional support isn’t just about technology – it’s about what kinds of companies people want to work for. As these systems become more prevalent, we believe it’s important to grapple with fundamental questions: Should employers prioritize authentic human connection over consistent availability? How can individual privacy be balanced with organizational insights? Can organizations harness AI’s empathetic capabilities while preserving the trust necessary for meaningful workplace relationships?</p>\n\n<p>The most thoughtful implementations recognize that AI shouldn’t replace human empathy, but rather create conditions where it can flourish. When AI handles routine emotional labor – the 3 a.m. anxiety attacks, pre-meeting stress checks, processing difficult feedback – managers gain bandwidth for deeper, more authentic connections with their teams.</p>\n\n<p>But this requires careful implementation. Companies that establish clear ethical boundaries, strong privacy protections and explicit policies about how emotional data gets used are more likely to avoid the pitfalls of these systems – as will those that recognize when human judgment and authentic presence remain irreplaceable.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266570/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>By now, Americans know the strange math of minting: Each penny costs about <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cost-of-a-penny-nickel-dime-e38975c6811ad38ac0a986c8fccf3a4a\">4 cents to make</a>. Chances are you have some in a jar, or scattered among pockets, purses and car ashtrays.</p>\n\n<p>As small as it is, the penny punches above its weight culturally. If it ever disappeared, so too might the simple kindness of “<a href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/take-a-penny-leave-a-penny-day/\">take a penny, leave a penny</a>,” alongside <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html\">timeless classics like penny loafers</a> and the tradition of tossing a penny in a fountain.</p>\n\n<p>But the penny’s days are indeed numbered. The U.S. Mint <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380\">pressed the last 1-cent coin on Nov. 12</a>, 2025, following a directive from the White House. While pennies will remain legal tender, old ones will gradually be taken out of circulation.</p>\n\n<p>The impact of this change will reach beyond coin jars. Its ripples will be felt as small, cash-reliant Main Street merchants face another test of adaptability in a system that increasingly favors scale, technology and plastic. It will also be felt by people who rely on cash – often people <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-08/cash-only.pdf\">without bank accounts</a> who have the least room to absorb even tiny shifts in price. </p>\n\n<p>My interest comes from my former lives as the chief financial officer of a large credit union and as a small-business owner. Now, I bridge theory and practice as a professor – or “prac-ademic,” as I like to say – <a href=\"https://web.uri.edu/business/meet/nancy-forster-holt/\">studying the challenges facing Main Street businesses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the penny goes away, some will win, some will lose – and for some, it’ll be a coin toss. </p>\n\n<h2>Heads, they win</h2>\n\n<p>The first and most obvious winner is the U.S. government, which will save <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/penny-out-of-circulation-mint-rcna243486\">tens of millions of dollars each year</a> by no longer minting a coin that costs more to make than it’s worth. Ending production seems like an easy call for efficiency’s sake.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/banking-trends-strategies/what-bankers-should-think-about-the-end-of-the-u-s-penny-192144\">Banks and credit unions</a> will likely benefit too. Pennies are disproportionately expensive to handle: Every bag of pennies gets counted, sorted, rolled, verified and shipped back to the Federal Reserve, generating labor and equipment costs that <a href=\"https://us.brinks.com/-/the-true-costs-of-manual-cash-management-1\">far exceed the coin’s value</a>. Removing the smallest denomination strips out an entire layer of cost and friction from bank operations – savings that scale immediately across thousands of branches.</p>\n\n<p>Another beneficiary, this one hiding in plain sight, is who transports the cash: the <a href=\"https://www.readycreditcorp.com/resources/blog/the-penny-is-disappearing-and-so-are-the-profits-of-handling-cash/\">armored-carrier industry</a>. For companies such as Loomis and Brink’s, pennies are heavy, low-value cargo, and a logistical money-loser. Removing penny pickups eliminates one of their most inefficient services, reducing fuel use, labor hours and truck wear. </p>\n\n<p>Large retailers will likely also win. Size and scale make it easier to undertake <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/penny-circulation-retailers-change.html\">preparations both big and small</a>, such as reprogramming cash registers and stockpiling pennies to hedge against shortages. Larger companies also have the talent and bandwidth to <a href=\"https://www.ihlservices.com/product/the-cost-of-cash-handling\">figure out the true costs and benefits</a> of accepting cash or noncash payments. If most of their transactions are <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/retailers-return-on-store-tech-investments/805305/\">already digital</a>, they could be relatively indifferent to the end of the penny.</p>\n\n<p>Large retailers also negotiate <a href=\"https://goftx.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees-guide/\">lower card processing rates</a>, which are the fees <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">merchants must pay to the card companies</a> every time a customer uses a credit or debit card. These rates aren’t uniform: Large chains get discounted pricing <a href=\"https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/can-a-large-merchants-negotiate-lower-payment-processing-rates/\">based on sales volume</a>, while small businesses face higher costs for identical transactions. It follows that any policy change leading to more people paying with plastic will disproportionately benefit larger retailers.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, some banks, credit unions and large retailers have <a href=\"https://massmarketretailers.com/retailers-facing-penny-shortages-call-for-federal-action/\">expressed concern and surprise</a> at the pace of the change and the lack of guidance from the federal government. But for most, the penny’s end is a minor operational footnote. Online-only businesses operate in this frictionless world as well – no coins, no counting, no issue.</p>\n\n<h2>Tails, they lose</h2>\n\n<p>For small, Main Street businesses, the penny’s disappearance highlights the structural disadvantages they already face – and I think it will force a reckoning about what types of payments benefit their bottom lines.</p>\n\n<p>As pennies phase out, local businesses are likely to round cash transactions to the nearest 5 cents, resulting in what economists call a “<a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-27\">rounding tax</a>.” Rounding to the nearest nickel could cost businesses and consumers about $6 million annually, according to researchers with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.</p>\n\n<p>And it wouldn’t offer much relief if more shoppers turn to plastic and other noncash payments. That’s because most small merchants lack the negotiating power to lower their <a href=\"https://goftx.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees-guide/\">card-processing fees</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Card acceptance comes with a layered stack of costs for merchants: interchange fees, network assessments, processor markups, gateway fees, chargeback penalties, terminal rentals and more. Together, these average <a href=\"https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/can-a-large-merchants-negotiate-lower-payment-processing-rates/\">2.5% to 3.5% per sale for many small businesses</a>. Also, there are expenses related to adopting the latest, greatest payment methods, and then keeping them updated.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a quick-service restaurant where a typical customer spends $14. If that customer pays with a credit card and the business pays an <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/2024/making-sense-of-the-cost-of-cash-for-businesses/\">average processing fee</a> of 2.2% plus 10 cents per transaction, each sale incurs about 41 cents in fees. Even low-cost debit cards include fixed per-transaction charges that disproportionately affect businesses when the per-sale average is small. When the average sale is $10 or less, it <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">barely covers the cost</a> to process it as a card transaction. </p>\n\n<p>That said, handling cash also comes at a cost, and <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-hidden-costs-of-cash\">it’s not always easy</a> <a href=\"https://www.ihlservices.com/product/the-cost-of-cash-handling\">to know what’s best for business</a>. One analysis found that accepting cash <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/fed-notes/2019/08/cash-me-if-you-can-impacts-of-cashless-businesses-on-retailers-consumers-cash-use/\">costs 53 cents per $100 of sales</a>, compared with $1.12 for accepting debit payments using a signature and 81 cents for PIN-based debit. Of course, businesses also should keep in mind that different customers will have different payment preferences.</p>\n\n<p>And speaking of customers, those who are most likely to feel the pinch from the end of the penny are people who still rely on cash: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/health/elderly-cash-electronic-payments.html\">older adults</a>, lower-income households, people without credit cards or bank accounts – <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-08/cash-only.pdf\">either unbanked or under-banked</a> – and people who budget in cash because it provides firmer spending discipline. </p>\n\n<p>A few cents added to a grocery total or a convenience store purchase may not matter to someone tapping a rewards credit card, but cash-dependent consumers experience those small increases directly, with no offsetting points, perks or end-of-month cash back. And yes, prices often end in 99 cents, which get <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/blogs/macroblog/2025/11/03/rounding-rules-and-cash-inflation-when-we-no-longer-make-cents\">rounded up, not down</a>. So the burden falls disproportionately on those least equipped to absorb even small, cumulative increases. </p>\n\n<h2>For some, it’s a coin toss</h2>\n\n<p>Digital-first consumers may barely notice the penny’s disappearance. They tap phones, scan QR codes and use payment apps that will still <a href=\"https://www.windriverpayments.com/how-will-discontinuing-the-penny-affect-my-business-and-payment-processing\">settle to the exact amount</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While businesses haven’t received final guidance on how to handle payments in the post-penny era, <a href=\"https://www.windriverpayments.com/how-will-discontinuing-the-penny-affect-my-business-and-payment-processing/\">one option</a> is to price electronic transactions to the cent and round cash transactions to the nearest nickel. If that were widely adopted, digital payments alone would remain precise.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers who use cashless payments may believe their choice doesn’t affect how they shop, but behavioral research says otherwise. <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/experts/how-credit-cards-activate-reward-center-our-brains-and-drive-spending\">Credit cards reduce the “pain of paying,”</a> leading people to spend more – often 10% to 20% more than with cash. Credit card rewards programs further incentivize card use. In one last nod to the cost of noncash payments, those rewards are funded by higher merchant fees that ultimately <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">translate into higher retail prices</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Killing the penny makes economic sense for the government and some businesses, yet it also highlights a deeper truth: Efficiency tends to reward the already efficient. For many, however, even when the change is small, every cent still counts.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267380/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nancy Forster-Holt does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But the University of Michigan’s healthy minds survey, the <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/news/2025posts/college-student-mental-health-third-consecutive-year-improvement.html\">country’s largest student mental health study</a> to date, recently found that college students are reporting lower rates of depressive symptoms, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for the third year in a row.</p>\n\n<p>Conducted in 2024 and 2025 and surveying more than 84,000 students across 135 American colleges and universities, the study finds that <a href=\"https://healthymindsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-2025_HMS-National-Data-Report_Student.pdf\">severe depression symptoms</a> among college students dropped in the past two years to 18% – down from 23% who said they experienced severe depression in 2022.

Understanding the root causes of students’ stress is an important precursor for schools to come up with effective ways to help students manage their anxiety and succeed in school. </p>\n\n<p>But even when schools offer extensive mental health support programs, students occasionally need to take a break to focus on their health and well-being. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past 10 years, I have reviewed and approved medical withdrawals for 133 students at Babson College. From fall 2015 to early spring 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, an average of 12 students per year left on medical leave out of the nearly 4,000 students enrolled at the school. </p>\n\n<p>The average number of students taking medical leave then increased by about two people a year from fall 2020 through 2025. Approximately 82% of these cases are mental health-related.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly 70% of these students ultimately return to campus and eventually graduate. In general, very few students who take a leave of absence from school end up returning. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are some schools that use proactive, nondisciplinary policies to support students taking a break to pursue more intensive treatment. These policies can provide clear treatment recommendations and instructions on what conditions students need to be met in order to return to school, resulting in a higher likelihood of the students enrolling once again. </p>\n\n<h2>Understanding well-being</h2>\n\n<p>Well-being is a word that is top of mind for many higher education leaders, yet colleges and universities do not have a single <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1763369\">definition of what well-being</a> means, though it is often a term schools use to talk about students’ mental health. Well-being <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-for-happiness/201901/what-is-well-being-definition-types-and-well-being-skills\">generally encompasses</a> acknowledging and being comfortable with your feelings, and being equipped to manage stress. </p>\n\n<p>While there is movement toward embedding student mental health and well-being into the very fabric of an institution, many colleges and universities still rely on reaching students in more <a href=\"https://publichealthnotes.com/different-methods-of-health-education/\">traditional ways</a> – through health fairs and information tables in the student center, for example. </p>\n\n<p>While these strategies certainly serve a purpose in helping to raise awareness of mental health resources, when used in isolation, they are unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/collegeaim\">result in actual behavioral change</a> among students.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/611093/black-hispanic-students-greatest-risk-leaving-program.aspx\">Students of color</a>, particularly Black and Latino students, are more likely than white students to temporarily withdraw from college. </p>\n\n<p>One step institutions can take: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1429788\">Hire more faculty, staff and mental health counselors</a> who are people of color and can better connect with minority students through shared lived experiences.  </p>\n\n<h2>Well-being is central to students’ success</h2>\n\n<p>In 2007, an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech University <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/mass-shootings-virginia-tech-april-16-2007-report-review-panel\">shot and killed 32 people</a>, and wounded 17 others, before he died by suicide. </p>\n\n<p>Schools since then have adopted early alert systems – often referred to as <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/health-and-wellness/babson-cares/\">care teams</a> – to help identify students who are struggling, either academically, socially or emotionally. The idea is that schools can intervene and get students connected with campus resources such as academic advisers, student success coaches, accessibility services, financial aid and mental health support. </p>\n\n<p>Ongoing training for faculty, staff and students on how to activate these systems of support and make referrals to a care team is critical to their success. The goal is to cast a wide net so students do not fall through the cracks and go unnoticed when they are not mentally well, which is what happened <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/us/20vtech.html\">with the Virginia Tech shooter</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.masters-in-psychology.net/30-colleges-leading-the-way-in-meditation-for-mental-health/\">Dozens of campuses</a>, including New York University, Indiana State University, the University of North Dakota, The Ohio State University and Harvard University, have also embraced mindfulness practices in recent years, offering breath work and other forms of meditation for their students as free services on campus. </p>\n\n<p>Some campus police departments <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.babson.edu/babson-community-resource-dog/\">have also begun using therapy dogs</a> to help support students’ mental health and bolster community engagement. </p>\n\n<p>Other schools, like <a href=\"https://thestute.com/2025/11/07/library-reduces-hours-and-services-following-university-budget-cuts/\">Stevens Institute of Technology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/09/princeton-news-adpol-princeton-university-library-branches-cuts-hours-amid-budget-cuts\">Princeton University</a>, have stopped keeping labs and libraries open 24/7 as a way to encourage students to take a break and rest – though admittedly most institutions that have made these changes have done so as a result of budget cuts, and less so as a proactive, preventive measure. </p>\n\n<h2>Positioning students for success</h2>\n\n<p>I have long argued that <a href=\"https://www.naspa.org/book/well-being-leadership-in-higher-education-a-guide-for-successful-well-being-programs\">well-being is central to academic, personal and professional success</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In recent years, I have also encouraged schools to position well-being as the key driver to student academic, personal and professional success. </p>\n\n<p>Research has linked students’ well-being to them staying in school, and findings suggest that colleges can develop <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2024.12\">targeted mental health programs to improve retention rates</a>. In other words, focusing on the health and well-being of students may, in fact, lead to better outcomes – emotionally, physically and academically.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267606/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Travia received funding from the American College Health Foundation for serving as lead author and researcher for a series of papers on framing and measuring well-being from 2019-2022. </span></em></p>",

Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation, spoke with Kate Price, <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/kate-price-ph-d\">an associate research scientist at the Wellesley Centers for Women</a> at Wellesley College, where she studies child sexual exploitation and child sex trafficking policy.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is child sex trafficking and how does it differ from other kinds of trafficking?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is a child being traded for sex via force, fraud or coercion. These are children who are under the age of 18. Often what happens, in terms of victim blaming, if a child is, say, 15, 16, 17, there’s this level of blame from perpetrators, the media, relatives, law enforcement, jurors: “She knew what she was doing.” I recently heard this with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T5Hp2WldFk&amp;t=1903s\">the Epstein files back in the news</a>: “He wasn’t into like 8-year-olds. … There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a 5-year-old.” That’s not true. Children cannot make decisions that adults can. Neuroscience shows that <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-7-things-to-know\">children’s brains are not developed</a> until their mid 20s. Children do not have the same decision-making capacity. That very vulnerability is what is preyed upon by perpetrators. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we not use terms like “child prostitution” anymore, and why does language matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the late 1990s and early aughts, at the beginning of <a href=\"https://ovc.ojp.gov/news/archives/announcements/twenty-years-progress-anti-trafficking-movement\">the anti-human trafficking movement</a>, people did use the term child prostitution. In fact, I used it in a white paper that I did, and I’m a survivor. But once we really adopted and embraced the terminology of force, fraud and coercion of human trafficking, that gave us a new frame to think of the power dynamics that are involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. This phrasing captures the true essence of what is happening within child sex trafficking. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a child somehow deciding that they’re going to go out and trade sex for money, heat, food, anything of value. This is a case of perpetrators, whether they are family members or nonfamily traffickers, who are preying on the vulnerability of children who have often been sexually abused prior to their commercial sexual exploitation. This prior abuse adds another layer of vulnerability.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A billboard advertises for help for survivors of sex trafficking.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A billboard in Vadnais Heights, Minn., in 2023 calls for help for survivors of sex trafficking.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/vadnais-heights-minnesota-billboard-advertising-help-for-news-photo/1473556348?adppopup=true\">Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>How do Epstein’s actions fit into the paradigm of trafficking – is he a classic case or an unusual one?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Epstein is not unique. This is absolutely a classic case, for four primary reasons. Child sex trafficking perpetrators are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260515600874\">primarily white men, with wealth and power</a>. Epstein was, granted, among the uber rich and really powerful men. But power is relative to whatever context in which a child is being exploited. The most powerful person in a small town may not be a billionaire like Epstein, but they have disposable income and high socioeconomic status for the area, or they may hold a prominent position in government, church or a civic organization.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein case is also not unique in that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260514555369\">victims are often dehumanized</a>, by perpetrators and in the media. They are blamed, even though they are children who are developmentally incapable of making adult choices. There are <a href=\"https://lamag.com/news/ghislaine-in-chains-what-maxwell-may-know-about-jeffrey-epsteins-john-does/\">transcripts of Maxwell calling the girls “trash</a>.” These are seen as disposable children, not worthy of protections. And they have already been dehumanized within our culture prior to exploitation, whether it be through poverty, lack of educational or employment opportunities, or prior sexual violence. That makes them even more vulnerable to perpetrators such as Epstein and Maxwell, who are looking to prey upon those vulnerabilities. </p>\n\n<p>Third, traffickers often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15248380211025241\">insulate themselves from detection</a> and trafficking charges by having others, such as women or girls, recruiting victims for them, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell.html\">which is exactly what Epstein did</a>. Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/resources/reports/a-six-year-analysis-of-sex-traffickers-of-minors/\">traffickers and buyers often plea down their trafficking charges</a>. That results in low trafficking prosecution rates. They plea down from a charge like trafficking of a minor to assault, so this does not count toward trafficking prosecution rates. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/12/934265386/jeffrey-epsteins-former-prosecutors-used-poor-judgment-in-deal-doj-says\">Epstein did exactly this in 2008</a> when he accepted prosecutor Alex Acosta’s nonprosecution agreement to plead guilty to two lesser Florida state-level prostitution charges rather than facing the multiple federal child sex trafficking charges for which Epstein was being investigated. This ability to use their wealth and power hides the truth of what is happening.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What systems allow sex trafficking to happen, and how can we change those systems?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement often looks the other way. In the Epstein case, one of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/us/epstein-women-lawsuit-fbi\">victims had reached out to the FBI</a> decades ago and nothing happened. It’s really been the persistence of the survivors, saying people really need to look at this. </p>\n\n<p>Child sex trafficking is not a political issue. It’s one of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/magazine/the-conservative-crusade-thats-about-so-much-more-than-epstein.html\">the few bipartisan issues in our country</a> that is so culturally divided. Yet Americans need to acknowledge that perpetrators comes from all political affiliations, they come from all races, socioeconomic status. As a culture, we really need to not blame victims and survivors. These are children who are being manipulated and violated. So recognizing the truth of power differences between perpetrators and victims is something that we as a culture very much need to do. By supporting victims, we can use our power – as relatives, jurors, constituents, elected officials – to hold traffickers and buyers to account. Victim-blaming creates a diversion that cements perpetrators’ ability to exploit and abuse children without fear of detection.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a red blazer points to a poster showing a man hugging a woman.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announces charges against Ghislaine Maxwell on July 2, 2020, for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/JeffreyEpsteinAssociate/063a1414200045c2a02aae49a6a28d13/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/John Minchillo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In terms of legislation, most states in the country still retain the right to <a href=\"https://humantraffickingsearch.org/resource/safe-harbor-does-your-state-arrest-minors-for-prostitution/\">criminalize sexually exploited minors</a>, either through arrests or prosecution. These are laws that all states have considered since 2007, when New York was the first state to <a href=\"https://ww2.nycourts.gov/sites/default/files/document/files/2018-07/MULLEN%20_HUMAN%20TRAFFICKING_1_d_0.pdf\">introduce a Safe Harbor law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Massachusetts, where I live, law enforcement retains the right to <a href=\"https://reportcards.sharedhope.org/year2025/massachussetts/\">arrest or prosecute a minor for prostitution</a>. That often doesn’t happen. But the reason law enforcement says <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15564886.2022.2153956\">it needs to have these laws</a> is because it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253353/\">encourages children to get services</a>. It’s a leverage point. </p>\n\n<p>But oftentimes children do not trust law enforcement. And often for good reason. <a href=\"https://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/26/46\">Some law enforcement are perpretrators</a>. Other times, law enforcement tells sex-trafficked minors, “We’re doing this for your protection, we’re going to lock you up.” Both instances are deeply traumatizing and lead to mistrust of the police. That being said, so many extraordinary law enforcement agents are committed to supporting child sex trafficking victims and holding perpetrators to account. </p>\n\n<p>Much of this retraumatization happens because local and state governments do not have the money for social services, trauma-informed, child sex trafficking-specific services, and housing opportunities for children to be able to heal. What we have is a robust criminal legal system. So, until we have a robust system that can support children who have been trafficked, sex trafficking is going to continue, in my experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any last thoughts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need to acknowledge low prosecution rates of child sexual abuse cases, that 14% of all reported – just reported – <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/images/pdf/2022-williams-block-pcsa-white-paper.pdf\">child sexual abuse perpetrators are convicted</a> or plead guilty. Similarly, in terms of adult rape charges, <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Archived-Projects/sexual-violence-case-attrition\">1% of cases end in a conviction</a> or guilty plea. So much of this lack of perpetrator accountability comes through this employment of plea deals and dehumanizing and retraumatizing victims during legal proceedings. </p>\n\n<p>So we need to acknowledge when our criminal-legal system is not doing justice to victims whatsoever, and they’re allowing perpetrators to walk free. In the Epstein case, we’re focused on a few people, while hundreds of perpetrators continue to walk free. By employing these tactics, predators will continue to use the societal silence and misperceptions to their advantage. If it takes a village to raise a child, it also takes a village to sexually exploit a child.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270127/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kate Price does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Hundreds of thousands more were imprisoned, sent to labor camps or subjected to political persecution. To these figures, we must add the roughly half a million people who <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9788479190811/memoria-historica-Guerra-civil-espa%C3%B1ola-8479190817/plp\">fled or were forced into exile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Among the multitudes of Francoism’s victims were women and children who endured psychological and physical abuse in prisons, orphanages and asylums. Yet for decades their experiences have remained marginal in the public narrative – highlighting the uneven acknowledgment of different groups of victims amid Spain’s broader struggle to confront its past.</p>\n\n<p>Still, their stories remain alive in the testimonies of the women who were imprisoned by the regime. In the summer of 2024, I conducted research at <a href=\"https://politicasdelamemoria.org/en/2011/01/documentation-center-of-historical-memory-5/\">the Documentation Center of Historical Memory in Salamanca</a>, collecting documented written accounts of traumatic experiences suffered by Spain’s female population under Franco. They reveal the extent to which Francoist repression was structured through gender, framing women as inherently subordinate and subjecting those who resisted the regime’s patriarchal order to especially severe punishment.</p>\n\n<h2>Franco’s gendered violence</h2>\n\n<p>My study explores the testimonies of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2020.1740775\">women imprisoned during the civil war or subsequent decades</a>, all of whom endured suffering related to their motherhood. While some were detained for their ideological allegiance to the republic that preceded Franco’s ascent, others had no formal partisan affiliations or were merely related to men who did.  </p>\n\n<p>These women suffered what many survivors and historians <a href=\"https://buscador.womenslegacyproject.eu/catalog/40892011_en?locale=en\">have described as a “double punishment</a>” – targeted not only for their beliefs or associations but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc1TpHOEiEg\">just for being women and mothers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest testimony I came across was from a woman detained in 1939, just three years after Franco, a military general, <a href=\"https://tienda.elviejotopo.com/fascismo/1113-el-silencio-roto-mujeres-contra-el-franquismo-9788495776402.html\">led an uprising</a> against the democratically elected government of the Second Republic that precipitated the civil war and his subsequent reign.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A military men salutes toward a crowd.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Franco gives a fascist salute as he and his Nationalist forces enter Barcelona in March 1939.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GENFRANCO/c4d09cf1dde6da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Under Franco’s dictatorial regime, women’s roles were rigidly controlled by the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constructing_Spanish_Womanhood/lX3mYCs6qq8C?hl=en\">ideology of National Catholicism</a>, which linked femininity, motherhood and loyalty to the state. The church reinforced this vision, “dictating that women served the fatherland through self-sacrifice and dedication to the common good.”</p>\n\n<p>Those who defied the patriarchy were criminalized and subjected to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02656914231214932\">re-education</a>” focused on religious values. </p>\n\n<p>Women’s so-called “redemption” under this reeducation was <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9788484602309/Irredentas-Spanish-Edition-Vinyes-Ricard-8484602303/plp\">no less violent than their confinement</a>. As one witness described, in May of 1939 the auditorium of Las Ventas prison was prepared to celebrate “two girls and a boy (… recently) born in prison.” During the ceremony, a choir “composed of forty inmates, including opera singers, music teachers, violinists, and amateurs,” had to perform the national anthems with the fascist arm-raised salute. </p>\n\n<p>Yet confinement itself was particularly brutal.</p>\n\n<p>According to Josefina García, a woman imprisoned during the 1940s, guards regularly insulted and beat inmates. “If you were at home behaving like decent women, you wouldn’t be here,” she recalled one saying. García continued: “Of course, they used a crude, sexist language. The police ‘used words’ in a way that sometimes leave a mark deeper than a bruise.” </p>\n\n<p>Gender also played a role in the type of punishment prisoners received. Following their arrest, women were subjected to <a href=\"https://www.vscw.ca/en/node/41\">head shaving, forced ingestion of castor oil</a> and the subsequent public humiliation of being made to walk in circles while defecating. In addition, they were often subjected to sexual violence by prison guards or interrogating officers.</p>\n\n<p>Recounting her experience, another witness reported the case of an 18-year-old sister of a guerrilla fighter in Valencia who “was subjected to terrible torture, stripped naked in a room with several Civil Guards who pricked her breasts, genitals, and stomach with … needles.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Someone holds a sign for a missing person at a protest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A protester holds a banner with an image of an unknown woman – a victim of the Franco regime.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=franco%20victims%20spain&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Paul White</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Motherhood as battleground</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most painful aspects of Franco’s repression was the forced separation of mothers and their children. </p>\n\n<p>Upon incarceration, women frequently lost custody of their sons and daughters, who were placed in orphanages or adopted by families loyal to Franco and his regime. Such violent ruptures of the maternal bond were more than an act of personal cruelty – they were a calculated political strategy rooted in the broader Francoist ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Since Francoism promoted an <a href=\"https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/1805d771-b951-4a0e-9b03-39c4622edbe4/content\">image of women as obedient wives and self-sacrificing mothers</a> devoted to the Catholic family model, Republican women were demonized as immoral, dangerous and unworthy of motherhood.</p>\n\n<p>By stripping women of their children, the regime both punished them and reinforced its narrative that only “loyal” women could be true mothers.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, child-rearing or birth during incarceration was marked by fear and uncertainty. In certain cases, newborns were allowed to stay with their mothers for a short time. However, a lack of proper nourishment and mental exhaustion made breastfeeding an impossible task. </p>\n\n<p>At times, women who began to lactate were denied the possibility of nursing their infants, leading to physical pain and emotional torment.</p>\n\n<p>More often, babies were permanently taken away altogether, deemed at risk of being “contaminated” by their mothers’ ideological values. </p>\n\n<p>“When I was arrested, my son was five days old,” one victim, Carmen Caamaño, reported. “About a year later, they said I no longer needed to breastfeed him and took the child out of the prison. Some friends had to take him in because I had no family there.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Women present flowers at a memorial.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Women pay tribute to victims of the Franco regime in front of a flag of the Spanish Republic.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=women%20franco%20spain&amp;mediaType=photo\">P Photo/Alvaro Barrientos</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There were also countless cases in which children were imprisoned alongside their mothers. With no other relatives to care for them, these children suffered from hunger, disease and a lack of basic hygiene in their overcrowded cells. For mothers, the psychological burden was immense as they were forced to watch their children suffer, yet they had no power to protect them. </p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 1941, about six or seven children died daily in these prisons from starvation and diseases, according to accounts of survivors.</p>\n\n<h2>Trauma and resistance</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside trauma, there were also moments of resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Mothers in prison looked for ways to nurture their children despite scarcity and fear. Testimonies I reviewed relate cases of inmates sharing food, telling stories and protecting children as best they could. These small acts of care were a quiet but powerful form of defiance.</p>\n\n<p>Yet for many women, the trauma of these losses never healed. Survivors often speak of the pain of separation as an open wound that lasted a lifetime. Children raised in prisons or separated from their families carried the scars into adulthood. </p>\n\n<p>Even decades after the regime ended, many descendants still struggle with the weight of this silenced past. Yet because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/opinion/spain-sanchez-amnesty-law.html\">Spain’s Amnesty Act of 1977</a>, which was granted for past political crimes, those responsible for atrocities committed under Franco have seldom been held accountable. </p>\n\n<p>Histories of the Franco years often leave the grief of the intergenerational trauma in the shadows. And for the victims themselves, the traumatic motherhood experiences under his dictatorship reveal more than just personal suffering – they expose how authoritarian power can reach into the most intimate parts of life.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249931/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Zaya Rustamova received funding to conduct this study from Radow J.

Whether they <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html\">hit that target in 2022</a>, as claimed, is up for debate.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have found many cases where the reported numbers were inflated, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/has-100-billion-climate-goal-been-reached\">largely due to relabeling of general aid</a> that was already being provided and calling it “climate aid.”</p>\n\n<p>The United Kingdom, for example, claims it is on track to meet its £11.6 billion (about $15.2 billion) pledge, but it is doing so in part by <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-climate-aid-to-hit-11-6bn-goal-but-only-due-to-accounting-rule-change/\">reclassifying existing humanitarian and development aid</a> as “climate finance.”</p>\n\n<p>This practice undermines the <a href=\"https://careclimatechange.org/seeing-double-decoding-the-additionality-of-climate-finance/\">principle of additionality</a> – the idea that climate finance should represent “new and additional” resources beyond traditional aid, and not simply be a new label on funds already planned for other purposes.</p>\n\n<p>An analysis by the climate news site Carbon Brief suggests that to truly meet its target, the U.K. would need to provide <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-climate-aid-to-hit-11-6bn-goal-but-only-due-to-accounting-rule-change/\">78% more than it currently does</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.K.’s “creative accounting” is not a one-off.</p>\n\n<p>The Center for Global Development estimates that <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/100-billion-climate-finance-provided-fact-or-fiction\">at least one-third</a> of the new public climate funds in 2022 actually came from existing aid budgets. In some cases, the money had been shifted to climate adaptation projects, but often development projects were relabeled as “climate finance.” </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"zDnr7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zDnr7/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>What’s counted as climate finance comes from a mix of sources and is predominantly provided through loans and grants. Some funding is bilateral, flowing directly from one country to another. Some is multilateral and distributed through organizations such as the World Bank or the <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/about\">Green Climate Fund</a> that are funded by the world’s governments. Money from private investors and corporations can also count in this growing but fragmented system.</p>\n\n<p>Countries providing the assistance have been able to stretch the definition of climate finance so they can count almost any project, including some that have little to do with reducing emissions or helping communities adapt. </p>\n\n<h2>Fossil fuels, hotels and ice cream stores</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to climate finance, the devil is in the project details.</p>\n\n<p>Take Japan, for example. In 2020, its state-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation used an environmental fund to finance a 1,200-megawatt coal plant in central Vietnam. That power plant <a href=\"https://www.marketforces.org.au/research/vietnam/vung-ang-2/\">will emit far more air pollution</a> than <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/comparison-of-coal-power-plant-emissions-standards/\">Japan would allow</a> for a power plant within its own borders.</p>\n\n<p>The same bank <a href=\"https://www.jica.go.jp/Resource/egypt/english/office/others/c8h0vm0000b394wa-att/publication_15.pdf\">labeled an airport expansion in Egypt</a> as “eco-friendly” because it included solar panels and LED lights. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An external view of a new concourse\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Japan counted funding for Egypt’s Alexandria International Airport, formerly Borg El Arab International Airport, as climate finance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexandria_International_Airport_%28Egypt%29_Terminal_2.jpg\">Abdelrhman 1990</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In some cases, these projects increase greenhouse gas emissions, rather than lowering them. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, Japan funded an <a href=\"https://www.jica.go.jp/english/overseas/png/activities/activity20.html\">airport expansion in Papua New Guinea</a> that it labeled as climate finance because it was expected to reduce fuel use. However, an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, used in Reuters’ analysis, found that if the airport meets passenger targets in its first three years, emissions from outbound flights will rise by an <a href=\"https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/\">estimated 90% over 2013 levels</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Italy claimed $4.7 million as climate finance for <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/un-climate-finance-1.6861666\">helping a chocolate and ice cream company expand into Asia</a> by saying that the project had a “climate component.” And the U.S. counted a $19.5 million <a href=\"https://www.actionaidusa.org/climate-finance-quantity-matters-but-so-does-quality/\">Marriott Hotel development in Haiti</a> as “climate finance” because the hotel project included stormwater control and hurricane protection measures.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Xql1P\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xql1P/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These are not isolated examples. Reuters reviewed climate finance documents it received from 27 countries and found that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/special-report-nations-who-pledged-to-fight-climate-change-are-sending-money-to-idUSL6N37N076/\">at least $3 billion labeled as climate finance</a> went to projects that had little or nothing to do with fighting or recovering from climate change. That included <a href=\"https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/\">movie financing, coal plant construction and crime prevention programs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For many of these projects, the money comes in the form of loans, which means the developed country that provided the loan will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/\">make money off the interest</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why fixing climate finance matters</h2>\n\n<p>A central test for the success of international climate talks will be whether governments can finally agree on a shared definition of “climate finance,” one that protects the interests of vulnerable countries and avoids creating long-term debt.</p>\n\n<p>Without that clear definition, donor countries can continue to count marginal or loosely related investments as climate finance.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s43093-025-00596-6\">plenty of examples</a> that show how targeted climate finance can help vulnerable countries cut emissions, adapt to rising risks and recover from climate-driven disasters. It has helped saved lives in Bangladesh with <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/06/29/climate-finance-protects-the-vulnerable\">early warning systems and storm shelters</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2023.100495\">improved crop resistance to worsening drought</a> in Kenya, among other projects.</p>\n\n<p>But when governments and banks count existing development projects and fossil fuel upgrades as “climate investments,” the result is an illusion of progress while developing countries face worsening climate risks. At the same time, wealthy countries are still spending <a href=\"https://data.one.org/analysis/climate-finance-hypocrisy\">hundreds of billions of dollars on fossil fuel subsidies</a>, which further drive climate change.</p>\n\n<p>For countries from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/g-s1-95941/haiti-jamaica-cuba-hurricane-melissa-recovery\">Jamaica</a> to <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/bangladesh/blog/vulnerability-action-why-bangladeshs-climate-vulnerability-index-cvi-game-changer\">Bangladesh</a> to <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp007\">the Maldives</a>, the threats from climate change are existential. Every misreported or “creatively counted” climate finance dollar means slower recovery, lost livelihoods and longer waits for clean water and electricity after the next storm.</p>\n\n<p><em>University of Southern California environmental science students Nickole Aguilar Cortes and Brandon Kim contributed to this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268764/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Gibson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Water is a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/eight-ingredients-life-in-space.html\">key ingredient for life</a>, and on a planet too close to its star, water on its surface may “boil”; too far, and it could freeze. This zone marks the region in between. </p>\n\n<p>But being in this <a href=\"https://www.space.com/goldilocks-zone-habitable-area-life\">sweet spot</a> doesn’t automatically mean a planet is hospitable to life. Other factors, like whether a planet is geologically active or has processes that regulate gases in its atmosphere, play a role. </p>\n\n<p>The habitable zone provides a useful guide to search for signs of life on exoplanets – planets outside our solar system orbiting other stars. But what’s in these planets’ atmospheres holds the next clue about whether liquid water — and possibly life — exists beyond Earth.  </p>\n\n<p>On Earth, the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/\">greenhouse effect</a>, caused by gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor, keeps the planet warm enough for liquid water and life as we know it. Without an atmosphere, Earth’s surface temperature would <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/\">average around zero degrees Fahrenheit</a> (minus 18 degrees Celsius), far below the freezing point of water. </p>\n\n<p>The boundaries of the habitable zone are defined by how much of a “greenhouse effect” is necessary to maintain the surface temperatures that allow for liquid water to persist. It’s a balance between sunlight and atmospheric warming.</p>\n\n<p>Many planetary scientists, <a href=\"https://profiles.rice.edu/student/morgan-underwood\">including me</a>, are seeking to understand if the processes responsible for regulating Earth’s climate are operating on other habitable zone worlds. We use what we know about Earth’s geology and climate to predict how these processes might appear elsewhere, which is where my geoscience expertise comes in. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A diagram showing three planets orbiting a star: The one closes to the star is labeled 'too hot,' the next is labeled 'just right,' and the farthest is labeled 'too cold.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698465/original/file-20251024-56-wbepse.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Picturing the habitable zone of a solar system analog, with Venus- and Mars-like planets outside of the ‘just right’ temperature zone.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/habitable-zone/\">NASA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why the habitable zone?</h2>\n\n<p>The habitable zone is a simple and powerful idea, and for good reason. It provides a starting point, directing astronomers to where they might expect to find planets with liquid water, without needing to know every detail about the planet’s atmosphere or history. </p>\n\n<p>Its definition is partially informed by what scientists know about Earth’s rocky neighbors. Mars, which lies just outside the outer edge of the habitable zone, shows <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/nasa-rover-finds-fresh-evidence-warm-wet-past-mars-2025-04-17/\">clear evidence of ancient rivers and lakes</a> where liquid water once flowed. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Venus is currently too close to the Sun to be within the habitable zone. Yet, some <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/science/what-happened-to-all-the-water-on-venus/\">geochemical evidence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/giss/nasa-climate-modeling-suggests-venus-may-have-been-habitable/\">modeling studies</a> suggest Venus may have had water in its past, though how much and for how long remains uncertain. </p>\n\n<p>These examples show that while the habitable zone is not a perfect predictor of habitability, it provides a useful starting point. </p>\n\n<h2>Planetary processes can inform habitability</h2>\n\n<p>What the habitable zone doesn’t do is determine whether a planet can sustain habitable conditions over long periods of time. On Earth, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2006.1895\">stable climate allowed life to emerge and persist</a>. Liquid water could remain on the surface, <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/origin-life-earth-explained\">giving slow chemical reactions enough time</a> to build the molecules of life and <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/early-life-had-evolutionary-power-to-survive-radical-changes-in-environment/\">let early ecosystems develop resilience</a> to change, which reinforced habitability. </p>\n\n<p>Life emerged on Earth, but <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/astrobiology/an-ancient-partnership-co-evolution-of-earth-environments-and-microbial-lifean-ancient-partnership/\">continued to reshape the environments it evolved in</a>, making them more conducive to life. </p>\n\n<p>This stability likely unfolded over hundreds of millions of years, as the planet’s surface, oceans and atmosphere worked together as part of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/biosphere-2s-latest-mission-learning-how-life-first-emerged-on-earth-and-how-to-make-barren-worlds-habitable-262293\">a slow but powerful system</a> to regulate Earth’s temperature. </p>\n\n<p>A key part of this system is how <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle\">Earth recycles inorganic carbon</a> between the atmosphere, surface and oceans over the course of millions of years. Inorganic carbon refers to carbon bound in atmospheric gases, dissolved in seawater or locked in minerals, rather than biological material. This part of the carbon cycle <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2022/earth-stabilizing-temperature-1116\">acts like a natural thermostat</a>. When volcanoes release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide molecules trap heat and warm the planet. As temperatures rise, rain and weathering draw carbon out of the air and store it in rocks and oceans. </p>\n\n<p>If the planet cools, this process slows down, allowing carbon dioxide, a warming <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas\">greenhouse gas</a>, to build up in the atmosphere again. This part of the carbon cycle has helped Earth recover from past ice ages and avoid runaway warming. </p>\n\n<p>Even as the Sun has gradually brightened, this cycle has contributed to keeping temperatures on Earth within a range where liquid water and life can persist for long spans of time. </p>\n\n<p>Now, scientists are asking whether similar geological processes might operate on other planets, and if so, how they might detect them. For example, if researchers could observe enough rocky planets in their stars’ habitable zones, they could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19896-2\">look for a pattern</a> connecting the amount of sunlight a planet receives and how much carbon dioxide is in its atmosphere. Finding such a pattern may hint that the same kind of carbon-cycling process could be operating elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>The mix of gases in a planet’s atmosphere is shaped by what’s happening on or below its surface. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ada384\">One study</a> shows that measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide in a number of rocky planets could reveal whether their surfaces are broken into a number of moving plates, like Earth’s, or if their crusts are more rigid. On Earth, these <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tectonics.html\">shifting plates</a> drive volcanism and rock weathering, which are key to carbon cycling.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A diagram showing a few small planets orbiting a star.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Simulation of what space telescopes, like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will capture when looking at distant solar systems.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/\">STScI, NASA GSFC</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Keeping an eye on distant atmospheres</h2>\n\n<p>The next step will be <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aa738a\">toward gaining a population-level perspective</a> of planets in their stars’ habitable zones.

Three weeks later, the <a href=\"https://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/\">General Framework Agreement</a>, known as the Dayton Peace Accords, was signed.</p>\n\n<p>The war over Bosnia was the most brutal and devastating of the wars spawned by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Yugoslavia\">dissolution of Yugoslavia</a>. Attacked from the moment it moved toward independence in early 1992 by militias supported by the neighboring nations of Croatia and Serbia, Bosnia was born under fire and nearly perished. Half of its population of 4.4 million were forcefully displaced, and over <a href=\"https://everycasualty.org/conflict/bosnia-herzegovina/\">100,000 people died</a> during the conflict. </p>\n\n<p>Ethnic cleansing and war crimes marked the war, including <a href=\"https://www.icty.org/en/outreach/documentaries/srebrenica-genocide-no-room-for-denial\">the Srebrenica genocide</a> of July 1995, in which <a href=\"https://srebrenicamemorial.org/en\">more than 8,000 Bosniak victims</a> were murdered by the army of Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/getting-to-dayton/\">The peace agreed to at Dayton</a> left Bosnia, or Bosnia and Herzegovina as it is known in full, intact as a country but divided into two entities, Republika Srpska – a secessionist entity proclaimed by ethnonationalist Serbs in January 1992 – and the Bosnian Federation. Meanwhile, an international military force was deployed to secure the peace.</p>\n\n<p>But it was an ugly peace: The patient was saved, but left deformed and weak. As scholars who have written extensively about <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1007/978-3-319-48293-4\">the Bosnian war</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bosnia-Remade-Ethnic-Cleansing-Reversal/dp/0199730369\">its aftermath</a>, we believe the legacy of the Dayton Peace Accords, 30 years on, is decidedly mixed.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"2VPJs\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2VPJs/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The sorting of ethno-territories</h2>\n\n<p>Bosnia’s life after Dayton can be divided into three roughly decade-long eras: reconstruction, stalemate and permanent crisis. </p>\n\n<p>The first decade was the toughest but most hopeful. With peace enforced by an international force including U.S. and Russian troops, Bosnians returned to their war-shattered country.</p>\n\n<p>But restoring the country’s social fabric proved hard. While the international community aspired to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Cleansing-through-Minority-Returns/dp/0198941358\">reverse ethnic cleansing</a>, the obstacles were immense.</p>\n\n<p>A once <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bosnia-Hercegovina-Tradition-Robert-Donia/dp/0231101619\">proudly multicultural country</a> was left divided into separate ethno-territories.</p>\n\n<p>Under <a href=\"https://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/annex-7-2/\">the Dayton Accords</a>, Bosnians were promised the right to return home.

What became evident, however, is that “minority returns” – that is, people returning to places where they would be a minority community – were limited. Many returnees reacquired their old property after a struggle but promptly sold it to build a life elsewhere among people who were the same ethnicity as them. </p>\n\n<p>Cross-ethnic trust was largely <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/books/srebrenica-in-the-aftermath-of-genocide/9D3BD3456AB6963AA1D5F2C888AB0865\">shattered by wartime experiences</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Incompatible horizons</h2>\n\n<p>The first decade was peak <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/swordsploughshar0000ashd\">liberal international statebuilding</a>. An international high representative charged with “civilian implementation” of the Dayton Accords centralized control over military and intelligence functions at the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230501379\">state level</a>. A central state border service and investigations agency was created. So also was a central state court, state-level criminal codes and an indirect taxation authority to unify indirect tax collection and finance <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Improvised-State-Sovereignty-Performance-Agency/dp/1444337009/\">state institutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bosnia’s trajectory, though, stalled in 2006 when the high representative <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intervention-Work-Norton-Global-Ethics/dp/0393081206/\">stepped back from state building</a>. In April 2006, a package of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2747/1538-7216.47.1.61\">constitutional amendments</a> designed to streamline Dayton by strengthening central state institutions fell two votes short in the state Parliament. </p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, the package was not blocked by parties from Republika Srpska, traditional obstructionists, but by former Prime Minister <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Silajd%C5%BEi%C4%87\">Haris Silajdžić’s</a> Bosniak-dominated party. This failure set the stage for a decade of polarization and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13537110903372367\">stalemate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Silajdžić campaigned for abolition of the entities – Republika Srpska and the Bosnian Federation – and the creation of a single united Bosnia. Republika Srpska’s leading politician, Milorad Dodik, answered by floating the prohibited <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/abs/republika-srpska-will-have-a-referendum-the-rhetorical-politics-of-milorad-dodik/E8C4E2E90DF78AEC110E754D8F83A015\">idea of an entity independence referendum</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the high representative <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/diplomatic-counterinsurgency/03903B777718EC4D869F44CEC119DC2D\">largely passive</a>, Bosnia was stalemated between incompatible horizons, each side strong enough to block but too weak to prevail. </p>\n\n<p>Dodik turned <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/abs/comments-on-gerard-toals-republika-srpska-will-have-a-referendum-the-rhetorical-politics-of-milorad-dodik/DB4F6737DE906348BDA1B40098F9EC98\">referendum talk</a> in Republika Srpska into a steady repertoire of threat, while casting central state institutions in Sarajevo as rotten, artificial and destined to fail. In the process, Dodik and his family got rich, creating a classic <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2793\">patronal power network</a> across Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p>With the media thoroughly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315594477\">divided by wartime allegiances</a>, the public sphere was filled with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17449057.2022.2072560\">incendiary rhetoric</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The word “inat” is a shared idiom across Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. It is stubborn uprightness, a combination of narcissism and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-trumps-foreign-policy-might-be-driven-by-simple-spite-heres-what-to-do-about-it-252099\">spite</a>. Politics increasingly rewarded those who could perform “inat” more vividly than their rivals.</p>\n\n<p>Central state institutions in Bosnia did not collapse <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/building-democracy-in-the-yugoslav-successor-states/durable-oligarchy-bosnia-and-herzegovinas-false-postwar-democratic-transition/7C7F0982734391DB0D6BD86B5AFF771C\">but became sclerotic</a>. Procedures multiplied, confidence thinned and decision-making settled into a theater of anticipatory vetoes where the point was less to implement a program than to keep imagined endpoints – the creation of a unified nation on one side; an independent Republika Srpska on the other – alive and to make the other side feel the pain of their impossibility.</p>\n\n<h2>A country on the brink</h2>\n\n<p>A decade of stalemate slowly evolved into a condition of permanent crisis. </p>\n\n<p>In November 2015, Bosnia’s Constitutional Court ruled that the marking of Jan. 9 as “Republika Srpska Day” – a celebration of virtual independence – was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/9/why-is-republika-srpska-day-controversial-in-bosnia\">discriminatory and illegal</a> under human rights law.</p>\n\n<p>Dodik, the Republika Srpska’s de facto leader, responded by organizing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37465653\">an extralegal referendum</a> whose result asserted that the Republika Srpska population wanted the date retained. </p>\n\n<p>Defiance evolved into active subversion of the constitutional order and provisions of Dayton. The Republika Srpska parliament passed laws that directly challenged central state institutions built in the first postwar decade. With weak enforcement capacity, the Bosnian state was unable to command compliance. </p>\n\n<p>When in 2021 a new high representative was appointed over Russian objections, Dodik rejected his authority outright.

But “rabbi” means much more than that. For example, a rabbi could be a teacher, a nonprofit executive for a Jewish organization or a scholar of Jewish law – and, increasingly, some of those roles are held by Orthodox women.  </p>\n\n<p>For decades, liberal denominations have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-ordination-of-the-first-female-rabbi-50-years-ago-has-brought-many-changes-and-some-challenges-181391\">permitted women to be ordained</a>. Orthodox Judaism, however, has largely prohibited it. Yet attitudes toward women’s study of rabbinic texts is changing, leading some Orthodox leaders to conclude that women are <a href=\"https://www.associationforjewishstudies.org/publications-research/ajs-perspectives/the-body-issue/orthodox-female-clergy-embodying-religious-authority\">qualified for rabbinic jobs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel’s chief rabbis – known as the Rabbinate, and historically seen as the top authority for the country’s Orthodox institutions – do not recognize women as rabbis or permit their ordination. But a significant change came in July 2025, when Israel’s High Court of Justice determined that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-861147#google_vignette\">women must be allowed to take the Rabbinate’s exams</a> about Jewish law. The chief rabbis appealed the decision, but the court <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-873527\">rejected their request for a retrial</a> in November.</p>\n\n<p>These tests are required to apply for public sector jobs as any kind of Jewish religious authority in Israel: ensuring that restaurants adhere to Jewish dietary laws, for example. Passing does not make someone an ordained rabbi; ordination is conferred through private rabbis and schools, and most Orthodox communities do not recognize female rabbis. But it does allow women to apply for jobs previously available only to men and receive higher salaries for the educational jobs they have already. Most importantly, the High Court’s decision recognizes that women have achieved high levels of education in rabbinic law.</p>\n\n<p>I am <a href=\"https://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/people/core-faculty/michal-raucher\">a scholar of Jewish women and gender</a> who researches religious authority among Orthodox women. While there have always been highly educated women, the court’s ruling reflects a growing trend among Orthodox women, while also opening up professional opportunities. </p>\n\n<h2>From Torah to Talmud</h2>\n\n<p>Formed in the 19th century, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/jewish-denominations-a-brief-guide-for-the-perplexed-207297\">Orthodox Judaism</a> is oriented around a strict observance of Jewish law and commitment to traditional gender roles. The denomination contains many divisions, each one adjusting their observance of Jewish law differently in response to modernity. While boys and men have been traditionally educated in Torah and rabbinic texts, historically girls and women did not have access to any formal Jewish education. </p>\n\n<p>In the early 20th century, Jewish Polish teacher Sarah Schenirer <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sarah-schenirer-and-the-bais-yaakov-movement/6305A7D1D56973D1B48B99EB601A4A97\">revolutionized Orthodox girls’ education</a> by founding the Bais Yaakov school system, now found in many countries. The <a href=\"https://thebaisyaakovproject.religion.utoronto.ca/timeline-sarah-schenirer-and-interwar-bais-yaakov/\">Bais Yaakov education</a> focused on teaching women Torah, while maintaining women’s place within the Jewish home.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo shows several rows of girls formally posed for a large class picture outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Bais Yaakov Orthodox school for girls in what is now Bielsko-Biala, Poland, around 1938.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beth_Jaakow_Bielsko_Biala_01.jpg\">Collection of the Archive of the Jewish Community in Bielsko-Biala, Poland/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But soon another debate arose: whether women could study Talmud. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Talmud\">This text</a>, composed between the second and seventh centuries C.E., contains the building blocks of rabbinic law. Studying the Talmud means learning the language, references and argument style of the Jewish legal system, called “halakha.”</p>\n\n<p>Supporters and opponents of Talmud study for women both argued that <a href=\"https://wsupress.wayne.edu/9780814344804/\">it would forever alter orthodoxy</a>. Opponents feared that if women understood Talmudic discussions, they would be interested in participating more in public religious life, upsetting the gender norms at the heart of orthodoxy. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, in the 1970s, some well-known rabbis in Israel and America <a href=\"https://thelehrhaus.com/commentary/nafshah-hashkah-ba-torah-a-response-to-rabbi-saul-berman/?rq=talmud\">invited women into Talmud study</a>. Since then, the number of Orthodox institutions that offer advanced Talmud study for women has grown significantly. Fifty years ago, there were only two options: <a href=\"https://www.yu.edu/stern\">Stern College of Yeshiva University</a> in New York, or Michlelet Bruriah in Israel, now called <a href=\"https://www.midreshet-lindenbaum.org.il/\">Midreshet Lindenbaum</a>. Today, dozens of institutions offer programs for Orthodox women who want to study rabbinic law. </p>\n\n<p>The institutions where women can learn Talmud and rabbinic law span the Orthodox landscape. Many are affiliated with open or modern orthodoxy, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/jewish-denominations-a-brief-guide-for-the-perplexed-207297\">have embraced changes</a> related to gender roles. Some cater to the <a href=\"https://www.harediresearchgroup.org/report/\">Haredi or “ultra-Orthodox” population</a>, and others to communities in between.</p>\n\n<p>Most students who complete these programs are not seeking traditional ordination as rabbis. But the women graduate prepared for several other types of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/orthodox-jewish-womens-leadership-is-growing-and-its-not-all-about-rabbis-169498\">religious leadership</a>, such as Jewish education, or as halakha guides for other women. Some programs prepare students to answer Jewish legal questions in particular areas, such as practices during menstruation or childbirth.</p>\n\n<h2>Feminist network</h2>\n\n<p>This growth in opportunities for Orthodox women is the result of a network of Orthodox feminists working across borders since the 1970s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a purple dress and headwrap gestures as she speaks on stage, facing a large, darkened auditorium full of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Orthodox women attend an event to celebrate the completion of a 7½-year cycle of daily Talmud study in Jerusalem on Jan. 5, 2020.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IsraelOrthodoxWomen/762c2c58a17542098ff36f0335ae0d29/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Michlelet Bruriah, for example, was founded by two American Jews who immigrated to Israel in the 1960s. Several other educational institutions developed through this network – including <a href=\"https://www.matan.org.il/en/\">Matan</a>, <a href=\"https://nishmat.net/\">Nishmat</a> <a href=\"https://yeshivat.drisha.org/\">and Drisha</a>, which are currently located in Israel. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/\">Yeshivat Maharat</a>, the first Orthodox seminary to ordain women as rabbis, is in New York. Several of its teachers and students came from these Israeli institutions, and some of their donors have also supported the schools in Israel. </p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit challenging the Israeli chief rabbis’ restriction on women taking the Jewish law exam <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/chief-rabbinate-must-open-rabbinical-tests-to-women-high-court-rules/\">was filed</a> by several people involved in this network. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Seth Farber, for example, is an American immigrant to Israel and <a href=\"https://www.itim.org.il/en/\">the founder of ITIM</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for Jewish religious pluralism within Israeli society. He filed the lawsuit along with his wife, Michelle Cohen Farber, another American immigrant to Israel. She uses the title “rabbanit,” which traditionally refers to someone married to a rabbi. In her case, it also refers to her own expertise in Jewish legal texts: She <a href=\"https://hadran.org.il/\">co-founded Hadran</a>, an organization that promotes Talmud study among women. </p>\n\n<p>Other petitioners include Rabbanit Avital Engelberg, an Israeli-born graduate of <a href=\"https://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/\">Yeshivat Maharat</a> who directs the seminary’s Israeli branch.</p>\n\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n\n<p>Women’s training allows them to enter a variety of fields. Opportunities for Orthodox women’s religious leadership is growing, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/orthodox-jewish-womens-leadership-is-growing-and-its-not-all-about-rabbis-169498\">and it’s not all about ordination</a>. “Yoatzot halacha,” for example, counsel other women about issues related to marriage, sex and reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, these programs – and the Israeli court’s decision – validate women’s religious leadership. For decades, many Orthodox Jews have looked to Israel’s Orthodox rabbinate as the arbiter of religious authenticity. The ruling forces Orthodox Judaism worldwide to recognize that women can achieve high levels of Talmudic education. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the proliferation of educational programs reflects – and creates – a need within orthodoxy. It is not just a small cadre of women seeking these opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.gratz.edu/news-and-events/event-calendar/default-dynamic-news-page/%7Eboard/news-and-events/post/walderfellowshipcohort\">Programs continue to open</a> because there is a demand among Orthodox women for the chance to study rabbinic texts. As more institutions create programs for women, they are creating a new reality: one where Orthodox women are religious leaders.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261933/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michal Raucher received funding from the Israel Institute, the University of Cincinnati, and the Hadassah Brandeis Institute to conduct research related to this article.</span></em></p>",

And it’s easy to understand their appeal: Ask a question, get a polished synthesis and move on – it feels like effortless learning. </p>\n\n<p>However, a new paper I co-authored offers experimental evidence that this ease may come at a cost: When people rely on large language models to summarize information on a topic for them, they tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf316\">develop shallower knowledge</a> about it compared to learning through a standard Google search. </p>\n\n<p>Co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=x0S_vSgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Jin Ho Yun</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=1UnvjWoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">and I</a>, both professors of marketing, reported this finding in a paper based on seven studies with more than 10,000 participants. Most of the studies used the same basic paradigm: Participants were asked to learn about a topic – such as how to grow a vegetable garden – and were randomly assigned to do so by using either an LLM like ChatGPT or the “old-fashioned way,” by navigating links using a standard Google search. </p>\n\n<p>No restrictions were put on how they used the tools; they could search on Google as long as they wanted and could continue to prompt ChatGPT if they felt they wanted more information. Once they completed their research, they were then asked to write advice to a friend on the topic based on what they learned.  </p>\n\n<p>The data revealed a consistent pattern: People who learned about a topic through an LLM versus web search felt that they learned less, invested less effort in subsequently writing their advice, and ultimately wrote advice that was shorter, less factual and more generic. In turn, when this advice was presented to an independent sample of readers, who were unaware of which tool had been used to learn about the topic, they found the advice to be less informative, less helpful, and they were less likely to adopt it. </p>\n\n<p>We found these differences to be robust across a variety of contexts. For example, one possible reason LLM users wrote briefer and more generic advice is simply that the LLM results exposed users to less eclectic information than the Google results. To control for this possibility, we conducted an experiment where participants were exposed to an identical set of facts in the results of their Google and ChatGPT searches. Likewise, in another experiment we held constant the search platform – Google – and varied whether participants learned from standard Google results or Google’s AI Overview feature. </p>\n\n<p>The findings confirmed that, even when holding the facts and platform constant, learning from synthesized LLM responses led to shallower knowledge compared to gathering, interpreting and synthesizing information for oneself via standard web links.  </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Why did the use of LLMs appear to diminish learning? One of the most fundamental principles of skill development is that people learn best when they are <a href=\"https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10321235\">actively engaged with the material</a> they are trying to learn. </p>\n\n<p>When we learn about a topic through Google search, we face much more “friction”: We must navigate different web links, read informational sources, and interpret and synthesize them ourselves. </p>\n\n<p>While more challenging, this friction leads to the development of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-3445.136.4.569\">deeper, more original mental representation</a> of the topic at hand. But with LLMs, this entire process is done on the user’s behalf, transforming learning from a more active to passive process.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p>To be clear, we do not believe the solution to these issues is to avoid using LLMs, especially given the undeniable benefits they offer in many contexts. Rather, our message is that people simply need to become smarter or more strategic users of LLMs – which starts by understanding the domains wherein LLMs are beneficial versus harmful to their goals. </p>\n\n<p>Need a quick, factual answer to a question? Feel free to use your favorite AI co-pilot. But if your aim is to develop deep and generalizable knowledge in an area, relying on LLM syntheses alone will be less helpful. </p>\n\n<p>As part of my research on the psychology of new technology and new media, I am also interested in whether it’s possible to make LLM learning a more active process. In <a href=\"https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/4/10/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgaf316/1/pgaf316_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1766054688&amp;Signature=Xqnv2Q42RUMys-17wZLGfTGKhagRvNecWWw-ddF%7EhNg3mAoMm1ZM78-4Smt7VMdTPH7o3vWWBPA%7Et-5SYa26yPR8%7E1WYsyJ7Q0FGgvubbfC776neCu-W7g4uocv8Yr70xDwGVecHCVEYp7nA8louP2qbTV0FCeho5rx9CWyG%7EJJf29NmkWhfuNMpWkrTSpC-8aiH-G4bAviyW3dgCw5eKHV81063yz6ebK9tueV18tjDGxY1ke05g9MRcKlJfThQTHTiNW9-eN6dUPFvxGasGkw-GxdNKfTDyVv8cJfXY6HI1TCmJHALTM4oam-H5vIVvSzmmvZC7vWZZ2R7XRky6A__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA\">another experiment</a> we tested  this by having participants engage with a specialized GPT model that offered real-time web links alongside its synthesized responses. There, however, we found that once participants received an LLM summary, they weren’t motivated to dig deeper into the original sources. The result was that the participants still developed shallower knowledge compared to those who used standard Google.</p>\n\n<p>Building on this, in my future research I plan to study generative AI tools that impose healthy frictions for learning tasks – specifically, examining which types of guardrails or speed bumps most successfully motivate users to actively learn more beyond easy, synthesized answers. Such tools would seem particularly critical in secondary education, where a major challenge for educators is how best to equip students to develop foundational reading, writing and math skills while also preparing for a real world where LLMs are likely to be an integral part of their daily lives. </p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269760/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shiri Melumad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Imagine a kink in a hose that prevents water passing through it.

When stents are not available, we use powerful medications called thrombolytics, or clot-busters, to break down the thrombus. These kinds of treatments seem commonplace today, but it wasn’t until 1988 that a pivotal study showed combining aspirin and streptokinase, a clot-buster drug, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(88)92833-4\">improved survival after a heart attack</a> by almost 50%. </p>\n\n<p>Cheney had additional heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. Notably, all but the last were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2009.11928531\">during election years</a>, underscoring the detrimental effects of stress on heart health. His heart attack in 2000 occurred as the courts worked to determine whether Al Gore or George W. Bush – with whom Cheney would become vice president – <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/04/dick-cheney-heart-attacks-modern-medicine/87083844007/\">had won the presidential election</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As technology advanced over the years, Cheney had multiple <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22060-angioplasty\">angioplasties</a> – a procedure to open up narrowed or blocked arteries. During an angioplasty, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25270/con.2020.03.00024\">procedure developed in the 1980s</a>, heart doctors would place a balloon made of flexible polymers inside an artery to open up and clear the thrombus.   </p>\n\n<p>While angioplasties were helpful, one of the main limitations was that the walls of the artery would quickly shrink back – known as recoiling – after the balloon was deflated.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration showing treatment of clogged arteries with three steps of angioplasty procedure\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Angioplasties are procedures used to improve blood flow by widening narrowed or blocked arteries.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/steps-of-angioplasty-with-stent-balloon-in-royalty-free-illustration/2161114389?phrase=heart%20stent&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Rujirat Boonyong/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How stents became mainstream</h2>\n\n<p>That limitation led to the concept of stents – devices that are now frequently used to treat heart attack patients. </p>\n\n<p>Cheney’s first heart attack in 1978 occurred <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.24875/RECICE.M24000463\">well before the first stents</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM19870319316120\">became available</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stents started out as metal, tubelike structures that cardiologists used to open up narrowed or blocked blood vessels. The original stents, made of stainless steel, fixed the problem of blood vessels recoiling. </p>\n\n<p>But over time, cardiologists found that stents become stenotic, meaning they themselves would become narrow, making it difficult for blood to flow through them. This problem was solved with the introduction of drug-eluting stents, which have a polymer that coats the metal struts of a stent and prevents stenosis from occurring. </p>\n\n<p>Drug-eluting stents were a game-changer and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.0000127110.49192.72\">reduced the need for repeated procedures</a> by about 50% to 70%. Like millions of Americans, Cheney received several stents during his long battle with heart disease.  </p>\n\n<p>While stents are helpful, sometimes patients require a surgery called <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\">coronary artery bypass graft</a>. Heart surgeons perform this procedure when there are blockages that angioplasty or a stent cannot fix, or when there are too many blockages in the heart arteries. </p>\n\n<p>In 1988, at age 47, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10772800\">Cheney underwent a quadruple bypass operation</a> to help restore blood flow to his heart following his third heart attack.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a metal stent for implantation into blood vessels.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Example of a stent being deployed in an artery with stenosis, or narrowing as a result of plaque buildup.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/stent-illustration-royalty-free-illustration/1423887795?phrase=heart%20stent&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Christoph Burgstedt/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Battling heart disease</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the best efforts of cardiologists, many patients with heart disease, like Cheney, go on to develop heart failure. </p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">two main types of heart failure</a>. One – called <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/what-is-heart-failure/types-of-heart-failure\">heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</a> – occurs when the left ventricle, the largest and strongest chamber of the heart, becomes stiff and unable to relax.</p>\n\n<p>The other type – <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/what-is-heart-failure/types-of-heart-failure\">heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</a> – occurs when the left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened, and fails to pump blood efficiently. </p>\n\n<p>Both types of heart failure make it difficult for the heart to adequately pump blood throughout the body. Cheney, like millions of people throughout the world, suffered from a dilated and weakened heart.  </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, now there are several classes of medications used to treat the kind of heart failure that Cheney suffered from.   </p>\n\n<p>There are four main types of drugs that heart failure cardiologists use to manage patients with this condition, which are referred to as the “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">four pillars” of heart failure management</a>. These medications work together to reduce the amount of stress placed on the heart and to create an environment that helps a weakened heart pump blood <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">more efficiently throughout the body</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to these four medication types, millions of patients with dilated, weak hearts are living much longer with a higher quality of life and staying out of the hospital. Some of these medications are also used for patients with stiffened hearts, but there is a lot of ongoing research to better understand how to take care of patients with that kind of heart failure.  </p>\n\n<p>Despite the use of medications to treat dilated, weak hearts, some patients suffer from continued weakening of the heart muscle and progress to <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/living-with-heart-failure-and-managing-advanced-hf/advanced-heart-failure\">end-stage, or advanced, heart failure</a>. When this happens, there are only two treatment options available. These options are a mechanical pump or a heart transplant.</p>\n\n<p>Heart transplantation is the gold-standard, preferred treatment option for advanced heart failure that results from a dilated, weakened heart.   </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, there were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajt.2025.01.024\">about 4,500 heart transplants in the U.S.</a> and about 2,200 in Europe. On average, patients live well <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2014/02/dick-cheney-on-his-heart-transplant-its-the-gift-of-life-itself.html\">over a decade with a heart transplant</a>, and many will go on to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17087-heart-transplant\">live for 20 to 30 more years</a>.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A smiling woman adjusts her bicycle helmet while a man on a bike sips from a water bottle in the background\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Major health organizations recommend 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-beautiful-senior-couple-on-bike-ride-in-royalty-free-image/2174119314?phrase=heart%20disease%20&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</h2>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-023-01839-3\">famously quipped</a>, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  </p>\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dick-cheneys-heart/\">interview with “60 Minutes</a>” in 2013, Cheney said his heart disease was the result of genetics and an unhealthy lifestyle. He admitted that he drank beer, ate fatty foods and also smoked three packs of cigarettes per day. </p>\n\n<p>Millions of people across the U.S. and Europe have a lifestyle that is similar to that of Cheney’s prior to his heart transplant. While heart patients benefit from medications, stents and surgeries, <a href=\"https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf\">preventive strategies cannot be underestimated</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Almost all major health organizations, <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults\">including the American Heart Association</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html\">American Cancer Society</a> and the Department of Health and Human Services, recommend 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. </p>\n\n<p>This recommendation translates to a brisk walk about 30 minutes per day, five days per week. This level of exercise leads to large increases in survival and preservation of overall health throughout a lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>While Cheney lived through five heart attacks, the goal for patients and their doctors is to avoid the first. Scientific advances in cardiology have led to a dramatic improvement in survival and quality of life for millions of people, but preventive measures are still by far the most effective lifesaving measure.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269081/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>William Cornwell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In recent years, social psychologists such as <a href=\"https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book\">Jonathan Haidt</a> have started to draw connections between tech use and anxiety. They argue that the ubiquity of smartphones and social media may affect not only the habits and emotions of young people but also key aspects of their brain development during adolescence.</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining a constant online presence can result in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.2020.1743228\">excessive social comparison</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-024-01481-9\">disrupted sleep</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans\">fragmented attention</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.674298\">increased exposure to cyberbullying</a> – all of which can increase the prevalence of anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6eJfXioAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">public health and policy researchers</a> with an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1li36vMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">interest in mental health</a>. We understand that this problem goes well beyond youthful angst. Evidence increasingly links this type of prolonged anxiety to a number of detrimental health issues, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16996-1_6\">weakened immune function</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-016-0739-5\">increased cardiovascular risk</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-01986-4\">impaired cognitive performance</a>. Over time, these effects can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.9817\">increase the risk of chronic illness and other negative health outcomes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, in May 2025 we <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-health-anxiety-supplement-survey-results-2025.pdf\">conducted our own survey</a> to measure the prevalence of anxiety in the state where we live, Florida, and explore whether it is, in fact, related to age and social media use.</p>\n\n<h2>What our survey asked</h2>\n\n<p>We surveyed 500 adults, and we designed our research to ensure that our survey group matched the state’s population in terms of age, race, gender, political affiliation and geographic distribution.</p>\n\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://adaa.org/sites/default/files/GAD-7_Anxiety-updated_0.pdf\">a questionnaire called the GAD-7</a>, which was developed by mental health professionals to assess symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. The GAD-7 asks participants to identify how bothered they were about seven items during the past two weeks. They answered on a four-point scale, from “not at all” to “nearly everyday.” These seven items included questions on worrying, irritability, restlessness and feeling afraid or on edge.</p>\n\n<p>A score under 10 indicates minimal (0-4) or mild (5-9) anxiety. Those who score between 10 and 14 exhibit moderate anxiety, while a score of 15 or higher is indicative of a severe anxiety disorder. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between moderate and severe generalized anxiety corresponds to how often the participant experiences any of the seven items. For example, someone with severe generalized anxiety might experience all seven items nearly every day, while someone with moderate generalized anxiety might have experienced some of the items several days in the past two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>We also asked participants about how much time they spend on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and how they feel while using these platforms.</p>\n\n<h2>What we found</h2>\n\n<p>Our survey found that roughly 1 in 5 Floridians are struggling with moderate to severe anxiety, which is consistent with <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder\">national statistics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the average GAD-7 score was 4.74 – this would indicate that the “average” Floridian doesn’t have an anxiety disorder – 18.6% of participants reported symptoms of at least moderate anxiety, with nearly half of them rising to the level of severe.</p>\n\n<p>This result tells us that nearly 3.5 million Floridians may suffer from clinically significant anxiety.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Dzfp1\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Dzfp1/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Members of <a href=\"https://www.beresfordresearch.com/age-range-by-generation/\">Generation Z</a>, ages 18 to 27 in our sample, reported the highest rates of anxiety by a significant margin. In fact, the average GAD-7 score for this group was 8.17 – just below the threshold for moderate anxiety – compared with an average of 6.50 for millennials, 5.32 for Gen Xers and 3.04 for baby boomers. </p>\n\n<p>These averages track with previous nationwide studies, which have found that the portion of the U.S. adult population that suffers the most anxiety are members of Gen Z. According to a study conducted in 2020, 30.9% of adults ages 18 to 23 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10804-023-09442-x\">reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms</a>, compared to only 27.9% of millennials, 17.2% of Gen Xers and 8.1% of baby boomers.</p>\n\n<h2>Social media and anxiety in Gen Z</h2>\n\n<p>In order to understand whether social media use might help explain the higher rates of anxiety we observed among younger Floridians, we examined the relationship between time spent on social media and anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>In general, those who didn’t use social media at all reported lower levels of anxiety, with an average GAD-7 score of 3.56. In comparison, the average GAD-7 score for those who use social media less than one hour per week was 3.74, and it rose consistently as social media use increased, climbing to an average of 6.10 among those who spent seven to nine hours a week on social media, and 7.08 for those who were logged on for 10 hours or more.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"1h0tZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1h0tZ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>While time spent was important, the reasons why Floridians use social media also made a big difference in whether they experienced anxiety. Anxiety was lowest among those who use social media primarily to stay connected with family and friends. But it rose significantly among those who use social media to stay up to date with current trends and pop culture or to learn about health, fitness and beauty trends.</p>\n\n<p>We also asked respondents whether they “sometimes feel like they’re missing out when they see what others post on social media.” Among those who agreed that they sometimes get social media <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i19.4881\">FOMO</a>, average anxiety scores ranged between 7.26 and 9.00. But among those who disagreed, average scores were significantly lower – 4.16 or less.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"76hNb\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/76hNb/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Time spent on social media matters for young people</h2>\n\n<p>In this data, we see a clear correlation between social media use and heightened anxiety, and we also see a greater tendency for Gen Zers and millennials to report higher levels of anxiety. This makes sense, given that younger people generally spend more time on social media.</p>\n\n<p>But one important question remained to be answered: Can reducing social media use lead to lower rates of anxiety for the youngest adults? </p>\n\n<p>In order to answer this question, we reexamined the relationship between average weekly social media use and anxiety. But this time, we restricted the analysis to only those respondents who were members of the Gen Z and millennial groups.</p>\n\n<p>Even when the study was restricted to just these two groups, we found a clear and decisive link between social media use and anxiety. Those who reported spending less than one hour on social media each week had average GAD-7 scores of 2.89. Those scores rose consistently as time on social media increased, reaching a high of 8.73 among those who use social media 10 hours or more per week.</p>\n\n<h2>Moderating intake to bring down anxiety</h2>\n\n<p>The results of our survey appear to confirm the suspicions of social psychologists and techno-critics – namely, that the high rates of anxiety observed among younger Americans appear to be connected to their time online. This is particularly true for those spending time in digital spaces that facilitate social comparison and information overload.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be sure from just this survey that social media alone is to blame for increased generalized anxiety. Other factors may be involved, such as digital information overload and a decline in person-to-person contact. But the amount of time spent on social media does appear to be affecting the mental health of young people in Florida. </p>\n\n<p>One potential solution may be to moderate intake. Some emerging research has suggested <a href=\"https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/yvcb5y06/release/2\">setting up automated daily reminders</a> to limit social media use to 30 minutes a day. Another suggestion includes occasionally <a href=\"https://www.annalembke.com/dopamine-nation\">taking a monthlong break from social media</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Those who feel they need more support taking time off social media may benefit from seeking professional help, such as talking with a licensed therapist.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263010/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephen Neely receives funding from the Florida Center for Cybersecurity for this study</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kaila Witkowski receives funding from the Florida Center for Cybersecurity for this study. </span></em></p>",

On the afternoon of Nov. 18, 2025, the House voted overwhelmingly to seek release of the files, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/11/18/us/trump-epstein-files-news\">only one Republican voting against the measure</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/house-vote-epstein-files.html?smid=url-share\">The Senate later in the day agreed unanimously</a> to pass the measure and send it on to the president for his signature; Trump signed it on Nov. 19. The Conversation’s politics editor, Naomi Schalit, talked with scholar Alex Hinton, <a href=\"https://sasn.rutgers.edu/alex-hinton\">who has studied MAGA for years</a>, about Make America Great Again Republicans’ sustained interest in the case of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Hinton explains how MAGA’s interest in the case fits into what he knows about the group of die-hard Trump supporters.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You are an expert on MAGA. How do you learn what you know about MAGA?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://sasn.rutgers.edu/alex-hinton\">a cultural anthropologist</a>, and what we do is field work. We go where the people we’re studying live, act, talk. We observe and sort of hang out and see what happens. We listen and then we unpack themes. We try and understand the meaning systems that undergird whatever group we’re studying. And then, of course, there’s interviewing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit with a crowd behind him stands at a microphone-covered lectern that has a sign 'EPSTEIN FILES TRANSPARENCY ACT' written on it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703215/original/file-20251118-76-l4n0du.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Rep.

Are they, in fact, concerned about this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The answer is yes, but there’s also a sort of “no” implicit, too. We need to back up and think, first of all, what is MAGA. </p>\n\n<p>I think of it as what we call in anthropology a nativist movement, a foregrounding of the people in the land. And this is where you get <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/what-exactly-meant-america-first-1866209\">America First discourse</a>. It’s also xenophobic, meaning that there’s a fear of outsiders, invaders coming in. It’s populist, so it’s something that’s sort of for the people. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.happyscribe.com/the-tucker-carlson-show/tucker-and-mtg-on-the-5-pillars-of-maga-and-the-snakes-in-washington-trying-to-tear-them-down\">Tucker Carlson interviewed Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, and he said, “I’m going to go over the five pillars of MAGA.” Those were America First, this is absolutely central. Borders was the second. You’ve got to secure the borders. The third was globalist antipathy, or a recognition that globalization has failed. Another one was free speech, and another one he mentioned was no more foreign wars. And I would add into that an emphasis on “we the people” versus elites. </p>\n\n<p>Each of those is interwoven with a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/maga-media-conspiracy-theories-put-120855227.html\">key dynamic to MAGA, which is conspiracy theory</a>. And those conspiracy theories are usually anti-elite, going back to we the people. </p>\n\n<p>If you look at Epstein, he’s where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx5xzy8kn1o\">many of the conspiracy theories converge</a>: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-55009950\">Stop the Steal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/power-of-trumps-big-lie-identity-fusion-internalizing-misinformation-and-support-for-trump/AF2A0DBE08319E0E3944825E187EDBCC\">The Big Lie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/prosecute-the-architects-of-trump-lawfare-for-election-interference/\">lawfare</a>, <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EA1C41B2CE4E423BC9AFBB36640AE430/9781009355285c4_170-195.pdf/trump-and-after.pdf\">deep state</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/g-s1-22583/trump-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory\">replacement theory</a>. Epstein kind of hits all of these, that there’s this elite cabal that’s orchestrating things that ultimately are against the interests of we the people, with a sort of antisemitic strain to this. And in particular, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/09/why-maga-is-obsessed-with-jeffrey-epstein-00134394\">if we go back to Pizzagate in 2016</a>, this conspiracy theory that there were these Democratic elitists who were, you know, demonic forces who were sex trafficking, and lo and behold, here’s Epstein doing precisely that.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4VWeTTBYKg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking case has fueled MAGA fears and conspiracy theories. Anthropologist Alex Hinton has been talking and listening to MAGA followers for years, and he breaks down the many reasons Epstein’s case is important to them.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>There’s kind of a bucket of these things, and Epstein is more in it than not in it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>He’s all over it. He’s been there, you know, from the beginning, because he’s elite and they believe he’s doing sex trafficking. And then there’s a suspicion of the deep state, of the government, and this means cover-ups. What was MAGA promised? <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">Trump said, we’re going to give you the goods</a>, right? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5508871/trump-bondi-epstein-files-release-history\">Kash Patel, Pam Bondi, everyone said</a> we’re going to tell you this stuff. And it sure smacks of a cover-up, if you just look at it.</p>\n\n<p>But the bottom line is there’s a realization among many people in MAGA that you’ve got to stay with Trump. It’s too much to say there is no MAGA without Trump. There’s certainly no Trumpism without Trump, but MAGA without Trump would be like the tea party. It’ll just sort of fade away without Trump. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/politics/trump-epstein-republican-care-poll\">People in MAGA are supporting Trump</a> more than more mainstream Republicans on this. So I don’t think there’s going to be a break over this, but it certainly adds strain. And you can see in the current moment that Trump is under some strain.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A blond woman in a red hat speaks at a microphone while a man in a suit stands behind her, with American flags behind him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep.

You fall apart, you have tension, and then you sort of get back. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elon-musk-backs-off-from-feud-with-trump-saying-he-regrets-social-media-posts-that-went-too-far\">Elon Musk was a little bit like that</a>. You have this breakup, and now she’s sort of backtracking like Elon Musk did. I don’t think what is happening is indicative of a larger fracturing that’s going to take place with MAGA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It seems that Trump did his about-face on releasing the documents so that MAGA doesn’t have to break with him.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s absolutely true. He’s incredible at taking any story and turning it in his direction. He’s sort of like a chess player, unless he blurts something out. He’s a couple of moves ahead of wherever, whatever’s running, and so in a way we’re always behind, and he knows where we are. It’s incredible that he’s able to do this. </p>\n\n<p>There’s one other thing about MAGA. I think of it as “don’t cross the boss.” It’s this sort of overzealous love of Trump that has to be expressed, and literally no one ever crosses the boss in these contexts. You toe the line, and if you go against the line, you know what happened to Marjorie Taylor Greene, there’s the threat Trump is going to disown you. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-threatens-primary-indiana-republicans-173838011.html\">You’re going to get primaried</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has probably made a brilliant strategic move, which is suddenly to say, “I’m all for releasing it. It’s actually the Democrats who are these evil elites, and now we’re going to investigate Bill Clinton and all these other Democrats.” He takes over the narrative, he knows how to do it, and it’s intentional. Whoever says Trump is not charismatic, he doesn’t make sense – Trump is highly charismatic. He can move a crowd. He knows what he’s doing. Never underestimate him. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Does MAGA care about girls who were sexually abused?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is concern, you know, especially among the devout Christians in MAGA, for whom sex trafficking is a huge issue. </p>\n\n<p>I think if you look at sort of notions of Christian morality, it also goes to notions of sort of innocence, being afflicted by demonic forces. And it’s an attack on we the people by those elites; it’s a violation of rights. I mean, who isn’t horrified by the idea of sex trafficking? But again, especially in the Christian circles, this is a huge issue.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270109/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alex Hinton receives funding from the Rutgers-Newark Sheila Y.

Today, American trees produce <a href=\"https://esmis.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/release-files/5425kg32f/nv936p236/00001m546/pecnpr24.pdf\">hundreds of million of pounds</a> of pecans – <a href=\"https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/nuts/pecans\">80% of the world’s pecan crop</a>. Most of that crop stays here. Pecans are used to produce pecan milk, butter and oil, but many of the nuts end up in pecan pies. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout history, pecans have been overlooked, poached, cultivated and improved. As they have spread throughout the United States, they have been eaten raw and in recipes. Pecans have grown more popular over the decades, and you will probably encounter them in some form this holiday season. </p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1A45uDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">an extension specialist</a> in Oklahoma, a state consistently ranked fifth in pecan production, behind <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/pecan-production-by-state\">Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.</a> I’ll admit that I am not a fan of the taste of pecans, which leaves more for the squirrels, crows and enthusiastic pecan lovers. </p>\n\n<h2>The spread of pecans</h2>\n\n<p>The pecan is a nut <a href=\"https://www.hardwoodinfo.com/specifying-professionals/species-guide/species-guide-h-z/hickory-pecan/\">related to the hickory</a>.

Three years later, George Washington’s estate, Mount Vernon, had some planted pecans. <a href=\"https://www.uapress.ua.edu/9780817388966/pecan/\">Washington loved pecans</a>, and Revolutionary War soldiers said he was constantly eating them.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, no one needed to plant pecans in the South, since they naturally grew along riverbanks and in groves. Pecan trees are alternate bearing: They will have a <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/pecan-crop-load-management.html\">very large crop one year</a>, followed by one or two very small crops. But because they naturally produced a harvest with <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">no input from farmers</a>, people did not need to actively cultivate them. Locals would harvest nuts for themselves but otherwise ignored the self-sufficient trees.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until the late 1800s that people in the pecan’s native range realized the pecan’s potential worth for income and trade. Harvesting pecans <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">became competitive</a>, and young boys would climb onto precarious tree branches. One girl was lifted by a hot air balloon so she could beat on the upper branches of trees and let them fall to collectors below. <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">Pecan poaching</a> was a problem in natural groves on private property. </p>\n\n<h2>Pecan cultivation begins</h2>\n\n<p>Even with so obvious a demand, cultivated orchards in the South were still rare into the 1900s. Pecan trees don’t produce <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/training-pecan-trees.html\">nuts for several years</a> after planting, so their future quality is unknown. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two lines of trees\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An orchard of pecan trees.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/beautiful-rows-of-pecan-trees-on-orchard-farm-in-royalty-free-image/1695762143?phrase=pecan%20tree&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Jon Frederick/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To guarantee quality nuts, farmers began using a technique called grafting; they’d join branches from quality trees to another pecan tree’s trunk.

To keep pecan quality up and produce consistent annual harvests, today’s pecan growers <a href=\"https://www.uaex.uada.edu/counties/white/news/horticulture/pecan-load-management.aspx\">shake the trees</a> while the nuts are still growing, until about half of the pecans fall off. This reduces the number of nuts so that the tree can put more energy into fewer pecans, which leads to better quality. Shaking also evens out the yield, so that the alternate-bearing characteristic doesn’t create a boom-bust cycle.</p>\n\n<h2>US pecan consumption</h2>\n\n<p>The French brought praline dessert with them when they immigrated to Louisiana in the early 1700s. A praline is a flat, creamy candy made with nuts, sugar, butter and cream.

One cup of pecan halves has about <a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-search\">9 grams of protein</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After the wars, pecan demand declined, resulting in millions of excess pounds at harvest. One effort to increase demand was a national pecan recipe contest in 1924. Over 21,000 submissions came from over 5,000 cooks, with <a href=\"https://lancasteronline.com/features/800-proved-pecan-recipes/article_4e7e036c-6a87-11e4-9d79-43e3bd34d9db.html\">800 of them published in a book</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Pecan consumption went up with the inclusion of pecans <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">in commercially prepared foods</a> and the start of the mail-order industry in the 1870s, as pecans can be shipped and stored at room temperature.

Small amounts of pecans contain many vitamins and minerals. They became commonplace in cereals, which touted their health benefits. </p>\n\n<p>In 1938, the federal government published the pamphlet Nuts and How to Use Them, which touted pecans’ nutritional value and came <a href=\"https://ia801906.us.archive.org/20/items/nutswaystousethe302whit/nutswaystousethe302whit.pdf\">with recipes</a>. Food writers suggested using pecans as shortening because they are composed mostly of fat. </p>\n\n<p>The government even put a price ceiling on pecans to encourage consumption, but consumers weren’t buying them.

And 24 million households report having had to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%2011.1.pdf\">forgo food or medicine</a> at least once in the past year to pay utility bills.</p>\n\n<p>Also, studies indicate that people facing high energy burdens often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205356119\">turn to unsafe heating sources</a>, such as space heaters, stoves or fireplaces, and are at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.08.011\">higher risk of</a> asthma, depression, premature mortality and poor self-reported health. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">Our recent study</a> of 2019 data found that those burdens are not spread evenly across the country or across society. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, families living in majority-Black census tracts spent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">5.1% of their income on energy</a> – significantly higher than the 3.2% share spent by average American households. Census tracts dominated by other racial groups in our study – whites, Latinos and Asian Americans – were much closer to the overall average.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26032696/embed\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26032696/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/26032696\" target=\"_top\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\"> </a></div>\n\n<h2>Energy injustice</h2>\n\n<p>Often, disparities like this are attributed to income, which is indeed a factor given that Black households have a <a href=\"https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/united-states-median-household-income-by-race/\">median income of $53,444</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/united-states-median-household-income/\">overall median in the U.S. is $78,538</a>. However, our study found that even when a majority-white and a majority-Black census tract had the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">same median household income</a>, the average share of household income spent on energy was higher in the majority-Black census tract.</p>\n\n<p>We found two possible reasons for this difference, both rooted in race and housing situations.</p>\n\n<p>First, our analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that African American-majority census tracts have older homes on average than other census tracts. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9951\">Older homes often have lower energy efficiency</a> due to less insulation, single-pane windows, and gaps and cracks in the building’s structure, especially around windows, doors and chimneys. So even if a Black family earns the same income as another family, the Black family might live in an older house, requiring them to use more energy to warm or cool their homes, cook food, heat water and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we found that Black families are more likely to live in rental properties, where they cannot easily make energy-efficiency upgrades – such as installing new windows, insulation or appliances. At the same time, most landlords <a href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/2024-04-24/landlords-renters-incentive-climate-action\">do not have an incentive</a> to spend money to improve building efficiency because tenants usually pay utility bills. In the United States, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%209.2.pdf\">9 in 10 rental households pay for all or some of their energy bills</a> and therefore face this split-incentive problem.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A close-up of brickwork near a window, showing cracks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cracks around windows can allow cold air inside.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/damages-cracked-red-brown-brick-wall-at-window-royalty-free-image/2189953242\">Robbie Becklund/iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many of these challenges can be attributed to the structural racism inherent in <a href=\"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/\">redlining</a>. This early 20th century practice made it harder for prospective homeowners to get mortgages to buy homes in neighborhoods with high concentrations of Black people, immigrants or other minorities. That left more of the homes in those communities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118180\">owned by landlords and occupied by tenants</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even though redlining was banned in 1968, it left a <a href=\"https://ncrc.org/holc/\">legacy of underinvestment</a> in properties, <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/home-values-redlined-areas-19674/\">decreased property values</a> and <a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/articles/spotlight/research/50-years-after-being-outlawed-redlining-still-drives-neighborhood-health-inequities\">worse health outcomes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Intersecting inequities</h2>\n\n<p>Other factors also likely intersect to impose a higher energy burden on Black families. Many of these were beyond the scope of our study but are well documented. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2202/1944-2858.1095\">energy support programs are notoriously underfunded and often hard to access</a>, especially for families without the time or connections to know about them or understand application requirements.</p>\n\n<p>These are just some possible factors that increase the energy burden for Black families. The main lesson for policymakers is that communities are complicated. Energy efficiency upgrade programs that also seek to alleviate high energy burdens cannot be one-size-fits-all. A program for middle-class families in one neighborhood may not work in another community with older housing stock or large numbers of rental units. </p>\n\n<p>To be successful, local officials designing programs that are aimed at  families’ energy burdens will have to learn about the different challenges facing each distinct community – whether it’s leaky older homes, outdated water heaters, low incomes or rental split incentives. Reducing energy burdens for Black families will take more than technical fixes; it will take policies based in community engagement to build a deeper understanding of place.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269047/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

These funding cuts were further exacerbated by the extensive <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/all-government-shutdowns-disrupt-science-in-2025-the-consequences-extend-far-beyond-a-lapse-in-funding-267182\">2025 government shutdown</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a team of sociologists <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rZsAGT4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">studying universities</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KgTHhTMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">higher education policy and administration</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b7-cGVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">academic freedom</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PiwNMGkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">science production</a>, we recognized these cuts as part of a recent global trend of weakened academic freedom. Since the mid-2000s, political attacks on higher education have increased in many countries. Consequently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25593/open-fau-1637\">academic freedom has declined</a> in countries as different as India, Israel, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom, <a href=\"https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/resources/free-to-think-2025/\">among others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, for years Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán accused the internationally respected <a href=\"https://www.ceu.edu\">Central European University</a> of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45976454\">liberal bias</a>.” By 2019, he had effectively forced the university and its faculty into exile in Vienna, Austria. Since Argentinian President Javier Milei came to power in 2023, he has made repeated <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-protests-universities-farright-explained-e442fecf9f66da7508b8686b756847d3\">claims that academics are corrupt elites</a>. He used this narrative to restrict universities’ autonomy and funding of their research programs.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/scientists-around-the-world-report-millions-of-new-discoveries-every-year-but-this-explosive-research-growth-wasnt-what-experts-predicted-237274\">most research is done collaboratively</a>. But research finds that when <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298370\">individual scholars have less academic freedom</a> and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5460496\">universities’ autonomy declines</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.22\">global research collaborations are also threatened</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The prevalence and complexity of those collaborations that optimize human and material resources has grown, with substantial impact on scientific productivity — what we call the global “collaboration dividend.” Collaborations foster solutions to complex problems, from vaccine development to renewable energy. Diminishing academic freedom erodes these collaboration dividends, which then reduces the quantity and quality of scientific discovery worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-concerning-status-higher-education-teaching-personnel\">recommendation concerning the status of higher education teaching personnel</a> builds on Article 26 of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and urges governments to protect academics from political surveillance and interference on two levels.</p>\n\n<p>First, UNESCO affirms the right of individual faculty to teach, research, share findings and express their expert opinions independently. Second, UNESCO recognizes the right of universities to autonomously make decisions about facilitating research, hiring and promoting faculty, and developing curricula without state interference.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic freedom and global collaborations</h2>\n\n<p>Data from <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/our-work/research-programs/academic-freedom/\">the Varieties of Democracy, or V-DEM, project</a> demonstrate international trends in academic freedom. V-DEM is a large, widely used international dataset based on experts evaluating political developments. It tracks infringements and protections of these rights in every country over the past hundred years. The index we used measures dimensions of academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Suppressed in the 1930s by <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/great-depression\">global economic depression</a>, <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-02695-4.html?srsltid=AfmBOorZr5Co-C7mTXGdIzq-6Xbz-8xndQgI1zUr72TLlwD54IutCmSC\">rising fascism and military conflict</a>, academic freedom reached a low point during World War II. It then rebounded and grew strongly. </p>\n\n<p>More countries began recognizing the benefits of free inquiry and guaranteed independent science, especially from 1980 to the mid-2000s. Nations everywhere expanded the capacity of their universities to undertake scientific research and collaborate across boundaries. <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/books/edited-volume/12050/The-Century-of-ScienceThe-Global-Triumph-of-the\">A new global model of the research university</a> fostered the exponential growth of scientific knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"f9yvF\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f9yvF/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Also, in part as a defense against totalitarianism, many countries signed on to international agreements upholding academic freedom, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-economic-social-and-cultural-rights\">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. This agreement declares that the basic human right to an education “can only be enjoyed if accompanied by the academic freedom of staff and students.” </p>\n\n<p>The strengthening of academic freedom paralleled the largest historical expansion of the world’s capacity to undertake research on science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine, or STEMM. But over the past decade, freedoms of faculty members and universities began to weaken in many countries, including in the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/5-growing-threats-to-academic-freedom-230185\">United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/global-mega-science\">university-based scientists co-author 85% to 90%</a> of the several million STEMM research papers produced annually. Large, complex collaborations are increasingly a driving force in discovery. The global expansion of academic freedom enables universities and their scientists to participate in this intensifying collaboration dividend through joint research with colleagues elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>In studies published between 2024 and 2025, we presented troubling trends about declining academic freedom, collaborations and scientific research at universities in countries across the world. </p>\n\n<p>First, we analyzed individual academic freedom and STEMM production in 17 research productive countries from 1981 to 2007. We found that academic freedom protections <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298370\">raise the quantity and quality of research</a>, while infringements on these safeguards lower them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we found that safeguarding universities’ organizational autonomy also <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5460496\">increases the volume and excellence</a> of a country’s STEMM research output. Both associations are independent of other influential factors behind countries’ scientific productivity, such as governmental research spending, a country’s wealth or university enrollments.</p>\n\n<p>Third, a related study by others finds that restricting academic freedom <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.22\">reduces scientists’ and universities’ ability</a> to effectively participate in international research collaborations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A screen showing the headshots of three researchers at a Nobel Prize announcement ceremony.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nobel Prizes often are awarded to interorganizational and/or international teams of researchers, such as the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde\">Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency via AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Diminishing the collaboration dividend</h2>\n\n<p>Together, these findings underscore that academic freedom allows researchers to participate in complex collaborations, which in turn increases research production. Most of these collaborations aren’t just facilitated by individual scientists, however. Global collaborations are made up of networks of universities, and declining academic freedom can threaten the ties between these institutions and their scientists’ projects. </p>\n\n<p>The popular image of the solitary genius making isolated breakthroughs is largely a myth. Research teams have steadily increased in size, and “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2478/jdis-2023-0015\">super-collaborative” groups</a> of hundreds or even thousands of scientists now work together on complex projects. Together, they produce ever greater amounts of knowledge. Because individual researchers’ output is fairly steady over their careers, real productivity gains in science now <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16835\">depend on global collaboration and shared resources</a>. This is true even as the number of scientists grows. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Research collaborations spanning the globe, with research hubs of mostly universities visible (mapping of bibliographic pairs on the basis of Scopus data).</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Olivier H.

This number grew to 193 countries by 2010. Currently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-025-09602-1\">over a fourth of the millions of annual STEMM papers</a> are the result of international collaborations. This process is heavily dependent on universities and their freedom to pursue science.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, superhubs can accelerate international collaboration for scientists in other countries not originally in these hubs. Such collaborations enable their universities to leapfrog into new superhub status. <a href=\"https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/28573\">South Korean universities</a> have been an example of this process over the past several decades.</p>\n\n<p>This collaborative capacity has enabled the production of millions of co-authored papers and scientific advances. For instance, these collaborations allowed for the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.101\">rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Collaborative networks depend on university support, not just individual scientists. This is why our research suggests declining academic freedom at the university level makes them vulnerable. A troubling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00938-y\">three-quarters of U.S.-based scientists</a> have considered leaving the country in response to threats against academic freedom in the U.S. since early 2025. </p>\n\n<p>This research suggests that at stake here is not only the freedom of scholars and academic institutions, but also the future of discovery itself. Academic freedom is essential for scientists around the world to collaborate, enabling the scientific discoveries necessary for technological innovation, medical breakthroughs, and social and environmental problem-solving.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266644/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Volha Chykina has received funding from Mellon Foundation / Scholars at Risk to support her research on academic freedom.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David P.

You’re exhausted but elated. The view of the city below is gorgeous, and you want to capture the moment on camera. But it’s already quite dark, and you’re not sure you’ll get a good shot. Fortunately, your phone has an AI-powered night mode that can take stunning photos even after sunset. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s something you might not know: That night mode may have been trained on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.02715\">synthetic nighttime images</a>, computer-generated scenes that were never actually photographed.</p>\n\n<p>As artificial intelligence researchers exhaust the supply of real data on the web and in digitized archives, they are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-synthetic-data-industry-debate-over-fake-2024-8\">increasingly turning to synthetic data</a>, artificially generated examples that mimic real ones. But that creates a paradox. In science, making up data is a cardinal sin. Fake data and misinformation are already undermining trust in information online. So how can synthetic data possibly be good? Is it just a polite euphemism for deception?</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ttbl4FsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">machine learning researcher</a>, I think the answer lies in intent and transparency. Synthetic data is generally not created to manipulate results or mislead people. In fact, ethics may require AI companies to use synthetic data: Releasing real human face images, for example, can violate privacy, whereas <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.061\">synthetic faces</a> can offer similar benefit with formal privacy guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>There are other reasons that help explain the growing use of synthetic data in training AI models. Some things are so scarce or rare that they are barely represented in real data. Rather than letting these gaps become an Achilles’ heel, researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV45572.2020.9093570\">can simulate those situations instead</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another motivation is that collecting real data can be costly or even risky. Imagine collecting data for a self-driving car during storms or on unpaved roads. It is often much more efficient, and far safer, to <a href=\"https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/auto-self-driving-safety-report.pdf\">generate such data virtually</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIusawrGBN4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Here’s a quick take on what synthetic data is and why researchers and developers use it.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How synthetic data is made</h2>\n\n<p>Training an AI model requires large amounts of data. Like students and athletes, the more an AI is trained, the better its performance tends to be. Researchers have known for a long time that if data is in short supply, they can use a technique known as <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/complete-guide-data-augmentation\">data augmentation</a>. For example, a given image can be rotated or scaled to yield additional training data. Synthetic data is data augmentation on steroids. Instead of making small alterations to existing images, researchers create entirely new ones.</p>\n\n<p>But how do researchers create synthetic data? There are two main approaches. The first approach relies on rule-based or <a href=\"https://rendered.ai/why-synthetic-data-is-used-to-train-computer-vision/\">physics-based models</a>. For example, the laws of optics can be used to simulate how a scene would appear given the positions and orientations of objects within it. </p>\n\n<p>The second approach uses <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3275134\">generative AI to produce data</a>. Modern generative models are trained on vast amounts of data and can now create remarkably realistic text, audio, images and videos. Generative AI offers a flexible way to produce large and diverse datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Both approaches share a common principle: If data does not come directly from the real world, it must come from a realistic model of the world. </p>\n\n<h2>Downsides and dangers</h2>\n\n<p>It is also important to remember that while synthetic data can be useful, it is not a panacea. Synthetic data is only as reliable as the models of reality it comes from, and even the best scientific or generative models <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/streamline-accelerate-ai-initiatives-synthetic-data\">have weaknesses</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers have to be careful about potential biases and inaccuracies in the data they produce. For example, researchers may simulate the home-insurance ecosystem to help detect fraud, but those simulations could embed unfair assumptions about neighborhoods or property types. The benefits of such data must be weighed against risks to fairness and equity.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also important to maintain a clear distinction between models and simulations on one hand and the real world on the other. Synthetic data is invaluable for training and testing AI systems, but when an AI model is deployed in the real world, its performance and safety should be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.03257\">proved with real, not simulated, data</a> for both technical and ethical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Future research on synthetic data in AI is likely to face many challenges. Some are ethical, some are scientific, and others are engineering problems. As synthetic data becomes more realistic, it will be more useful for training AI, but it will also be easier to misuse. For example, increasingly realistic synthetic images can be used to create convincing <a href=\"https://security.virginia.edu/deepfakes\">deepfake videos</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that researchers and AI companies should keep clear records to show which data is synthetic and why it was created. Clearly disclosing which parts of the training data are real and which are synthetic is a key aspect of responsibly producing AI models. California’s law, “<a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2013\">Generative artificial intelligence: training data transparency</a>,” set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, requires AI developers to disclose if they used synthetic data in training their models.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.03257\">Researchers should also study</a> how mistakes in simulations or models can lead to bad data. Careful work will help keep synthetic data transparent, trustworthy and reliable. </p>\n\n<h2>Keeping it real</h2>\n\n<p>Most AI systems learn by finding patterns in data. Researchers can improve their ability to do this by adding synthetic data. But AI has no sense of what is real or true. The desire to stay in touch with reality and to seek truth belongs to people, not machines. <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/publications/reducing-risks-posed-synthetic-content-overview-technical-approaches-digital-content\">Human judgment and oversight</a> in the use of synthetic data will remain essential for the future.</p>\n\n<p>The next time you use a cool AI feature on your smartphone, think about whether synthetic data might have played a role. Our AIs may learn from synthetic data, but reality remains the ultimate source of our knowledge and the final judge of our creations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265180/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ambuj Tewari receives funding from NSF and NIH.</span></em></p>",

A group of students started the first Black student union in 1968 at San Francisco State University. This happened during the <a href=\"https://africana-studies.williams.edu/student-work/revitalizing-the-black-campus-movement/\">Black Campus Movement</a>, when Black college students advocated for themselves, making demands for resources, respect, spaces and programs to <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-black-revolution-on-campus/paper\">support Black student life</a>. At the time, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17541328.2011.625195\">Mariana Waddy</a>, a student at San Francisco State University and the first president of a Black student union, said, “This college had done little for Black students except try to whitewash them.” </p>\n\n<p>Black students wanted to make the school more engaging and responsive to their needs. </p>\n\n<p>Today, these student unions are essential for Black student life on college campuses. They offer a place of belonging, where Black students can figuratively exhale from a predominately white campus or student environment. Black student life on campus isn’t a given – just because there are Black students, it doesn’t mean there is a Black student community. These unions allow Black students to come together as a community.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What do these unions look like and do, day to day?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Black student unions largely operate independently. They have various events, like cookouts and parties. If a campus is dealing with an issue or some kind of racist occurrence, for example, Black student union leaders will come to the forefront to be an advocate for Black students. They try to engage with students and university leaders on whatever is happening. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How are political pressure and policy shifts influencing these unions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/09/29/students-alumni-rally-keep-cut-affinity-programs-alive\">University of Utah</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/black-student-unions-us-schools\">University of Alabama</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/black-student-unions-us-schools\">announced in 2024</a> that they would no longer fund or support their schools’ Black student unions. Universities typically give these unions a certain amount of money, as they do with other student-led groups. With this funding pulled, it is going to make it harder for Black student unions to exist. Where are they going to meet? Will they have to pay for a place to meet off campus? </p>\n\n<p>And if you want to encourage students to come to Black student events, you will likely want to have food for them. If you want to arrange a trip to a conference or host a movie night, those things cost money and require space.</p>\n\n<p>These cuts have drained time, energy and resources from Black student unions. </p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.northerniowan.com/23450/black-history-month/black-student-union-is-filling-the-gaps/\">Black student leaders</a> are <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/09/29/students-alumni-rally-keep-cut-affinity-programs-alive\">filling gaps</a> where funding, staff, spaces and infrastructure used to exist to support and meet the needs of Black student life.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\">administration’s attempts</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei\">remove funding</a> from and shut down diversity, equity and inclusion programs could lead Black student union leaders to act as <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/segregation-or-student-support\">unpaid diversity workers</a> if and when these positions at universities are eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>This work also involves organizing social events and support services for Black students. It means continuing to creatively advocate for Black student needs.  </p>\n\n<p>Full-time students leading Black student unions now find themselves doing unpaid labor that helps sustain Black communities and the universities that profit from them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How exactly are universities profiting from Black student unions’ work?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Here’s one example: <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/B/Black-Campus-Life2\">I observed</a> a university tapping student leaders from a Black engineering group to represent the university’s school of engineering at public events. These leaders might have had to skip class or lose study time to be available for this event. But the university wanted other people, including prospective Black students, to know that there were already Black students at this school. </p>\n\n<p>Black students in these positions have mentioned to me that sometimes administrators will pressure them to show up for panels and other events as a form of marketing. I think most of these requests are well-meaning. But I also know that Black student representatives and leaders place pressure on themselves to also show up for their community and school. </p>\n\n<p>Their presence and visibility help universities have a more welcoming environment. They have an active, vibrant community because of Black student unions and leaders. Organizations like this create community and lead to more positive experiences for students. This <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/785238\">joy can lead</a> to more students staying in school. </p>\n\n<p>If I am a Black parent touring a college with my child and don’t see any Black students participating in the tour or on campus, that sends a message to a prospective Black student – will I, or my child, belong here? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What message are Black student unions receiving with these policy shifts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the message to Black student unions is that you all have to fend for yourselves. That is what inequality is all about, having different expectations for different students. </p>\n\n<p>Cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion work signals to Black students that they are not valued and that, if they want to have meaningful experiences as a Black student community, they will have to do this work themselves. You can discern an institution’s values in their budget priorities. If there is nothing being materially invested in Black students, how can you say you support them?</p>\n\n<p>My research shows that Black students act independently to achieve their goals. They create <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/rhe.2021.0003\">places of joy</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0042085920971354\">and belonging</a> for themselves and others, <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/B/Black-Campus-Life2\">navigating institutions</a> to create full, dynamic lives.</p>\n\n<p>Black students have historically played the cards they were dealt, even if they were inequitable. They have worked to create traditions and lives within and outside of higher education’s campus walls. Some Black student unions may look different going forward, but I have full faith they will continue.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268754/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Antar A.

That’s because in the early 2000s, researchers analyzed data from a study called the Women’s Health Initiative and reported that hormone therapy increased the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.288.3.321\">risk of breast cancer, heart disease, blood clots and stroke</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.20.2651\">cognitive decline after menopause</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After this research was first published in 2002, the use of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000143826.38439.af\">hormone therapy fell by 46% within six months</a> – both because clinicians were reluctant to prescribe it and patients were fearful of taking it. In 2003, the FDA added <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-black-box-warning-a-pharmacologist-explains-how-these-labels-protect-patients-269470\">black box warnings</a> – the most serious  warnings, indicating a risk of serious harm or death – to all estrogen-containing hormone products for menopause.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rtxnj-0nqVs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The FDA announced on Nov. 10, 2025, that it will ask drug companies to remove ‘black box’ warnings from hormone therapy for menopause.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But researchers soon <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.010\">pointed out methodological flaws</a> in the analysis. And over the past two decades, careful reanalyses of data from that study, as well as newer studies, have shown that systemic hormone therapy <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005553\">is very safe for most women</a>, though there are nuances surrounding its use.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, women’s health experts have been increasingly vocal in the past five years in <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinicians-call-easing-fda-warnings-low-dose-estrogen-2024a100093t\">calling to remove the black box warnings</a> from a form of hormone menopause therapy that’s applied locally, not systemically. <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19770-estradiol-vaginal-cream\">Topical localized estrogen</a> is applied directly to the vagina and surrounding areas, usually in the form of a cream or vaginal insert. It’s used to treat <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7586\">the genitourinary syndrome of menopause</a>, which manifests as genital and urinary symptoms. </p>\n\n<p>Even though <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.41743\">topical estrogen products are extremely safe</a> and were not evaluated in the Women’s Health Initiative study, the FDA warnings were added to them, too. </p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025\">the FDA held an expert panel</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005553\">what’s currently known</a> about the risks and benefits of  hormone therapy for menopause. At the meeting, most experts urged the agency to remove the warning labels on topical vaginal estrogen products. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604283/fda-menopause-hormone-therapy\">Nov. 10 announcement</a> was the outcome of that discussion, and it included both systemic and topical hormone therapy. </p>\n\n<h2>Why is systemic estrogen no longer considered unsafe?</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers are now finding that the balance of risks and benefits of systemic hormone therapy for menopause seems to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2016.01.004\">depend strongly on when someone starts hormones</a>, as well as the type, dose and length of use.  </p>\n\n<p>For women under 60 or within 10 years of their final period, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/menopause-treatments-can-help-with-hot-flashes-and-other-symptoms-but-many-people-arent-aware-of-the-latest-advances-230376\">the therapy is much safer</a> than it is for older women. A 2017 follow-up of Women’s Health Initiative participants showed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.11217\">overall deaths from any causes actually decreased</a> in this younger cohort of menopausal women taking hormones.  </p>\n\n<p>For women who are more than 10 years from their final menstrual period, starting hormone therapy may <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.4510\">increase their risk of cardiovascular disease</a>. Researchers now refer to this as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/menopause-start-estrogen-replacement-therapy-sooner-to-reduce-heart-disease-116890\">the timing hypothesis</a>. Newer studies <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1505241\">also support this idea</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Also, some ways of delivering hormones to the body turned out to be safer than others. Taking estrogen orally, as pills or tablets, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.642280\">carries a higher risk of blood clots</a>. Those risks go away when it’s delivered through the skin using a patch, gel or spray. Many more options for hormone therapy exist today than in the early 2000s.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it’s well established that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001831\">hormone therapy improves bone health</a> by preventing bone loss. Some studies suggest that in younger menopausal women, it may actually <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hormone-therapy-may-cut-cardiovascular-risk-in-younger-menopausal-women-243561\">protect against cardiovascular disease</a>, though this link is not yet proven and needs more study.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many people missed out on the timing window. In my practice, I see patients who went through menopause 10 or 15 years ago and either didn’t get hormone therapy at the time or stopped taking it when the initial Women’s Health Initiative results came out. Now, they are hearing about the benefits, and many want to try it. But their higher cardiovascular risk may overshadow the benefit.</p>\n\n<h2>What about topical estrogen?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001609\">Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is ubiquitous</a> – it affects every person with ovaries who goes through menopause, and the symptoms tend to worsen with age.</p>\n\n<p>They include vaginal dryness, painful sex and urinary issues such as an increase in urgency or frequency, along with incontinence. Urinary tract infections often tend to get <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/utis-after-menopause-why-theyre-common-and-what-to-do-about-them\">more frequent with menopause</a>, particularly in older women. Treating them can require multiple courses of antibiotics.</p>\n\n<p>Tissues in the genitourinary area are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1888320/\">loaded with estrogen receptors</a> – proteins in cells that bind the hormone. So adding some estrogen back to these areas can help restore the quality and thickness of these tissues, and possibly even promote the growth of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.08.006\">healthy bacteria around the vagina</a> and the urinary tract. The treatment can greatly improve quality of life and promote better health and longevity.</p>\n\n<p>Despite topical estrogen’s safety and effectiveness, the FDA did not distinguish between it and systemic estrogen when adding the black box warnings in 2003. For this reason, many providers whose patients have symptoms relating to the genitourinary syndrome of menopause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2025.103129\">have been reluctant to prescribe it</a>. Often, providers simply don’t know that it has a different safety profile than systemic estrogen.</p>\n\n<h2>How will removing the black box warnings affect patients?</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I see this as a big win for women and their ability to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002028\">manage the symptoms of menopause</a>. I think this will make clinicians and patients far less anxious about prescribing and taking this medication.</p>\n\n<p>Clinicians like me who specialize in women’s health and menopause – and who have been following the research – have been safely prescribing hormone therapy all along. But many general practitioners who often lacked either menopause-specific training or the time and resources to stay on top of the latest findings have been more reluctant to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns that led to the black box warnings, especially in regard to local vaginal estrogen, have turned out to be overblown. While clinicians still need to consider who is a good candidate for systemic hormone use, the evidence shows that for most people, it is a safe option. </p>\n\n<p>Even more important, patients who were previously convinced that hormone therapy was unsafe may feel more comfortable discussing it with their provider and considering it. And if they do receive a prescription for hormone therapy, I hope that the likelihood of them starting this effective treatment is no longer <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-025-06246-3\">hindered by reading a scary package insert</a> that was based on outdated evidence. </p>\n\n<p>While this medication is not a silver bullet that reverses aging, starting hormones at the right time can safely improve symptoms that diminish people’s quality of life. So if you’re having symptoms that are bothersome, consider asking your provider about menopause hormone therapy to help manage them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269773/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Genevieve Hofmann has participated in advisory boards with Astellis Pharma and Mayne Pharma.

Hackman had been living with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9164-alzheimers-disease\">Alzheimer’s</a> and depended on Arakawa as his full-time caregiver.</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly, postmortem data suggests that Arakawa died of complications from <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351838\">pulmonary Hantavirus</a> several days before her husband passed. The discordant times of death point to a grim scenario: Hackman was left alone and helpless, trapped in his home after his wife’s death.</p>\n\n<p>The couple’s story, while shocking, is not unique. It serves as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.7404\">a warning for our rapidly aging society</a>. The U.S. population <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/population/older-aging.html\">is aging</a>, but most Americans are <a href=\"https://www.johnhancock.com/ideas-insights/longevity-preparedness-index.html\">not adequately planning to meet the needs of older adulthood</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://experts.umich.edu/6511-kahli-zietlow\">geriatric physician and medical educator</a>, I care for older adults in both inpatient and outpatient settings. My research and clinical work focus on dementia and surrogate decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, regardless of race, education or socioeconomic status, there are some universal challenges that all people face with aging and there are steps everyone can take to prepare.</p>\n\n<h2>Aging is inevitable but unpredictable</h2>\n\n<p>Aging is an unpredictable, highly individualized process that varies depending on a person’s genetics, medical history, cognitive status and socioeconomic factors.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of older Americans report <a href=\"https://ihpi.umich.edu/news-events/news/most-older-adults-say-theyve-experienced-ageism-majority-still-hold-positive\">a strong sense of purpose and self-worth</a>. Many maintain a <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/why-so-many-older-americans-rate-their-health-as-good-or-even-excellent/\">positive view of their overall health</a> well into their 70s and 80s.</p>\n\n<p>But at some point, the body starts to slow down. Older adults experience gradual sensory impairment, loss of muscle mass and <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/03/memory-age-dementia-healthy-brain.html\">changes in their memory</a>. <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/most-common-chronic-health-conditions.html\">Chronic diseases</a> are more likely with advancing age.</p>\n\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table?q=disability\">46% of adults over age 75</a> live with at least one physical disability, and this proportion grows with age. Even those without major health issues may find that routine tasks like yard work, housekeeping and home repairs become insurmountable as they enter their 80s and 90s.</p>\n\n<p>Some may find that subtle changes in memory make it difficult to manage household finances or keep track of their medications. Others may find that vision loss and slowed reaction time make it harder to safely drive. Still others may struggle with basic activities needed to live independently, such as bathing or using a toilet. All of these changes threaten older adults’ ability to remain independent.</p>\n\n<h2>The costs of aging</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/what-lifetime-risk-needing-receiving-long-term-services-supports\">Nearly 70% of older Americans</a> will require long-term care in their lifetime, whether through paid, in-home help or residence in an assisted living facility or nursing home.</p>\n\n<p>But long-term care is expensive. In 2021, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program <a href=\"https://www.ltcfeds.gov/long-term-care/costs\">reported that the average hourly rate</a> for in-home care was US$27. An assisted living apartment averaged $4,800 per month, and a nursing home bed cost nearly double that, at a rate of $276 per day.</p>\n\n<p>Many Americans may be shocked to discover that these costs are not covered by Medicare or other traditional medical insurance. Long-term care insurance covers the cost of long-term care, such as in-home care or nursing home placement. However, what is covered varies from plan to plan. Currently, only a small minority of Americans have long-term care insurance due to <a href=\"https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-much-does-long-term-care-insurance-cost-and-is-it-worth-it/\">high premiums and complex activation rules</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am not aware of any high-quality, peer-reviewed studies that have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of long-term care insurance. Yet, for many Americans, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/the-affordability-of-long-term-care-and-support-services/\">paying for care out of pocket is simply not an option</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/long-term-services-supports\">Medicaid can provide</a> financial support for long-term care but only for older adults <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/what-is-the-difference-between-medicare-medicaid/index.html\">with very low income and minimal assets</a> – criteria most Americans don’t meet until they have nearly exhausted their savings. </p>\n\n<p>Those receiving Medicaid to cover the costs of long-term care have essentially no funds for anything other than medical care, room and board. And proposed federal financial cuts <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/one-big-beautiful-bill-nursing-homes/\">may further erode the limited support services available</a>. In Michigan, for example, <a href=\"https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/personal-needs-allowance/\">Medicaid-covered nursing home residents</a> keep only $60 per month for personal needs. If individuals receive monthly income greater than $60 – for instance, from Social Security or a pension – the extra money would go toward the cost of nursing home care.</p>\n\n<p>Those who don’t qualify for Medicaid or cannot afford private care often rely on family and friends for unpaid assistance, but not everyone has such support systems.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A nurse helps an older man shave.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Older adults may end up needing help with day-to-day personal care.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/healthcare-worker-assisting-senior-man-in-shaving-royalty-free-image/1343269576?phrase=eldercare&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Planning for the care you want</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond financial planning, older adults can make an <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/advance-care-planning/advance-care-planning-advance-directives-health-care\">advance directive</a>. This is a set of legal documents that outlines preferences for medical care and asset management if a person becomes incapacitated. However, <a href=\"https://ihpi.umich.edu/news-events/news/older-michiganders-need-more-help-planning-long-term-care-needs-poll-shows\">only about 25% of Americans over 50</a> have completed such documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Without medical and financial powers of attorney in place, state laws determine who makes critical decisions, which may or may not align with a person’s wishes. For instance, an estranged child may have more legal authority over an incapacitated parent than their long-term but unmarried partner. Seniors without clear advocates risk being placed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17797\">under court-appointed guardianship</a> – a restrictive and often irreversible process.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to completing advance directives, it is important that older adults talk about their wishes with their loved ones. Conversations about disability, serious illness and loss of independence can be difficult, but these discussions allow your loved ones to advocate for you in the event of a health crisis.</p>\n\n<h2>Who’s going to care for you?</h2>\n\n<p>Finding a caregiver is an important step in making arrangements for aging. If you are planning to rely on family or friends for some care, it helps to discuss this with them ahead of time and to have contingency plans in place. As the Hackman case demonstrates, if a caregiver is suddenly incapacitated, the older adult may be left in immediate danger.</p>\n\n<p>Caregivers experience higher rates of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2053833\">stress, depression and physical illness</a> compared with their peers. This is often exacerbated by financial strain and a lack of support. It helps if the people you will be relying on have expectations in place about their role.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, some people may prefer placement in a facility rather than relying on a loved one if they can no longer use the bathroom independently. Others may wish to remain in their homes as long as this is a feasible option.</p>\n\n<h2>Connecting with available resources</h2>\n\n<p>There are local and federal initiatives designed to help aging adults find and get the help they need. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recently launched the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/guide\">GUIDE Model</a> to improve care and quality of life for both those suffering from dementia and their caregivers. </p>\n\n<p>This program connects caregivers with local resources and provides a 24-hour support line for crises. While GUIDE, which stands for Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience, is currently in the pilot stage, <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/medicare-guide-program-for-dementia-caregivers/\">it is slowly expanding</a>, and I am hopeful that it will eventually expand to provide enhanced coverage for those suffering from dementia nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npaonline.org/what-is-pace-care\">Program for All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly</a> helps dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid recipients remain at home as they age. This program provides comprehensive services including medical care, a <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/home-care/adult-day-care/\">day center</a> and home health services.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eldercare.acl.gov/home\">Area agencies on aging</a> are regionally located and can connect older adults with local resources, based on availability and income, such as meals, transportation and home modifications that help maintain independence.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, all of these programs and others that support older adults are threatened by recent federal budget cuts. The tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which was signed into law in July 2025, will result in <a href=\"https://www.maynardnexsen.com/publication-nursing-homes-feeling-mixed-effects-after-one-big-beautiful-bill-enacted\">progressive reductions to Medicaid funding over the next 10 years</a>. These cuts will decrease the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid and negatively affect how nursing homes are reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p>The government funding bill passed on Nov. 13 <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-signs-government-funding-bill-ending-record-43-day-shutdown\">extends current Medicare funding</a> through Jan. 30, 2026, at which point <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/9-major-medicare-changes-for-2026-whats-coming-for-premiums-drug-prices-and-program-cuts-11831673\">Medicare funding may be reduced</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even as the future of these programs remains uncertain, it’s important for older adults and their caregivers to be intentional in making plans and to familiarize themselves with the resources available to them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259237/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kahli Zietlow receives funding from Health Resources and Services Administration via grant 1 K01HP49055‐01‐00</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>’Tis the season for giving – and that means ’tis the season for shopping. Maybe you’ll splurge on a Black Friday or Cyber Monday deal, thinking, “I’ll just return it if they don’t like it.” But before you click “buy,” it’s worth knowing that many retailers have quietly tightened their return policies in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/about/our-leaders-and-scholars/faculty-and-academic-divisions/faculty-profiles/lauren-beitelspacher.php\">marketing professor</a>, I study how retailers manage the flood of returns that follow big shopping events like these, and what it reveals about the hidden costs of convenience. Returns might seem like a routine part of doing business, but they’re anything but trivial. According to the National Retail Federation, returns cost U.S. retailers <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/consumers-expected-to-return-nearly-850-billion-in-merchandise-in-2025\">almost US$890 billion each year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Part of that staggering figure comes from returns fraud, which includes everything from consumers buying and wearing items once before returning them – <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/wardrobing-retail-fraud-soars-in-the-summer.html\">a practice known as “wardrobing</a>” – to more deceptive acts such as falsely claiming an item never arrived. </p>\n\n<p>Returns also drain resources because they require <a href=\"https://www.ascm.org/topics/reverse-logistics/\">reverse logistics</a>: shipping, inspecting, restocking and often repackaging items. Many returned products can’t be resold at full price or must be liquidated, leading to lost revenue. Processing returns also adds labor and operational expenses that erode profit margins.</p>\n\n<h2>How e-commerce transformed returns</h2>\n\n<p>While retailers have offered return options <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/return-policy-retail/422145/\">for decades</a>, their use has expanded dramatically in recent years, reflecting how much shopping habits have changed. Before the rise of e-commerce, shopping was a sensory experience: Consumers would touch fabrics, try on clothing and see colors in natural light before buying. If something didn’t work out, customers brought it back to the store, where an associate could quickly inspect and restock it.</p>\n\n<p>Online shopping changed all that. While e-commerce offers convenience and variety, it removes key sensory cues. You can’t feel the material, test the fit or see the true color. The result is uncertainty, and with uncertainty comes higher rates of returns. One analysis by Capital One suggests that the rate for returns is <a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/average-retail-return-rate/\">almost three times higher</a> for online purchases than for in-store purchases.</p>\n\n<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the move toward online shopping <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html\">went into overdrive</a>. Even hesitant online shoppers had to adapt. To encourage purchases, many retailers introduced or expanded generous return policies. The strategy worked to boost sales, but it also created a culture of returning.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, returns accounted for <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/428-billion-merchandise-returned-2020\">10.6% of total U.S. retail sales</a>, nearly double the prior year, according to the National Retail Federation data. By 2021, that had <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/25/retailers-average-return-rate-jumps-to-16point6percent-as-online-sales-grow-.html\">climbed to 16.6%</a>. Unable to try things on in stores, consumers began ordering multiple sizes or styles, keeping one and sending the rest back. The behavior was rational from a shopper’s perspective but devastatingly expensive for retailers. </p>\n\n<h2>The high cost of convenience</h2>\n\n<p>Most supply chains are designed to move in one direction: from production to consumption. Returns reverse that flow. When merchandise moves backward, it adds layers of cost and complexity.</p>\n\n<p>In-store returns used to be simple: A customer would take an item back to the store, the retailer would inspect the product, and, if it was in good condition, it would go right back on the shelf. Online returns, however, are far more cumbersome. Products can spend weeks in transit and often can’t be resold – by the time they arrive, they may be out of season, obsolete or no longer in their original packaging.</p>\n\n<p>Logistics costs compound the problem. During the pandemic, consumers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.02.020\">grew accustomed to free shipping</a>. That means retailers now often pay twice: once to deliver the item and again to retrieve it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in a post-pandemic world, retailers are trying to strike a balance – maintaining customer goodwill without sacrificing profitability. One solution is to raise prices, but especially today, with inflation in the headlines, shoppers are sensitive to price hikes. The other, more common approach is to tighten return policies.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, that’s taken several forms. Some retailers have begun charging small flat fees for returns, even when a customer mails an item back at their own expense. For example, the direct-to-consumer retailer Curvy Sense offers customers unlimited returns and exchanges of an item <a href=\"https://curvysense.com/products/free-unlimited-returns-exchanges?srsltid=AfmBOopwIGPsdaTEhpdXGoaMZQ0KbRGTGBXNB40Tso_34sYNV1VXTNuW\">for an initial $2.98 price</a>. Others have shortened their return windows. Over the summer, for example, beauty retailers Sephora and Ulta reduced their return window <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/retail/sephora-and-ulta-beauty-quietly-changed-their-return-polices\">from 60 days to 30</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Many brands now attach large, conspicuous “do not remove” tags to prevent consumers from wearing items and then sending them back. And increasingly, retailers are offering store credit rather than cash or credit card refunds, ensuring that returned sales at least stay within their company.</p>\n\n<p>Few retailers advertise these changes prominently. Instead, they appear quietly in the fine print of return policies – policies that are now longer, more specific and far less forgiving than they once were.</p>\n\n<p>As we head into the busiest shopping season of the year, it’s worth pausing before you click “purchase.” Ask yourself: Is this something I truly want – or am I planning to return it later?</p>\n\n<p>Whenever possible, shop in person and return in person. And if you’re buying online, make sure you familiarize yourself with the return policy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266975/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lauren Beitelspacher does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Typically laden with delicious foods, it’s not uncommon to eat more during the holidays than you usually would.  </p>\n\n<p>You likely know that feeling of being too stuffed – the point when you’re pleasantly satisfied one moment and uncomfortably full the next. On top of that physical discomfort can come extra helpings of guilt for eating more than you wanted or expected.   </p>\n\n<p>The physical and psychological pressure of holiday meals can be challenging. <a href=\"https://miamioh.edu/profiles/ehs/bryn-beeder.html\">As a registered dietitian</a>, I want to assure you that your body <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works\">knows what to do with that extra food and drink</a>, and that your overall health and well-being are defined by much more than a few days of indulgence. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.worldhappiness.report/ed/2025/sharing-meals-with-others-how-sharing-meals-supports-happiness-and-social-connections/\">experience of eating and sharing food</a> may play a valuable role in creating lasting, positive memories of the holiday season.  </p>\n\n<p>Still, if you’ve ever wondered what’s happening inside your body after a big meal, you’re not alone. Understanding a bit about how digestion works can make the post-meal feelings a little less mysterious and a lot less stressful. </p>\n\n<h2>Slowing down digestion</h2>\n\n<p>Food is made up of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-macros-an-exercise-and-nutrition-scientist-explains-244265\">three main macronutrients</a>: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Your <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system\">gastrointestinal tract</a> uses both mechanical and chemical processes to break down these nutrients into their simplest form so they can be absorbed and used for energy, repair and carrying out biological functions.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person scooping a spoonful of peas from a table laden with Thanksgiving food\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702066/original/file-20251112-66-bc54c5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">It’s common to eat more than you usually would during a holiday gathering.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/teenage-girl-having-food-while-sitting-at-dining-royalty-free-image/1345177558\">The Good Brigade/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>When you eat a large holiday meal, you will likely consume more of all the macronutrients than you usually would, in a shorter period of time. The larger quantity of food will require a bit <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/frym.2024.1386116\">more time to digest</a>, meaning it will move more slowly along your GI tract. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594226/\">Protein and fats</a> also naturally take longer to break down. While more carbohydrate-rich foods, such as a granola bar or a glass of orange juice, give you a quick burst of energy, adding more protein- and fat-rich foods, such as eggs or chicken, to your meal provides energy that lasts longer.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the slower digestive process can actually be beneficial for steady energy and appetite control. </p>\n\n<h2>Physical discomfort</h2>\n\n<p>Rest assured, your <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works#whathappens\">digestive system</a> will carry on no matter how big the meal. Rather, the question is how long digestion will take and whether that may cause some temporary discomfort along the way. </p>\n\n<p>When you eat, your stomach stretches to accommodate the food you consumed. As the stomach works to pass food contents into the small intestine, there is an <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9617-heartburn-overview\">increased chance of heartburn</a> – a backflow of acidic stomach contents that can cause a burning sensation in your chest or sour taste in your mouth. Extra food can also lead to stomach pain, nausea, gas and bloating, as well as a general sluggish feeling.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person gripping stomach, stacked plates of mostly eaten food before them\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Digesting a large meal can be uncomfortable.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-with-bloating-and-stomach-pain-after-eating-royalty-free-image/2219960906\">seb_ra/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even before the first bite, your body begins preparing for digestion. The <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system\">first sight and smell of food</a> increases your body’s production of saliva and stomach acid in anticipation of the work ahead. </p>\n\n<p>When the workload is greater than usual, your body temporarily <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218769/\">expends more energy to fuel the digestive process</a>, both in breaking down macronutrients and in absorbing that fuel for use later. As a result, it is typical to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tired-after-eating\">feel more tired after a large meal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the physical discomfort of digestion, try <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223\">staying upright</a> after a meal. While lying down may be tempting, it can increase stomach pain and the risk of heartburn. Give your body time and let gravity work in your favor by staying upright for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001538\">at least two to three hours</a> after eating. A <a href=\"https://www.prevention.com/health/a64818569/does-walking-help-digestion/\">10- to 15-minute walk</a> can also be beneficial to the digestive process, increasing stomach contractions and overall blood flow to the GI tract. This can in turn move food out of the stomach and into the small intestine more efficiently. </p>\n\n<h2>Moving past food guilt</h2>\n\n<p>One day of indulgence alone will not cause permanent weight gain or lasting changes to your physical health. But repeated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100221\">patterns of food guilt</a> can, over time, lead to an unhealthy relationship to food.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond digestion, the way you think and talk about food can be just as important as how you feel after eating. <a href=\"https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/removing-food-morality/\">Food does not have moral value</a>, and yet it is easy to become caught in the habit of labeling foods as “good” or “bad.” This mindset often shows up during the holidays. Think about how often you hear yourself or others say, “I was good all morning so I can eat more tonight” or “I’m going to be bad and have the pie, too.” How you speak about food directly shapes how you feel about eating it and about yourself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three people sitting at a table eating and smiling at a dog asking for a bite\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Food nourishes your body and your relationships.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-looks-amused-as-a-friend-gives-in-and-gives-a-royalty-free-image/1391487579\">Catherine Falls Commercial/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Food can also bring <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tastes-from-our-past-can-spark-memories-trigger-pain-or-boost-wellbeing-heres-how-to-embrace-food-nostalgia-232826\">positive emotions and good memories</a>.

But focusing on cheating overlooks a larger set of ethical concerns that higher education institutions face, from the use of copyrighted material in large language models to student privacy.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://magazine.holycross.edu/stories/ai-course-delivers-few-answers-many-questions-and-even-more-discussion\">a sociologist who teaches about AI</a> and studies the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-us-really-is-unlike-other-rich-countries-when-it-comes-to-job-insecurity-and-ai-could-make-it-even-more-exceptional-261934\">impact of this technology on work</a>, I am well acquainted with research on the rise of AI and its social consequences. And when one looks at ethical questions from multiple perspectives – those of students, higher education institutions and technology companies – it is clear that the burden of responsible AI use should not fall entirely on students’ shoulders. </p>\n\n<p>I argue that responsibility, more generally, begins with the companies behind this technology and needs to be shouldered by higher education institutions themselves.</p>\n\n<h2>To ban or not to ban generative AI</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s start where some <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/09/17/how-college-ai-use-shifted-from-campuswide-bans-to-big-techs-playbook/\">colleges and universities did</a>: banning generative AI products, such as ChatGPT, partly over student academic integrity concerns. </p>\n\n<p>While there is evidence that <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai.html\">students inappropriately use this technology</a>, banning generative AI ignores research indicating <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07356331241277937\">it can improve college students’ academic achievement</a>. Studies have also shown generative AI may have <a href=\"https://contexts.org/blog/working-for-ai/\">other educational benefits</a>, such as for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2023.2244935\">students with disabilities</a>. Furthermore, higher education institutions have a responsibility to <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/ai-life-skills-colleges-workers/709640/\">make students ready for AI-infused workplaces</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Given generative AI’s benefits and its widespread student use, many colleges and universities today <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882125000052\">have integrated generative AI into their curricula</a>. Some higher education institutions have even provided students free access to these tools through their school accounts. Yet I believe these strategies involve additional ethical considerations and risks. </p>\n\n<p>As with previous waves of technology, the adoption of generative AI can exacerbate inequalities in education, given that not all <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-ai-keep-students-motivated-or-does-it-do-the-opposite-264728\">students will have access to the same technology</a>. If schools encourage generative AI use without providing students with free access, there will be a divide between students who can pay for a subscription and those who use free tools. </p>\n\n<p>On top of this, students using free tools <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-tools-collect-and-store-data-about-you-from-all-your-devices-heres-how-to-be-aware-of-what-youre-revealing-251693\">have few privacy guarantees in the U.S.</a> When they use these tools – even as simple as “Hey ChatGPT, can you help me brainstorm a paper idea?” – students are producing potentially <a href=\"https://contexts.org/blog/working-for-ai/\">valuable data that companies use to improve their models</a>. By contrast, paid versions can offer more data protections and clearer privacy guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Higher education institutions can address equity concerns and help protect student data by seeking licenses with vendors that address student privacy. These licenses can provide students with free access to generative AI tools and specify that student data is not to be used to train or improve models. However, they are not panaceas.</p>\n\n<h2>Who’s responsible now?</h2>\n\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/54122/teaching-ai\">Teaching with AI</a>,” José Antonio Bowen and C. Edward Watson argue that higher education institutions need to rethink their approach to academic integrity. I agree with their assessment, but for ethical reasons not covered in their book: Integrating generative AI into the curriculum through vendor agreements involves higher education institutions recognizing tech companies’ transgressions and carefully considering the implications of owning student data.  </p>\n\n<p>To begin, I find the practice of penalizing students for “stealing” words from large language models to write papers ethically difficult to reconcile with tech companies’ automated “scraping” of websites, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922\">such as Wikipedia and Reddit</a>, without citation. Big tech companies have used copyrighted material – some of it <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/08/30/claude-now-joins-openai-in-getting-sued-for-copyright-infringement/\">allegedly taken from piracy websites</a> – to train the large language models that power chatbots. Although the two actions – asking a chatbot to write an essay versus training it on copyrighted material – are not exactly the same, they both have a component of ethical responsibility. For technology companies, ethical issues such as this are <a href=\"https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063\">typically raised only in lawsuits</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For institutions of higher education, I think these issues should be raised prior to signing AI vendor licenses. As <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/sometimes-we-resist-ai-for-good-reasons\">a Chronicle of Higher Education article suggests</a>, colleges and universities should vet AI model outputs as they would student papers. If they have not done so prior to signing vendor agreements, I see little basis for them to pursue traditional “academic integrity” violations for alleged student plagiarism. Instead, higher education institutions should consider changes to their academic integrity policies. </p>\n\n<p>Then there is the issue of how student data is handled under AI vendor agreements. One likely source of student concern is whether their school, as a commercial customer and data owner, logs interactions with identifiers and can pursue academic integrity charges and other matters on this basis. </p>\n\n<p>The solution to this is simple: Higher education institutions can prominently display the terms and conditions of such agreements to members of their community. If colleges and universities are unwilling to do so, or if their leaders don’t understand the terms themselves, then maybe institutions need to rethink their AI strategies.   </p>\n\n<p>The above data privacy issues take on new meaning given the ways in which generative AI is currently being used, sometimes as “companions” with which people share highly personal information. OpenAI estimates that about <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/\">70% of ChatGPT consumer usage is for nonwork purposes</a>. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, recognizes that people are turning to ChatGPT for “<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">deeply personal decisions that include life advice, coaching and support</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Although the long-term effects of using chatbots as companions or confidants is unknown, the recent case of a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545749/ai-chatbots-safety-openai-meta-characterai-teens-suicide\">teen committing suicide while interacting with ChatGPT</a> is a tragic reminder of generative AI’s risks and the importance of ensuring people’s personal security along with their privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Formulating explicit statements that generative AI should be used only for academic purposes could help mitigate the risks related to students forming potentially damaging emotional attachments with chatbots. So, too, could reminders about campus mental health and other resources. Training students and faculty on all these matters and more can aid in promoting personally responsible AI use. </p>\n\n<p>But colleges and universities cannot skirt their own responsibilities. At some point, higher education institutions may see that such responsibility is too heavy of a cross to bear and that their risk-mitigation strategies are essentially Band-Aids for a systemic problem.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268167/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jeffrey C.

But <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2023.2171207\">my research</a> highlights <a href=\"https://www.naspa.org/blog/what-critical-frameworks-mean-for-how-we-collect-religious-secular-and/or-spiritual-identity-data\">the role of religion and spirituality</a>, too: how support for students’ worldviews – whether they’re deeply religious, atheist or somewhere in between – shapes their campus experience. </p>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64d3cd72bd1e28250d8f35cd/t/68f6d83ad42ed44582161bfc/1761007674586/UVA_+Sense+of+Belonging+Presentation.pdf\">recent scholarship</a> with fellow higher education professor <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/education/about/directory/musbah-shaheen\">Musbah Shaheen</a> argues that a sense of belonging arises mainly from meaningful relationships and conversations about those topics, not from simply having religious clubs and organizations on campus.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, we believe universities can move beyond tolerance toward real appreciation for all students, including religious minorities. </p>\n\n<h2>Foundational role of relationships</h2>\n\n<p>This recent work builds on results from the <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/research/ideals/\">Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey</a>, or IDEALS. In 2014, higher education researcher <a href=\"https://ced.ncsu.edu/people/anbryan2/\">Alyssa N. Rockenbach</a> and I designed the project in partnership with Interfaith America, a nonprofit that encourages interfaith dialogue on campus. Running from 2015 to 2019, it surveyed 3,486 students across 122 campuses to understand the ways colleges could support students’ well-being when it comes to their worldviews, religious identities and spiritual beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>A main theme emerged in students’ responses: Feeling cared about, accepted and valued on campus was <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IDEALS-2019-Friendships-Matter.pdf\">rooted in relationships</a>. But faculty and staff also had an important role to play in modeling respectful relationships and in helping students engage respectively with each other.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of young people, most of whom are Black, stand and sing in a large darkened auditorium.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jackson State University students worship during the Tigerville Gospel Explosion on April 13, 2025, in Jackson, Miss.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jackson-state-university-students-engage-in-praise-and-news-photo/2210257501?adppopup=true\">Aron Smith/Jackson State University via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Findings from the study also showed that campuses can help foster student <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/016146812112300706\">friendships across religions</a> by creating opportunities for students to engage with each other authentically. They can try to make sure campus conversations about religion and spirituality are built on trust, <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/853532\">not proselytizing or coercion</a>. They can offer opportunities for students from different religious backgrounds to participate in <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ideals-20182.pdf\">service-learning experiences, leadership opportunities and interfaith programs</a>, to name a few. </p>\n\n<p>Respectful relationships are especially important for religious minorities’ sense of belonging. A campus’s climate is often shaped by Christian heritage in ways many students may not even notice: chapels, sometimes repurposed as classroom space; dining halls that don’t offer halal or kosher meals; and academic calendars that prioritize certain religious holidays over others. </p>\n\n<p>Apart from addressing these issues head-on, there are other ways to help offset these dynamics. In the IDEALS study, students who reported having supportive spaces for challenging but respectful dialogues – where they could share perspectives without feeling coerced or harmed – with peers who hold differing worldviews <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/research/ideals/\">felt a greater sense of belonging</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The answer is not to avoid tough conversations. Instead, it is to ensure they are guided and productive. In this sense, strong academic engagement matters: involving faculty both in and out of the classroom, as one means of helping students engage with one another respectfully.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic support</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to the IDEALS survey, we had a sense of what matters to students in making their worldview feel respected on campus.

This ongoing project is a multiyear exploration into the factors institutions have in place to support the well-being of students with a wide range of beliefs. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young men and women stand in rows outside at night, some of them bent forward in prayer.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jewish students and allies hold a Shabbat and a prayer in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian students encampment at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., on April 26, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jewish-students-and-allies-hold-a-shabbat-and-a-davening-news-photo/2149787944?adppopup=true\">Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The sample included data from 318 colleges and universities. Thirty-one percent were public, while 69% were private. Any university can sign up for the assessment, free of cost, so 174 of these schools have participated multiple times to understand how their campus’s climate is changing – whether it’s becoming more welcoming, and for whom. </p>\n\n<p>Our team used student responses to the IDEALS surveys to develop scales, measuring how welcoming campuses are for students from diverse spiritual backgrounds. We then rated schools from 1 to 5 – the highest rating – on several different areas, such as religious accommodations and efforts to combat hate and intolerance. </p>\n\n<p>One of the most important categories is academic engagement – specifically, how institutions formalize practices designed to foster two things. The first is interfaith literacy: <a href=\"https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/what-we-do/our-approach/what-religious-literacy\">knowledge and understanding of diverse religious traditions</a>. The second is dialogue: structured opportunities for interaction among people of different religious, spiritual and secular beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>The data shows that most schools have lots of room for improvement when it comes to academic engagement about religion. Using the 1-5 scale, 19% of institutions scored a 1, and 33% of schools scored just a 2. Another 30% scored a 3. Seventeen percent scored a 4 – and only two out of the 318 received a 5.</p>\n\n<p>More than 52% of institutions are in the lowest two levels, highlighting the lack of campuswide academic initiatives that foster belonging.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A student's light blue cap has 'My success is only by Allah' penned on it in Arabic and English.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A student wears a graduation cap with a verse from the Quran written on it at Columbia University in New York City on May 21, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/student-wears-a-graduation-cap-with-a-verse-from-koran-news-photo/2215661839?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Jeenah Moon/Pool/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>5-star standard</h2>\n\n<p>The five-star standard includes practices that foster safe, guided interactions among people who hold different worldviews. </p>\n\n<p>In part, that means embedding worldview diversity in the curriculum.

Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jul/91-Percent-of-New-Renewable-Projects-Now-Cheaper-Than-Fossil-Fuels-Alternatives\">less expensive</a> today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. </p>\n\n<p>Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I <a href=\"https://keough.nd.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/jay-gulledge/\">study energy and climate solutions</a> and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation.</p>\n\n<h2>Falling clean energy prices</h2>\n\n<p>As their technologies have matured, solar power and wind power have become <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Jul/Costs-2025_Media-Briefing-Presentation.pdf\">cheaper than coal and natural gas</a> for utility-scale electricity generation in most areas, in large part because the fuel is free. The total global power generation from renewable sources <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Jul/IRENA_TEC_RPGC_in_2024_2025.pdf\">saved US$467 billion</a> in avoided fuel costs in 2024 alone.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of falling prices, <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Mar/Record-Breaking-Annual-Growth-in-Renewable-Power-Capacity\">over 90%</a> of all electricity-generating capacity added worldwide in 2024 came from clean energy sources, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of 2024, renewable energy accounted for <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Mar/IRENA_DAT_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2025.pdf\">46% of global installed electric power capacity</a>, with a record 585 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity added that year — <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/texas/\">about three times the total generating capacity in Texas</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Sv3Cl\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Sv3Cl/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Health benefits of leaving fossil fuels</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond affordability, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is healthier</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Burning coal, oil and natural gas releases tiny particles into the air along with toxic gases; these pollutants can make people sick. A recent study found air pollution from fossil fuels causes an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2023-077784\">5 million deaths worldwide</a> a year, based on 2019 data. </p>\n\n<p>For example, using natural gas to fuel stoves and other appliances <a href=\"https://www.psehealthyenergy.org/work/impacts-of-benzene-indoors-from-gas-stove-combustion/\">releases benzene</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/benzene.html\">known carcinogen</a>. The health risks of this exposure in some homes has been found to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c09289\">comparable to secondhand tobacco smoke</a>. Natural gas combustion has also been linked to childhood asthma, with an estimated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010075\">12.7% of U.S. childhood asthma cases</a> attributable to gas stoves, according to one study.</p>\n\n<p>Fossil fuels are also the leading sources of climate-warming greenhouse gases. When <a href=\"https://ugc.berkeley.edu/background-content/burning-of-fossil-fuels/\">they’re burned</a> to generate electricity or run factories, vehicles and appliances, they release carbon dioxide and other gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat near the Earth’s surface. That accumulation has been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">raising global temperatures and causing more</a> heat stress, respiratory illnesses and the spread of disease.</p>\n\n<p>Electrifying buildings, cars and appliances, and powering them with renewable energy, reduces these air pollutants while slowing climate change.</p>\n\n<h2>So what’s the problem?</h2>\n\n<p>In spite of the demonstrated economic and health benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, regulatory inertia, political gridlock and a lack of investment are holding back renewable energy deployment in much of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, for example, major energy projects take an average of 4.5 years to permit, and approval of new transmission lines <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2024/04/ACP-Pass-Permitting-Reform_Fact-Sheet.pdf\">can take a decade or longer</a>. A large <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-september-2024\">majority of planned new power projects in the U.S. use solar power</a>, and these delays are slowing them down.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4753?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">2024 Energy Permitting Reform Act</a> introduced by Sens.

For example, they can keep energy policies stable and use public funds or insurance to cover part of the lenders’ investment risk.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Workers check solar cells in a factory in China in 2025.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702640/original/file-20251115-56-3cvtxu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">China produces the vast majority of solar cells sold worldwide.

      "content": "<p>Not long ago, the idea of getting paid to share your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/broadcasting-your-breakfast-why-tiktokers-obsess-over-morning-routines\">morning routine</a> online would have sounded absurd. Yet today, influencers are big business: The global market is <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/\">expected to surpass US$32 billion</a> by the end of 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Rooted in celebrity culture but driven by digital platforms, the influencer economy represents a powerful force in both commerce and culture. I’m <a href=\"https://charleston.edu/management-marketing/faculty-staff/anderson-kelley.php\">an expert</a> on digital consumer research, and I see the rise of influencers as an important evolution in the relationship between companies, consumers and creators.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, brands leaned on traditional celebrities like musicians, athletes and actors to endorse their products. However, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2478/nimmir-2025-0001\">by the late 2000s</a>, social media platforms opened the door for everyday people to build audiences. Initially, influencers were viewed as a low-cost marketing tactic. Soon, however, they became a central part of marketing strategies. </p>\n\n<p>In the 2010s, influencer marketing matured into a global industry. Agencies and <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketplaces/\">digital marketplaces</a> emerged to professionalize influencer-brand matchmaking, and regulators like the <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-influencers-will-marketers-draw-line/\">Federal Trade Commission</a> started paying more attention to sponsored content. </p>\n\n<p>The rise of video and short-form content like TikTok and Reels in the mid-2010s and 2020s added authenticity and emotional immediacy. These dynamics deepened influencer-follower relations in ways that brands couldn’t easily replicate. Influencers are now recognized as not only <a href=\"https://jocis.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JOCIS_11_Miolo2_52-82.pdf\">content creators</a>, but also as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad003\">entrepreneurs</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cb.2474\">cultural producers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why people trust influencers</h2>\n\n<p>Social media influencers often foster what researchers call “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/taylor-swift-is-engaged-shes-been-getting-her-fans-ready-for-this-moment-for-20-years-264027\">parasocial relationships</a>” – one-sided bonds where followers feel as if they personally know the influencer. While the concept has roots in traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049\">celebrity culture</a>, influencers amplify it through consistent, seemingly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-65727-6_2\">authentic content</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This perceived intimacy helps explain why consumers often <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2024/08/14/how-influencers-can-drive-consumer-purchasing-behavior/\">trust influencers more than brands</a>. Though the parasocial relationship isn’t mutual, it feels real. That emotional closeness cultivates trust, a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/brands-want-us-to-trust-them-but-as-the-spf-debacle-shows-they-need-to-earn-it-259565\">scarce but powerful currency</a> in today’s economy.</p>\n\n<p>The goal for many influencers may be financial independence, but the path begins with <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/09/08/the-influencer-industry-the-quest-for-authenticity-on-social-media/\">social and cultural capital</a>, acquired through community connection, relatability and niche expertise. As an influencer’s following grows, so does their perceived legitimacy. Brands, in turn, recognize and tap into that legitimacy. </p>\n\n<p>Although risks exist, like <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-fitness-influencers-game-the-algorithms-to-pump-up-their-engagement-196017\">algorithmic incentives</a> and commercial partnerships that undercut authenticity, many influencers successfully navigate this tension to preserve their community’s trust. </p>\n\n<h2>The many ways creators add value</h2>\n\n<p>Like any economy, the influencer economy revolves around <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-024-01073-2\">value exchange</a>. Followers spend their valuable resources – time <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2022.2157864\">and attention</a> – in return for something meaningful. Researchers have identified several forms of value that influencers’ content can take:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Connection,</strong> or what researchers call “social value”: Influencers often build tight-knit communities around shared interests. Through live chats, comments and relatable storytelling, they offer a sense of belonging.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Fun,</strong> or “hedonic value”: Many influencers provide enjoyment using entertainment, humor and a touch of allure in their content. Think cat videos, TikTok dances and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02761467231163754\">random acts of kindness</a> that deliver joy and distraction from the day-to-day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge,</strong> or “epistemic value”: Creators offer informational or <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time100-creators-2025/7299150/mark-rober/\">educational content</a> to feed consumer curiosity. This can be through tutorials, product reviews or deep dives into niche topics.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Usefulness,</strong> or “utilitarian value”: From life hacks to product roundups, like “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/viral-amazon-must-haves-for-2025\">Amazon must-haves</a>,” influencers provide utilitarian or practical value to help simplify consumer decisions and solve everyday problems.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Money,</strong> or “financial value”: People love finding a bargain. <a href=\"https://www.influencer-hero.com/top-influencers/top-30-budget-beauty-influencers-in-the-us\">Discounts</a>, affiliate links and deal alerts offer direct economic benefit to followers. Some influencers even <a href=\"https://hireinfluence.com/blog/10-influencer-founded-brands-inspiring/\">launch their own products</a> or digital courses, delivering long-term value through entrepreneurial spinoffs. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These forms of value often overlap, reinforcing trust, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-024-01073-2\">can pay off financially</a> for influencers. In fact, consumers are significantly more likely to <a href=\"https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2024/11/is-user-generated-content-ugc-a-double-edged-sword-for-marketers\">trust user-generated content</a> like influencer posts over brand-generated advertising. </p>\n\n<h2>Lessons for brands</h2>\n\n<p>First, there’s evidence that smaller is often stronger. Marketing researchers categorize influencers based on how many followers they have, and nano- and microinfluencers – defined as those with fewer than 10,000 and 100,000 followers, respectively – <a href=\"https://later.com/blog/influencer-engagement-rate/\">often generate stronger engagement</a> than mega-influencers with more than 1 million. Influencers with smaller followings can interact with their communities more closely, making their endorsements feel more credible.</p>\n\n<p>This has driven brands to focus on <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics\">mid-tier and microinfluencers</a>, where return on investment is often stronger. As a result, influencer agencies, brokers, platforms and trade associations have sprung up to facilitate these partnerships. </p>\n\n<p>Second, brands should remember that influencers’ role in the market comes with new challenges. As the field continues to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\">become more professionalized</a>, it’s also become more complex. Like other entrepreneurs, influencers must keep up with shifting regulations – namely, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/ftc-influencer-guidelines/#:%7E:text=reading%20any%20further.-,FTC%20guidelines%20for%20influencers%20and%20content%20creators,make%20sure%20their%20followers%20know\">FTC sponsorship guidelines</a> – which can lead to hefty fines if violated. Many struggle to identify <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/influencers-have-trouble-figuring-out-their-tax-obligations-and-with-good-reason-250490\">how to best file their taxes</a> when they receive freebies they are expected to build content around. It can also be a challenge for influencers to keep up with <a href=\"https://stackinfluence.com/2025-social-media-algorithm-changes-engagement/\">continued algorithm tweaks</a> from the multiple social media platforms where they publish. </p>\n\n<p>Influencers manage more than content creation. Their role includes quickly responding to followers’ comments and managing communities, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231203682\">handling trolls</a>, all of which is stressful. Personal brand management adds another layer of pressure. As influencers gain more brand partnerships, they run the risk of being seen as “selling out.” Because parasocial trust depends on being viewed as authentic, aligning with the wrong brand or being too promotional can damage the very connection that built an influencer’s following. A single misstep can <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauljankowski/2021/06/22/7-tips-for-brands-when-their-influencers-get-canceled/\">trigger public backlash</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While growing a following can bring brand recognition and financial independence, some influencers even fear that they will <a href=\"https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/items/e59b7daa-0a51-453a-bbd7-c1125e5c1969\">lose their own identity</a>. Influencers can struggle with work-life balance, as this is not a nine-to-five job. It requires being “always on” and the constant <a href=\"https://www.gwi.com/blog/how-influencer-marketing-is-changing\">blurred lines</a>. Their lives become their livelihoods, with little separation between personal and professional identity. </p>\n\n<p>In short, when engaging with influencers, strategic brands will recognize that they operate within an intense, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/05/why-the-influencer-industry-needs-guardrails\">high-pressure environment</a>. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.americaninfluencercouncil.com\">American Influencer Council</a> offer support and advocacy, but industry-wide protections are lacking.</p>\n\n<p>Influencers have earned a central place in consumer culture not just by selling products, but by offering emotional proximity, cultural relevance and value. They’re not just marketers – they’re creators, community leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>As the creator economy continues to grow, trust will remain its cornerstone. However, the next chapter will require thoughtful navigation of issues like regulation, platform ethics and creator well-being. Understanding influencers means recognizing both their creative work and the evolving market that now depends on them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265718/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kelley Cours Anderson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Some also believe that because we are different from other creatures, we have complete control over our destiny and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/are-we-still-evolving-what-human-evolution-looks-like-today#google_vignette\">have no need to evolve</a>. Even though lots of people believe this, it’s not true. </p>\n\n<p>Like other living creatures, humans have been shaped by evolution. Over time, we have developed – and continue to develop – the traits that help us survive and flourish in the environments where we live. </p>\n\n<p>I’m an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=3oKUNQ0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">anthropologist</a>. I study how humans adapt to different environments. <a href=\"https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/mechanisms-the-processes-of-evolution/adaptation/\">Adaptation</a> is an important part of evolution. Adaptations are traits that give someone an advantage in their environment. People with those traits are more likely to survive and pass those traits on to their children. Over many generations, those traits become widespread in the population.</p>\n\n<h2>The role of culture</h2>\n\n<p>We humans have two hands that help us skillfully use tools and other objects. We are able to walk and run on two legs, which frees our hands for these skilled tasks. And we have large brains that let us <a href=\"https://askananthropologist.asu.edu/stories/when-did-our-brains-get-big\">reason, create ideas and live successfully with other people</a> in social groups. </p>\n\n<p>All of these traits have helped humans develop culture. Culture includes all of our ideas and beliefs and our abilities to plan and think about the present and the future. It also includes our ability to change our environment, for example by making tools and growing food. </p>\n\n<p>Although we humans have changed our environment in many ways during the past few thousand years, we are still changed by evolution. We have not stopped evolving, but we are evolving right now in different ways than our ancient ancestors. Our environments are <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/science/are-humans-still-evolving/\">often changed by our culture</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We usually think of an environment as the weather, plants and animals in a place. But environments include the foods we eat and the infectious diseases we are exposed to. </p>\n\n<p>A very important part of the environment is the climate and what kinds of conditions we can live in. Our culture helps us change our exposure to the climate. For example, we build houses and put furnaces and air conditioners in them.

In contrast, those of us with a lot of skin pigment, called melanin, have some <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22615-melanin\">protection against damaging ultraviolet rays</a> from sunshine.</p>\n\n<p>People in the tropics with dark skin are <a href=\"https://online.kidsdiscover.com/unit/skin/topic/the-colors-of-skin\">more likely to thrive</a> under frequent bright sunlight. Yet, when ancient humans moved to cloudy, cooler places, the dark skin was not needed. Dark skin in cloudy places blocked the production of vitamin D in the skin, which is necessary for normal bone growth in children and adults. </p>\n\n<p>The amount of melanin pigment in our skin is <a href=\"https://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/jablonski-lab/evolution-of-human-skin-and-skin-pigmentation/\">controlled by our genes</a>. So in this way, human evolution is driven by the environment – sunny or cloudy – in different parts of the world.</p>\n\n<h2>The food that we eat</h2>\n\n<p>Ten thousand years ago, our human ancestors began to tame or <a href=\"https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/domesticated-animal/272875\">domesticate animals</a> such as cattle and goats to eat their meat. Then about 2,000 years later, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20682-3\">learned how to milk cows and goats</a> for this rich food. Unfortunately, like most other mammals at that time, human adults back then could not digest milk without feeling ill. Yet a few people were able to digest milk because they had genes that let them do so. </p>\n\n<p>Milk was such an important source of food in these societies that the people who could digest milk were <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-humans-ability-to-digest-milk-evolved-from-famine-and-disease/\">better able to survive</a> and have many children. So the genes that allowed them to digest milk increased in the population until nearly everyone could drink milk as adults. </p>\n\n<p>This process, which occurred and spread thousands of years ago, is an example of what is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2025.08.003\">cultural and biological co-evolution</a>. It was the cultural practice of milking animals that <a href=\"https://www.snexplores.org/article/got-milk-how\">led to these genetic or biological changes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other people, such as the Inuit in Greenland, have genes that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/17/441169188/the-secret-to-the-inuit-high-fat-diet-may-be-good-genes\">enable them to digest fats</a> without suffering from heart diseases. The Turkana people herd livestock in Kenya in a very dry part of Africa. They have a gene that allows them to go for long periods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2467\">without drinking much water</a>. This practice would cause kidney damage in other people because the kidney regulates water in your body. </p>\n\n<p>These examples show how the remarkable diversity of foods that people eat around the world can affect evolution.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"gray scale microscope image of numerous blobs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">These bacteria caused a devastating pandemic nearly 700 years ago that led humans to evolve resistance to them.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/scanning-electron-micrograph-depicting-a-mass-of-yersinia-news-photo/1289424977\">Image Point FR/NIH/NIAID/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Diseases that threaten us</h2>\n\n<p>Like all living creatures, humans have been exposed to many infectious diseases. During the 14th century a deadly disease called the <a href=\"https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/plague/353636\">bubonic plague</a> struck and spread rapidly throughout Europe and Asia. It <a href=\"https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/the-plague-that-shook-medieval-europe\">killed about one-third of the population</a> in Europe. Many of those who survived had a specific gene that gave them resistance against the disease. Those people and their descendants were <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-black-death-shaped-human-evolution\">better able to survive</a> epidemics that followed for several centuries. </p>\n\n<p>Some diseases have struck quite recently. COVID-19, for instance, swept the globe in 2020. Vaccinations saved many lives. Some people have a <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2023/06/425696/gene-mutation-may-explain-why-some-dont-get-sick-covid-19\">natural resistance to the virus</a> based on their genes. It may be that evolution increases this resistance in the population and helps humans fight future virus epidemics. </p>\n\n<p>As human beings, we are exposed to a variety of changing environments. And so evolution in many human populations continues across generations, including right now.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you’d like an expert to answer?

It has claimed countless lives, deepened social divisions and even led to the collapse of democratic systems. </p>\n\n<p>In recent history, political violence and its deadly consequences were seen in <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen\">Italy after World War I</a> when thousands of fascist supporters marched on Rome, the capital, threatening to overthrow the government unless Benito Mussolini was appointed prime minister. That kind of violence and its effects were also seen in <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250210869/thedeathofdemocracy/\">1930s Germany</a>, where Adolf Hitler suppressed opposition and suspended civil liberties amid widespread unrest and factional violence. </p>\n\n<p>Similar patterns occurred elsewhere in the decades that followed. Fascist movements used political violence and intimidation to seize or consolidate power, as seen in <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/spanish-civil-war\">Spain under Francisco Franco</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309021027_The_Political_and_Ideological_Origins_of_the_Estado_Novo_in_Portugal\">Portugal under António de Oliveira Salazar</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/iron-guard/\">Romania under the Iron Guard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, many scholars, journalists, commentators and elected officials across the political spectrum have <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-024-09934-w\">voiced alarm</a> over escalating acts of violence in the United States, drawing parallels to Europe’s authoritarian past. Reports of <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024\">politically motivated violence are distressingly common</a> – ranging from mass shootings, car-ramming attacks and assaults at demonstrations to assassination attempts, kidnappings and threats targeting mayors, governors, political activists and members of Congress. </p>\n\n<p>For example, threats of violence against members of Congress increased by more than 1,400%, from 902 in 2016 to an estimated 14,000 by the end of 2025, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-lawmakers-personal-security-threats-kirk-safety-d1eb88b5e80710aff20ba7a098bf64f8\">according to U.S. Capitol Police reports</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Political violence is certainly not new in American society, but current patterns differ in key ways. We found that, today, white nationalism is a key driver of support for political violence – a sign that white nationalism poses substantial danger to U.S. political stability. </p>\n\n<p>In the 1970s, violence was political theater, aimed at drawing government and public attention to specific policies. Today, it’s personal and deadly, driven by a desire to annihilate.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A page from a letter signed in red pen, 'Weather Underground,' claiming to have perpetrated a bombing of the U.S. Capitol building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Page 5 and envelope of a letter received by The Associated Press in Washington D.C., on March 2, 1971, signed by ‘Weather Underground,’ which claims responsibility for the March 1 bombing of the U.S. Capitol building.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/WeatherUndergroundLetter/e3ce000e08f24e0c93740593ed92d61f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Changing targets</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-politics-violence/\">In the 1970s</a>, radical left-wing groups often targeted government property to send political messages. </p>\n\n<p>Attacks included the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/weather-underground-bombings\">anti–Vietnam War bombings carried out by the Weather Underground</a>, as well as actions by groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/guerrilla-rise-and-fall-symbionese-liberation-army/\">Symbionese Liberation Army</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4135/9781412980173.n407\">United Freedom Front</a>. They struck government and corporate targets to protest imperialism, racism and economic inequality. These attacks were generally intended as statements rather than mass-casualty events, with perpetrators often issuing warnings beforehand to <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/terrorism-perspectives-from-the-social-sciences-9780197599877?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">minimize harm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, however, much of the violence is aimed directly at individuals, often with the intent to harm or kill <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en\">political opponents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These include incidents such as the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/14/532921612/what-we-know-about-the-suspect-in-gop-baseball-practice-shooting\">2017 shooting</a> targeting Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5171029/man-who-attacked-nancy-pelosis-husband-gets-life-in-prison\">2022 hammer attack</a> on Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/28/g-s1-74962/minnesota-melissa-hortman-funeral-house-speaker\">the 2025 killing of Democrat Melissa Hortman, the former speaker of the Minnesota House</a>, and her husband in what authorities described as a politically motivated assassination. </p>\n\n<p>This resurgence of political violence has prompted intense academic and journalistic scrutiny. Numerous public opinion surveys have sought to gauge Americans’ approval of, or concern about, using violence against the government or political adversaries. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prri.org/research/threats-to-american-democracy-ahead-of-an-unprecedented-presidential-election/\">Initial estimates</a> suggested nearly 1 in 4 Americans support political violence. But later <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116870119\">studies identified flaws</a> in the questions used to measure support for violence. Simply asking about violence in general or the use of force leaves too much room for interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>Using more sophisticated questioning techniques results in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/far-fewer-americans-support-political-violence-than-recent-polls-suggest-266113\">lower estimates</a> of public support for political violence.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what drives individuals to endorse political violence is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent it. As public opinion researchers who have studied <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azae025\">Americans’ attitudes</a> toward ideological extremism, political polarization and counterterrorism policy, we sought to advance our understanding of the factors underlying public support for political violence in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>We aimed to do this in two ways: by using more specific questioning techniques and by identifying the factors associated with increased support for violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Who justifies political violence?</h2>\n\n<p>Our study focused specifically on <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/722762\">white nationalism</a> – a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197500484.001.0001\">growing movement</a> in the U.S. –  as a driver of support for violence. </p>\n\n<p>We asked <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2025.2504966\">a national sample of 1,300 Americans</a> how justified or unjustified it would be “to take violent action against the U.S. government” in response to a range of government actions. This approach captures both approval of the use of violence and its political motivation. </p>\n\n<p>We included nonpartisan government actions such as “the government violated or took away citizens’ rights and freedoms” and “the government violated the U.S. Constitution” along with hypothetical actions reflecting right or left-wing political causes. For example, a right-wing action would be to ban all abortions while a left-wing action would be to legalize all abortions.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"u4mJ2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u4mJ2/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Analyses revealed substantial support for violence against the government in response to the nonpartisan government actions. Half of the respondents indicated that violence would be justified if the government violated citizens’ rights, and 55% supported the use of violence as a response if the U.S. government committed unlawful violence against citizens. Nearly 40% said that violence would be justified if the government censored the news.</p>\n\n<p>When we examined the factors behind these attitudes, a belief in white nationalism stood out above all others. But what, precisely, is white nationalism? It is more than simply identifying as white. Indeed, white nationalism is a sentiment found among some <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306352/whiteshift-by-kaufmann-eric/9780141986630\">nonwhite Americans</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>White nationalists are concerned about the increasing diversity of the American population and want to ensure that white citizens maintain a predominant influence in the country. To them, white citizens’ social, cultural and political values are superior to those of nonwhite citizens and immigrants. The perceived need to protect and propagate these values serves as a call to action. </p>\n\n<p>This ideology has motivated several recent acts of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/great-replacement-theory-inspired-terror-attacks-recent-years-1706953\">mass violence</a>, from synagogue shootings to racially targeted attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Our data revealed that a belief in white nationalism predicted support for political violence as well. In response to both nonpartisan government actions and those that would benefit left-wing causes, the stronger a person’s white nationalist sentiment, the more strongly that individual believed that violence would be justified. </p>\n\n<p>Out of all the variables in our statistical models, including political views and demographic characteristics, white nationalism was the strongest predictor of support for violence in these circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>It did not, however, significantly influence support for violence when the government actions would benefit right-wing causes.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"jqFx3\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jqFx3/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Growing threat to US democracy</h2>\n\n<p>Most people who voice support for political violence will never commit violent acts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295747\">themselves</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet such attitudes foster an atmosphere of tolerance, signaling that violence is acceptable and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-criminol-030521-102553\">enabling its continuation</a>.

They wanted to show Americans uncomfortable truths about the practice of slavery – a strategy that is happening again as activists and citizens fight modern-day attempts at historical whitewashing.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/people/profile.html?p=glanosga\">media scholar who has studied</a> the history of abolitionist journalism, I hear echoes of that two-century-old narrative battle in President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/\">effort to purge public memorials</a> and markers honoring the suffering and heroism of the enslaved as well as those who championed their freedom. </p>\n\n<h2>Celebration vs. reality</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"the image shows a Black man sitting and facing away from the camera, his back deeply scarred by whipping\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=957&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=957&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=957&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1202&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1202&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696544/original/file-20251015-66-c14mbs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1202&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘The Scourged Back,’ by McPherson &amp; Oliver, is an 1863 image that depicts the scarred back of a formerly enslaved man.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/216280-scourged-back\">Courtesy National Gallery of Art, Washington</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Among the materials <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-orders-removal-famous-014116035.html\">reportedly flagged for removal</a> from history museums, national parks and other government facilities is a disturbing but powerful photograph known as “<a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/learn/classroom-resource/gordon-lifedates-unknown\">The Scourged Back</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The 1863 image depicts a formerly enslaved man, his back horrifically scarred by whipping. It’s certainly hard to look at, yet to look away or try to forget it means to ignore what it has to say about the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-list-smithsonian-exhibits-2117594\">complicated and often brutal history of the nation</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In Trump’s view, these memorials are “revisionist” and “driven by ideology rather than truth.” In an executive order named <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/\">Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</a>, Trump said public materials should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the president appears to want a history that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history\">celebrates American achievement</a> rather than being forced to look at “The Scourged Back” and other historical realities that document aspects of the American story that don’t warrant celebration. </p>\n\n<h2>Combating ignorance of slavery’s horrors</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking back to the decades leading up to the Civil War, facts were the weapon abolitionists wielded in their fight against the distortions of pro-slavery forces. It was an uphill battle in the face of indifference by many in the North. After a visit to Massachusetts in 1830, abolitionist writer William Lloyd Garrison <a href=\"https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook_print.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=348\">blamed such attitudes</a> on “exceeding ignorance of the horrors of slavery.” </p>\n\n<p>It is not surprising that in the early 19th century many Americans would have had limited knowledge of slavery. Travel was arduous, time-consuming and expensive, and  most Northerners had little firsthand exposure to slave societies. Abolitionists argued that those who did visit the South were often shielded from the harsher realities of slavery. This extended to the media ecosystem, which lacked any real national news organizations. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Southern plantation owners carried out a robust propaganda effort to extol the beneficence of their economic system. In <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1641\">letters</a>, <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1641\">pamphlets</a> and books, they argued that slavery was beneficial to all and that the enslaved were happy and well-treated. They also attacked their opponents as evil and dishonest.</p>\n\n<p>As abolitionist Lydia Maria Child <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbaapc.05000/?st=gallery\">wrote in 1838</a>: “The apologists of Southern slavery are accustomed to brand every picture of slavery and its fruits as exaggeration or calumny.” </p>\n\n<h2>Don’t look away</h2>\n\n<p>Thus, the challenge for abolitionists was to show slavery as it really was – and to compel people to look. An emphasis on hard evidence took firm hold in the wave of abolitionism in the 1830s.</p>\n\n<p>Activists didn’t yet have photography, so they relied on accounts from eyewitnesses and formerly enslaved people, official reports and even some plantation owners’ own words in <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2019/10/runaway-fugitive-slave-ads-in-newspapers/\">Southern newspaper advertisements seeking the return of runaways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Until the pictures of the slave’s sufferings were drawn up and held up to public gaze, no Northerner had any idea of the cruelty of the system,” abolitionist Angelina Grimké wrote in her famous “<a href=\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/appeal-to-christian-women-of-the-south-2/\">Appeal to the Christian Women of the South</a>” in 1836.</p>\n\n<p>“It never entered their minds that such abominations could exist in Christian, Republican America; they never suspected that many of the gentlemen and ladies who came from the South to spend the summer months in travelling among them, were petty tyrants at home,” Grimké wrote.</p>\n\n<p>In pamphlets and newspapers, Grimké and others laid down a documentary record of the abuses of slavery, naming names and emphasizing legal evidence of their claims. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08821127.2022.2133024\">In my research</a>, I have argued that while abolitionists didn’t invent the journalistic exposé, they did develop the first fully articulated methodology for confronting abuses of power through carefully documented facts – laying the groundwork for later generations of investigative reporters and fact-checkers.</p>\n\n<p>Most critically, what they did is point a finger at injustice and demand that America not look away. In its first issue, in 1835, the newspaper Human Rights emphasized “the importance of first settling what slavery really is.” Inside, it included a series of advertisements documenting slave sales and rewards for runaways reprinted from Southern newspapers. </p>\n\n<p>The headline: “ <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3990/human_rights_v1n1_page_3_highlight.heic.pdf?1763325442\">LOOK AT THIS!!</a>”</p>\n\n<h2>Tried and acquitted</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a woman in a bonnet poses for a photograph\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Angelina Grimké was an abolitionist writer.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a03341/\">Library of Congress</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One of the most remarkable efforts in this abolitionist campaign was a 233-page pamphlet called “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DKC0106/page/n4/mode/1up\">American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses</a>.” Published in 1839 by Theodore Dwight Weld along with his wife, Angelina Grimké, and her sister, it was an exhaustively documented exposé of floggings, torture, killings, overwork and undernourishment. </p>\n\n<p>One example involved a wealthy tobacconist who whipped a 15-year-old girl to death: “While he was whipping her, his wife heated a smoothing iron, put it on her body in various places, and burned her severely. The verdict of the coroner’s inquest was, ‘Died of excessive whipping.’ He was tried in Richmond and acquitted.”</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult reading, to be sure, and certainly the kind of material that might foster “a national sense of shame,” as Trump’s executive order claims. But getting rid of the evils of slavery meant first acknowledging them. And the second part – critical to avoiding the mistakes of the past – is remembering them.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Consciences shocked’</h2>\n\n<p>So how effective was this abolitionist campaign to lay bare the terrible facts about slavery? </p>\n\n<p>At least some readers of “<a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3987/Pages_from_Weld_Slavery_as_It_Is.pdf?1762977572\">American Slavery As It Is</a>” had their consciences shocked. <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3988/Emancipator_published_as_The_Emancipator___June_13_1839_%281%29.pdf?1762977804\">One New Hampshire newspaper reacted this way</a>: “We thought we knew something of the horrid character of slavery before, but upon looking over the pages of this book, we find that we had no adequate idea of the number and enormity of the cruelties which are constantly being perpetrated under this system of all abominations.” </p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.keytouncletomsca00stow/?sp=25&amp;r=0.151,0.065,1.395,0.729,0\">one famous reader was Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, who drew on the book as inspiration for “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” published more than a decade later. </p>\n\n<p>The 1830s reflected the height of the abolitionist movement in books, pamphlets and newspapers. While the activism continued in the 1840s and 1850s, ultimately it took secession and civil war to finally end slavery. But, of course, it didn’t take long for the country to fall into a prolonged period of formal and informal segregation in both the North and the South, many vestiges of which remain.</p>\n\n<p>That reality of a history that doesn’t proceed along a straight path to justice underscores the importance of preserving, remembering and teaching difficult parts of the past such as “The Scourged Back.”</p>\n\n<p>On the title page of “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DKC0106/page/n4/mode/1up\">American Slavery As It Is</a>,” Weld and the Grimkés printed a quote from the biblical book of Ezekiel: “Behold the wicked abominations that they do.” It was a command to the nation to look without flinching at what it was, and it is as pertinent today as it was then.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was corrected to include the correct image of Angelina Grimké.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266424/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gerry Lanosga does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, there is reliable evidence they have done just the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 20 years, stand your ground has spread to 38 states. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in September 2025, an appellate court <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/10/appeals-court-strikes-down-floridas-open-carry-law/86075928007/\">struck down Florida’s long-standing ban</a> on the open carry of firearms.</p>\n\n<p>Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, quickly announced that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-open-carry-law-what-to-know-gun-rights-control/\">open carry is now “the law of the state</a>,” directing law enforcement not to arrest people who display handguns in public.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ron-desantis-quietly-signs-permitless-concealed-carry-law-rcna77934\">Under the state’s permitless carry law</a>, enacted in 2023, adults without a criminal record also <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/constitutional-carry-donald-trump-guns-without-permits\">don’t need a permit or any training</a> to carry firearms publicly.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, this combination of stand your ground, open carry and permitless carry is likely to make the Sunshine State far less safe.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at the evidence.</p>\n\n<h2>What ‘stand your ground’ means</h2>\n\n<p>Under traditional self-defense law, a person had a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8GwNpFQgflw\">duty to retreat</a> – to try to avoid a violent confrontation if they could safely do so – before resorting to deadly force.</p>\n\n<p>The main exception to the duty to retreat was known as the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/castle_doctrine\">castle doctrine</a>, whereby people could defend themselves, with force if necessary, if they were attacked in their own homes.</p>\n\n<p>Stand your ground laws effectively expand the boundaries of the castle doctrine to the wider world, removing the duty to retreat and allowing people to use lethal force anywhere they have a legal right to be, as long as they believe it’s necessary to prevent death or serious harm.</p>\n\n<p>On paper, the expansion of the right to self-defense may sound reasonable. But in practice, stand your ground laws have <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2711425\">blurred the line between self-defense and aggression</a> by <a href=\"https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2022/01/the-dangerous-expansion-of-stand-your-ground-laws-and-its-racial-implications\">expanding legal immunity</a> for some who claim self-defense and shifting the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/04/bill-to-shift-stand-your-ground-burden-of-proof-to-prosecutors-clears-house-floor-111051\">burden of proof to prosecutors</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While supporters of these laws claim they mitigate crime and make people safer, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.0077\">evidence shows the opposite</a>. The nonpartisan RAND Corp. discovered that states adopting stand your ground laws experienced <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground.html\">significant increases in homicide</a>, typically between 8% and 11% higher than before the laws took effect.</p>\n\n<p>A study of violent crime in Florida revealed <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6811\">a 31.6% increase in firearm homicides</a> following the 2005 passage of the stand your ground law. There is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306101\">no credible evidence</a> that these laws deter crime. </p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, evidence shows that stand your ground laws <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground.html\">lower the legal, moral and psychological costs</a> of <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/22/stand-your-ground-laws-linked-to-higher-homicide-rates-new-report-finds/#:%7E:text=People%20are%20more%20likely%20to,United%20States?\">pulling the trigger</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Stand your ground and race</h2>\n\n<p>While the language of stand your ground laws is race-neutral, their enforcement is not. Data from the <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/race-justifiable-homicide-and-stand-your-ground-laws\">Urban Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.usccr.gov/reports/2020/examining-race-effects-stand-your-ground-laws-and-related-issues\">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a> show that in states with stand your ground laws, homicides are far more likely to be deemed “justified” when the shooter is white and the victim is Black.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve found that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/stand-your-ground-laws-empower-armed-citizens-to-defend-property-with-violence-a-simple-mistake-can-get-you-shot-or-killed-204012\">these laws have redefined</a> not only when force is justified but who is justified in using force.</p>\n\n<p>In my assessment, these laws don’t create racial bias. Rather, they magnify the biases already present in our criminal legal system. They give broader discretion to a legal system in which law enforcement officers, judges, prosecutors and juries often hold unacknowledged biases that associate <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000092\">Black men with criminality</a>, while perceiving white people who say they were defending themselves as credible.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A sign for a rally after the Trayvon Martin shooting in Sanford, Florida.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin was unarmed when George Zimmerman shot and killed him on March 20, 2012, in Sanford, Fla.

And when the law tells you that you don’t have to back down, that perception can turn lethal in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Florida has become a model for what <a href=\"https://www.nrablog.com/articles/2016/5/the-truth-is-we-are-freedoms-safest-place\">gun rights advocates</a> call “freedom” but what <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306101\">public health experts</a> see as a recipe for more shootings and more death.</p>\n\n<h2>National implications: ‘Reciprocity’ and expansion</h2>\n\n<p>Two decades later, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-which-states-have-stand-your-ground-laws-10904209\">stand your ground laws have spread</a>, in various forms, to 38 states. While 30 states have legislatively enacted stand your ground statutes like Florida’s, eight others implement stand your ground <a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/stand-your-ground-laws-50-state-survey/#:%7E:text=California%20has%20a%20judicial%20stand,instructions%20also%20provide%20this%20rule\">through case law and jury instructions</a> that effectively remove the duty to retreat.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"epncB\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/epncB/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>On top of this, 29 states have enacted laws allowing permitless carry, and 47 <a href=\"https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/blog/what-is-open-carry-and-which-states-allow-it/\">technically allow open carry</a>, though restrictions vary across the states. </p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to take this deregulatory approach nationwide. While on the campaign trail, he <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/maga-meter-tracking-donald-trumps-2024-promises/promise/1659/expand-concealed-carry-rights/article/3197/\">promised to sign a “concealed-carry reciprocity” law</a>, which would require all states to allow people from states with permissive laws to exercise those rights in all 50. “Your Second Amendment does not end at the state line,” he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-violence-prevention-groups-brace-trump-promise-concealed/story?id=115749093\">announced in a 2023 video</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If that vision becomes reality, it would mean the most permissive state laws will set the standard for the entire country. National reciprocity would allow Floridians, and other gun owners from permitless carry states, to carry their firearms – and potentially claim stand your ground immunity – in any other state, including those with stricter rules and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/us/everytown-weak-gun-laws-high-gun-deaths-study\">lower rates of firearm death and injury</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This prospect raises deep questions about states’ rights, safety and justice. Research shows that stand your ground laws increase homicide and exacerbate racial disparities. National reciprocity would export those effects nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the convergence of stand your ground, open carry and national reciprocity marks the culmination of a 20-year experiment in armed citizenship. The results are clear: more people armed, more shootings and more deaths “justified.”</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether the rest of the nation will follow Florida’s lead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267496/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Caroline Light is affiliated with GVPedia and collaborates with Giffords. </span></em></p>",
