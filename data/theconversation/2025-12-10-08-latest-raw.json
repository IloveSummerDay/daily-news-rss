DNA is organized into regions called genes, each of which codes for proteins that carry out different functions like repairing tissues.</p>\n\n<p>While your DNA generally stays the same throughout your life, it can sometimes collect small chemical changes called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/epigenetics\">epigenetic modifications</a>. These changes act like dimmer switches, turning genes up or down without changing the underlying code. In general, dialing up the activity of a gene increases production of the protein it codes for, while dialing down the gene decreases production of that protein.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aAhcNjmvhc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Epigenetic changes play a significant role in how your body functions and develops.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One common type of epigenetic modification is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2022.03.010\">DNA methylation</a>. DNA methylation is not fixed but can instead change in response to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-you-eat-could-alter-your-unborn-children-and-grandchildrens-genes-and-health-outcomes-221091\">what you eat</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00217-0\">how you move your body</a> or even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09299-y\">how stressed you are</a>. We wondered if these epigenetic changes might also change in response to brain injury in children.</p>\n\n<h2>Epigenetic changes in traumatic brain injury</h2>\n\n<p>To explore this idea, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00460\">enrolled nearly 300 children</a> at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh in our study. Of these children, 189 had a traumatic brain injury serious enough to require at least one night in the hospital, while the others had broken bones but no head injury. </p>\n\n<p>We collected blood samples while they were in the hospital, and again at six and 12 months after their injury. We then measured DNA methylation in a gene called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105078\">brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<em>BDNF</em>)</a>, which plays a role in how the brain develops and repairs. </p>\n\n<p>Within approximately 30 hours of injury, children with traumatic brain injury had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">lower levels DNA methylation</a> than children without brain injury. Interestingly, these differences were not connected to how severe the child’s injury appeared based on tests that health care teams use in the clinic, such as brain scans or evaluations of consciousness. This suggests that two children who look very similar to the eye may be responding to their injury differently at the cellular and epigenetic level.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings also suggest that DNA methylation could help researchers understand something completely new about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">brain’s response to injury</a> that existing clinical tools cannot detect. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Doctor looking at panel of brain scans.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707191/original/file-20251208-56-crdet4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Brain scans don’t show what’s happening at the cellular and genetic level.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-female-doctor-examine-mri-picture-royalty-free-image/1224190214\">mady70/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Improving recovery after traumatic brain injury</h2>\n\n<p>When a child comes to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury, health care teams can assess the injury based on what it looks like and how the child is currently handling symptoms. But they cannot necessarily determine how a child’s body is responding to their injury, or what other factors put them at risk for poor recovery. That gap makes it difficult to predict which children may later experience <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27080734/\">problems with thinking, attention or behavior</a>. Because the brains of children are still developing, early injuries can disrupt development and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.51195\">lead to long-term cognitive or behavioral issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings indicate that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08977151251400737\">epigenetic signals like DNA methylation</a> might help clinicians and researchers develop more effective treatment strategies. While it’s still unclear whether these epigenetic changes influence children’s cognitive function after injury, further research could enable DNA methylation to offer a more precise guide to rehabilitation. In fact, our team is currently examining how <a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/1djDWFDVoEiQmU-lrOwRNw/project-details/11087693\">DNA methylation patterns across all genes</a> affect long-term outcomes in children with traumatic brain injury.</p>\n\n<p>Pairing what clinicians can observe at the bedside with information at the cellular and epigenetic level can bring medicine one step closer to individualized care plans matching children with treatments that can most effectively help them heal.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271453/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lacey W.

Though politicians may tout new opportunities to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/climate/trump-offshore-drilling-leases.html\">drill offshore</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-finalizes-plan-to-open-pristine-alaska-wildlife-refuge-to-drilling\">Arctic Alaska</a>, the commercial payoff is not clear and even unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>Having worked in and <a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/expert/harold-skip-york\">studied the energy industry for decades</a>, I’ve seen a number of discoveries that companies struggled to moved forward with because either the discovery was not large enough to be commercially profitable or the geology was too difficult to make development plausible. Market conditions are the prime drivers of U.S. energy investment – not moves by politicians seeking to seem supportive of the industry.</p>\n\n<h2>Market fundamentals trump policy announcements</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=RWTC&amp;f=W\">general decline in oil prices</a> from 2022 through late 2025 has reduced the attractiveness of many drilling investments. </p>\n\n<p>And opening the East and West coasts to drilling may sound significant, but these regions have <a href=\"https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/resource-evaluation/2021-assessment-undiscovered-oil-and-gas-resources-nations-outer\">unconfirmed reserves</a>. That means a lot of subsurface work, such as seismic surveys, stratigraphic mapping and reservoir characterization – potentially taking years – would need to be done before any drilling would begin.</p>\n\n<p>Offshore drilling also faces enormous opposition. </p>\n\n<p>On the West Coast, California Gov. <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/11/20/governor-newsom-issues-statement-on-trumps-idiotic-offshore-oil-drilling-proposal\">Gavin Newsom</a> and California Attorney General <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/california-not-your-playground-attorney-general-bonta-condemns-trump\">Rob Bonta</a> have made forceful statements against any new California offshore oil drilling. They have said any effort is economically unnecessary, environmentally reckless and “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/climate/offshore-drilling-california-trump-newsom.html\">dead on arrival</a>” politically in the state.</p>\n\n<p>California local governments, environmental groups, business alliances and coastal communities also oppose drilling and have <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/california-offshore-drilling-newsom-trump/3807191/\">vowed to use legal and political tools</a> to block them.</p>\n\n<p>There is opposition on the East Coast, too. More than <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/press-release/offshore-drilling-plan-leaves-out-atlantic-proposes-leases-in-gulf/\">250 East Coast local governments</a> have passed resolutions against drilling.</p>\n\n<p>Governors on both sides of the aisle, including Democrat <a href=\"https://governor.nc.gov/june-16-2025-letter-governor-stein-and-governor-mcmaster-re-maintaining-trump-moratorium-offshore\">Josh Stein of North Carolina</a> and Republicans <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/kemp-discusses-environment-deal-legacy/article_fc0854fc-bfd5-5bc4-aa03-10830ba9d9e9.html\">Brian Kemp of Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/south-carolina-gov-henry-mcmaster-wants-offshore-no-drill-oil/article_b4162f12-f614-11e7-b5bc-1b205b230114.html\">Henry McMaster of South Carolina</a>, have spoken out against drilling off their coasts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arctic drilling is even harder</h2>\n\n<p>Drilling for oil and gas in the <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/congress-axes-biden-anwr-drilling-limits/\">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> and the Beaufort Sea off Prudhoe Bay in Alaska would be a massive undertaking. These projects require years of development and are subject to future reversals in federal policy – just as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5584883/trump-alaska-wildlife-refuge-oil-gas-drilling\">Trump has lifted long-standing drilling bans</a> in those areas, at least for now.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Alaska is one of the <a href=\"https://digital.akbizmag.com/issue/june-2021/is-alaska-oil-measuring-up/\">most expensive</a> and technically challenging places to drill. Specialized equipment, infrastructure for frozen landscapes, and risk mitigation for <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=AK\">extreme weather</a> drive costs far above other regions. These projects also face logistical challenges, such as pipelines running hundreds of miles through remote, icy terrain.</p>\n\n<p>Natural gas from Alaska would likely be <a href=\"https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2025/12/02/dunleavy-claims-legally-binding-south-korea-pipeline-deal-is-near-lead-lng-developer-disagrees/\">sold to Asian buyers</a>, who increasingly have <a href=\"https://www.ice.com/insights/energy/the-globalization-of-natural-gas-gains-momentum\">alternative sources of supply</a> from Australia, Canada, Qatar and even the U.S. Gulf Coast. As production rises in those places, the entrance of Alaskan natural gas into the market raises the risk for <a href=\"https://www.oilandgasadvancement.com/news/global-lng-supply-excess-could-shrink-the-prices-by-2026/\">global oversupply</a>, which could depress prices and reduce profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Despite political support from the Trump administration, the oil and gas companies would need financing to pay for the drilling. And those loans won’t come if the oil companies don’t have agreements with buyers for the petroleum products that are produced. <a href=\"https://alaskapublic.org/news/2024-05-23/shell-abandons-north-slope-oil-leases-raising-questions-about-the-industrys-future-in-alaska\">Major oil companies</a> have withdrawn from Alaska and signaled skepticism about attractive long-term returns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A close-up of a person holding a pen and signing a piece of white paper.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706246/original/file-20251203-56-1uwygh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders seeking to boost the oil and gas industry.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-signs-one-of-five-executive-orders-news-photo/632590450\">Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Trump has helped some</h2>\n\n<p>In the first 10 months of the second Trump administration, the president has signed at least 13 <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025\">executive orders pertaining to the energy industry</a>. Most of them focus on streamlining U.S. energy regulation and removing barriers to the development and procurement of domestic energy resources. However, the broad nature of some of these orders may fall short of establishing the stable regulatory environment necessary for the development of capital-intensive energy projects with long time horizons.</p>\n\n<p>Those efforts have reversed the Biden administration’s go-slow approach to oil drilling, reducing – though not completely eliminating – the backlog of requests for <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/operations-and-production/permitting/applications-permits-drill\">onshore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.data.bsee.gov/Well/APD/Default.aspx\">offshore</a> drilling permits that accumulated during Biden’s presidency.</p>\n\n<p>Delays in permit approvals increase project costs, risk and uncertainty. Delays can increase the chances that a project ultimately is downsized – as happened with <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-substantially-reduces-scope-willow-project\">ConocoPhillips’ Willow project in Alaska</a> – or canceled altogether. Longer timelines increase financing and carrying costs, because capital is tied up without generating revenue and developers must pay interest on the debt while waiting for approvals. Delays also lead to higher project costs, eroding project economics and sometimes preventing the project from turning a profit.</p>\n\n<h2>Investment follows economics, not politics</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike in some countries, such as with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Norway’s Equinor or China’s CHN Energy, the U.S. does not have a <a href=\"https://www.nationaloilcompanydata.org/indicator\">national oil or gas company</a>. All of the major energy producers in the U.S. are privately owned and answer to shareholders, not the government. </p>\n\n<p>Executive orders or political slogans may set a tone or direction, but they cannot override the fundamental requirement for profitability. Investments can’t be mandated by presidential decree: Projects must make economic sense. Without that, whether due to low prices, high costs, uncertain demand or changing regulations, companies will not proceed.</p>\n\n<p>Even if federal policies open new areas for drilling or relieve some regulatory restrictions, companies will invest only if they see a clear path to profit over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>With most energy investments costing large amounts of money over many years, the industry likely wants a sense of policy stability from the Trump administration. That could include lowering barriers to profitable investments by <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bipartisan-house-permitting-reform-bill/760477/\">accelerating the approval process for supporting infrastructure</a>, such as transmission power lines, pipelines, storage capacity and other logistics, rather than relying on sweeping announcements that lack market traction.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270518/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Skip York does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/202/\">Supreme Court ruled</a> that students could not be discriminated against based on their immigration status. </p>\n\n<p>This ruling ensured that immigrant students could not be denied entrance to public K-12 schools. </p>\n\n<p>The caveat is that the ruling did not extend to higher education. </p>\n\n<p>In 1996, Congress approved the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/illegal_immigration_reform_and_immigration_responsibility_act\">Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act</a>, which made it harder for undocumented immigrants who are deported to reenter the U.S., among other changes to increase border security. </p>\n\n<p>This law also said that states could not provide <a href=\"https://floridacollegeaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRB-Undocumented-students.pdf\">in-state tuition</a> to undocumented students at public universities, unless they gave the same benefits to out-of-state American citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in the early 2000s, a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/06/texas-gop-in-state-tuition-undocumented-students/\">bipartisan group of Texas representatives</a> helped <a href=\"https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-dream-act-house-bill-1403\">pass a bill</a> that opened up in-state tuition to undocumented students. The bill based tuition and scholarships on <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">specific residency requirements</a>, such as graduating from high school in the state, allowing the bill to circumvent the 1996 federal law. </p>\n\n<p>Also in the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.cccco.edu/-/media/CCCCO-Website/Files/General-Counsel/x_ab-540-flyer-ada.pdf\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://open.illinois.edu/legislation-policies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"https://wsac.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2015.1079Report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Washington</a> and <a href=\"https://dreamact.info/students/in-state/new-york?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">New York</a> also passed similar legislation that allows undocumented immigrants to receive in-state tuition – and in some cases, state scholarships – at state universities.</p>\n\n<p>Even some conservative states, <a href=\"https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/8228ef9c-712a-4df8-a759-99d218c2c716/content\">such as Utah</a>, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-70/section-70-3242/\">Oklahoma and</a> <a href=\"https://ksrevisor.gov/statutes/chapters/ch76/076_007_0031a.html\">Kansas</a>, passed such legislation during the early 2000s that let undocumented immigrants pay in-state tuition at public universities and colleges.</p>\n\n<h2>The tide turns</h2>\n\n<p>But just a few years later, things began to shift.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/state/south-carolina/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">South Carolina became the first state</a> to ban undocumented students from studying at public colleges and universities altogether. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/us/14georgia.html\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04immig.html\">Alabama</a> quickly followed suit with similar bans.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, after Congress created the <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/work/daca/\">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> program to allow immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to temporarily work, study and stay in the U.S., some schools in South Carolina <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/dreams-derailed#:%7E:text=South%20Carolina%20enacted%20the%20enrollment,on%20the%20states'%20economic%20vitality.\">briefly banned DACA students</a> from attending public universities – despite the new federal law. </p>\n\n<p>The schools <a href=\"https://che.sc.gov/sites/che/files/Documents/Meetings/2019/Residency_Regional_Workshop_2019.pdf\">reversed course</a> the next year <a href=\"https://www.aclusc.org/press-releases/aclu-of-sc-challenges-state-institutions-to-comply-with-federal-guidance-on-higher-education-admission-for-immigrant-students/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">following a lawsuit</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, but still required DACA students to pay out-of-state tuition.</p>\n\n<p>Until 2015, South Carolina even denied in-state tuition for some <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/stories/splc-lawsuit-south-carolina-tuition-policy-discriminates-against-students-violates-us/\">American citizens with undocumented parents</a>. The state reversed the policy following a lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>The trend toward more restrictive policies toward undocumented students has continued during the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>In February 2025, Florida passed a law that <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/02/20/florida-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">revoked in-state tuition</a> for undocumented students. Florida <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/244/ByVersion?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">still allows</a> undocumented immigrants to enroll at public colleges and universities, as long as they pay full tuition. </p>\n\n<p>And over the summer, the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/in-state-tuition-no-longer-offered-to-some-immigrant-students-in-oklahoma/\">challenged Oklahoma’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-texas-reach-agreement-end-state-tuition-illegal-aliens\">and Texas’</a> in-state tuition policies, which had allowed all undocumented students to pay in-state tuition. </p>\n\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/texas-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">states quickly</a> <a href=\"https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/in-state-tuition-no-longer-offered-to-some-immigrant-students-in-oklahoma/\">ended their</a> policies. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/26/texas-colleges-undocumented-students-guidance/\">Texas and</a> <a href=\"https://www.uscisguide.com/education/state-legislation-supporting-immigrant-access-to-higher-education-in-oklahoma/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Oklahoma still</a> allow DACA recipients to attend public universities and pay in-state tuition rates. </p>\n\n<p>As of 2025, <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/\">22 states and Washington D.C.</a> allow undocumented students to pay <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">in-state tuition</a>. The remaining states, meanwhile, either do not have a state policy, require undocumented immigrants to pay out-of-state tuition, or bar them entirely from attending public universities. </p>\n\n<h2>A challenging environment</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, these shifts make it harder for many undocumented students to go to and stay in college. </p>\n\n<p>The price of in-state tuition at public universities varies, but it typically offers <a href=\"https://finaid.org/otheraid/stateresidency/\">in-state residents a much lower tuition</a> rate than students coming from out of state. While the average in-state tuition at public colleges <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/resources/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">costs about US$11,610</a> for the 2024-25 school year, out-of-state students paid $30,780, on average, during this same time frame. </p>\n\n<p>Undocumented students <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/undocumented-students\">do not qualify</a> for federal financial aid, so paying out-of-state tuition at a public university usually prevents immigrants from pursuing a college degree.</p>\n\n<p>Some research shows that in-state tuition policies help reduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.12.009\">undocumented college students’ dropout rates</a> by about 8%.</p>\n\n<p>In-state tuition policies also <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ875718\">increase college enrollment</a> of noncitizen Latino students by 54%.</p>\n\n<h2>A blockade for students</h2>\n\n<p>I began teaching social studies at a high school in South Carolina in 2012, soon after many of these restrictions on immigrant students were enacted. I found that many educators and students were not aware of these restrictions until students applied to colleges or sought state licenses. </p>\n\n<p>My students included DACA recipients who completed a two-year program in areas like cosmetology, only then to be told they would not be allowed to practice in the state. </p>\n\n<p>My later research focused on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15348431.2021.1995388\">DACA students who aspired to become</a> educators but had to either stop pursuing that goal or go out of state to teach. Other immigrant students I surveyed in my research said they lost motivation in the high school classroom due to the restrictions to pursue higher education.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An aerial view shows a large group of people walking together on a track.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706539/original/file-20251204-56-w7bpih.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Students stage a walkout at a high school in Charlotte, N.C., on Nov. 18, 2025, protesting Border Patrol operations targeting undocumented immigrants.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-an-aerial-view-students-stage-a-walkout-at-east-news-photo/2247309156?adppopup=true\">John Moore/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Carryover effects</h2>\n\n<p>Policies that make it easier for undocumented immigrants to attend college don’t just affect individual students and their families – they also have a positive effect on local economies. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23315024241287505\">Research from 2025</a> shows that when undocumented students can pay in-state tuition, they become more likely to have a job after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>Another study from Clemson University and the nonprofit group Hispanic Alliance found that South Carolina could be losing <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/daca-south-carolina-jobs-licensed-fields-economy/article_559ea88a-e878-11ee-b525-2b0996e72e82.html\">up to $68 million</a> a year in revenue due to the license policy for DACA recipients. </p>\n\n<p>I have known undocumented people who are aspiring doctors and teachers and moved to other states since they could not study or receive professional licenses in South Carolina. </p>\n\n<p>Restrictive education policies could mean that some of the most talented immigrant students <a href=\"https://hispanicalliancesc.com/allied4work/\">will leave</a> their respective states.

Media and political conversations often use words or terms such as “fading,” “white,” “farming,” “traditional” and “politically uniform” to describe rural communities. </p>\n\n<p>In reality, rural communities are far more varied. Getting these facts right matters because public debates, policies and resources – including money for programs – often rely on these assumptions, and misunderstandings can leave real needs neglected.</p>\n\n<p>We are rural demographers at <a href=\"https://lsu.edu/hss/sociology/people/faculty/profiles/slack_tim.php\">Louisiana State University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/shannon-monnat\">Syracuse University</a> who study the causes and consequences of well-being in rural America. Here we outline six myths about rural America – a few among many – highlighted in our recent book “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">Rural and Small-Town America: Context, Composition, and Complexities</a>.”\n<div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 1: Rural America is disappearing due to depopulation</h2>\n\n<p>Many people think rural America is emptying out. The story is more complicated. It’s true that <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/rural-america-lost-population-over-past-decade-first-time-history\">from 2010 to 2020 most rural counties lost population. But about one-third grew</a>, especially those near cities or those with lakes, mountains and other natural attractions. And there have been times, like in the 1970s and 1990s, when rural populations grew faster than cities – <a href=\"https://www.nrs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/book/nc_2002_johnson_001.pdf\">periods called “rural rebounds.</a>”</p>\n\n<p>An important thing to know about rural population change is that the places defined as “rural” change over time. When a rural town grows enough, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-classifications/what-is-rural\">reclassifies it as “urban</a>.” In other words, rural America isn’t disappearing – it’s changing and sometimes urbanizing.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"hAQ2R\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hAQ2R/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 2: Most rural Americans live on farms</h2>\n\n<p>Farming is still important in many rural places, but it’s no longer the way most rural Americans make a living. Today, <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">roughly 6% of rural jobs are in agriculture</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/market-intel/the-other-paycheck-how-off-farm-income-keeps-farmers-farming\">most farm families also have members who work off-farm jobs</a>, often for access to health insurance and retirement benefits.</p>\n\n<p>A bigger source of employment in rural America is manufacturing. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/changes-in-the-us-economy-and-rural-urban-employment-disparities-20240119.html\">manufacturing plays a larger role as a share of jobs and earnings in rural areas than in cities</a>. That also means that deindustrialization – steady job losses in manufacturing over the decades – has been especially painful in rural America. Unlike large cities with lots of employers, rural communities rely on just a few. When <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tyson-foods-chicken-plant-closures-rural-manufacturing-rcna100434\">a rural plant or factory closes, the local impacts are often devastating</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The largest share of rural jobs today <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">is in service-sector work</a>, such as retail, food service, home health care and hospitality. These jobs often pay low wages, offer few benefits and have unstable hours, making it harder for many rural families to stay financially secure.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"d3usM\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/d3usM/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 3: Only white people live in rural America</h2>\n\n<p>People often picture rural America as mostly white, <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/growing-racial-diversity-rural-america-results-2020-census\">but that’s not the full story</a>. About 1 in 4 rural residents are nonwhite. Hispanic and Black people make up the largest shares, and Indigenous people have a greater portion of their population living in rural areas than any other racial group.</p>\n\n<p>Rural America is also getting more racially and ethnically diverse every year. Young people are leading that change: About <a href=\"https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/growing-racial-diversity-rural-america-results-2020-census\">1 in 3 rural children are nonwhite</a>. The future of rural America is racially diverse, even if popular images don’t always show it.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"2gjf2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2gjf2/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 4: Rural America is healthier than urban America</h2>\n\n<p>Many people imagine rural life as healthier than city life. But the opposite is true. <a href=\"https://surface.syr.edu/lerner/9/\">People in rural areas die younger and at higher rates</a> than people in cities. Scholars call this the “<a href=\"https://surface.syr.edu/lerner/9/\">rural mortality penalty,” and it has been widening for years</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic made the gap even larger due to <a href=\"https://egrove.olemiss.edu/jrss/vol37/iss2/3/\">higher death rates in rural communities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t just because rural areas have more older people. Rural working-age people, ages 25 to 64, are dying younger than their urban peers, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article-abstract/35/1/3/8051779\">and the gap is growing</a>. This trend is being <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">driven by nearly all major causes of death</a>. Rural residents have higher rates of early death from cancers, heart disease, COVID-19, motor vehicle crashes, suicide, alcohol misuse, diabetes, stroke and pregnancy-related complications.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"NPsq5\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NPsq5/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 5: Rural families are more traditional than urban families</h2>\n\n<p>Images of rural life often evoke households in which married couples are raising children in traditional family structures. Historically, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11237867\">rural children were more likely to live with married parents. But that’s no longer the case</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, rural children are less likely than urban children <a href=\"https://rprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clark_2024-2_FINAL.pdf\">to live with married parents</a> and are more likely to live with cohabiting unmarried parents or in the care of grandparents or other relatives. Partly as a result, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=110356\">rural child poverty rates are higher</a> than urban rates, and many <a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/halt-in-snap-benefits-will-hurt-millions-of-rural-families/2025/\">rural families rely on safety-net supports such as the food aid program SNAP</a>. Rural families are diverse, and many are economically vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"KXHUw\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KXHUw/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Myth 6: A new ‘rural revolt’ gave Donald Trump his presidential victories</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734668/\">Many rural voters have supported Donald Trump</a>, but this didn’t happen overnight. </p>\n\n<p>For much of the 20th century, Democrats drew major support from rural areas due to the <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rural-and-small-town-america/paper\">party’s alignment with the working class and 100 years of single-party rule in the South</a> spanning Reconstruction to the civil rights era. </p>\n\n<p>However, social class and regional flips in voting patterns have meant rural voters have been shifting toward Republicans for nearly 50 years. The last time rural and urban residents voted within 1 percentage point  of each other was in 1976, when Georgia peanut farmer and former governor Jimmy Carter was elected.</p>\n\n<p>The partisan gap between rural and urban voters averaged 3 percentage points in the 1980s and 1990s, before growing to 10 percentage points in the 2000s and 20 percentage points in recent cycles. So, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734668/\">Trump’s support in rural America was not a new “revolt</a>” but part of a long-term trend.</p>\n\n<p>And in 2024, the key geographic story wasn’t rural voters at all – it was the sharp drop in turnout in big cities. Both candidates got fewer urban votes than in 2020, with Kamala Harris capturing over <a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/in-the-race-for-the-presidency-gop-turnout-declined-democratic-turnout-collapsed/2024/11/08/\">10 million fewer votes in major and medium-sized cities</a> than Joe Biden had four years earlier.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"8Zhxv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8Zhxv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269037/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tim Slack has received funding from the NSF, USDA, NIH, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Energy, Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon M.

The song was not a commercial success, so he focused on playing drums for a number of local bands.</p>\n\n<p>In 1970, Pendergrass was invited by Philly soul and R&amp;B singer Harold Melvin to play drums with his group, the Blue Notes. During a performance, Pendergrass sang along, leading Melvin to invite him to take over as <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk-of-fame/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">lead vocalist after John Atkins left the group</a>. The following year, <a href=\"https://www.soundofphiladelphia.com/artist/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes</a> signed a record deal with the newly created <a href=\"https://www.soundofphiladelphia.com/about/\">Philadelphia International Records</a>, forging a partnership between Pendergrass and label founders and legendary producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff that would last over a decade.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Five male musicians dressed in dark suits perform on stage in front of microphones\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706256/original/file-20251203-56-3h3yeb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Teddy Pendergrass (second from right) performs with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes at the Greek Theatre in 1973 in Los Angeles.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/soul-singer-teddy-pendergrass-performs-with-harold-melvin-news-photo/95880269\">Sherry Rayn Barnett /Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Philadelphia International’s influence was felt throughout the music industry, with Gamble and Huff producing many of the hits performed by the label’s artists. <a href=\"https://www.bmi.com/special/gamble-huff-bell\">Gamble and Huff</a> blended soul and funk with complex horn and string arrangements to create the Philly soul sound. </p>\n\n<p>This sound became key in the development of disco, smooth jazz and <a href=\"https://timeline.carnegiehall.org/genres/neo-soul\">neo-soul</a>. Slower, more intimate R&amp;B and smooth jazz also formed the foundation for the “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/what-is-quiet-storm-music/25845/\">quiet storm</a>” radio format that Pendergrass helped foster as a solo artist on stations like <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/celebrated-wdas-radio-personality-tony-brown-dies-at-75/\">WDAS in Philadelphia</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Marvin Gaye’s 1973 album “<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/music-news/getting-marvin-gaye-came-two-sexiest-songs-time-014704514.html\">Let’s Get It On</a>” was Motown’s response to the emergence of Philly Soul, and helped popularize more explicitly sensual R&amp;B and soul.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk-of-fame/harold-melvin-the-blue-notes/\">Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes</a> had their first No. 1 hit with 1972’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Qgh0_JF5o\">If You Don’t Know Me by Now</a>.” While on the Philadelphia International label, the group recorded four gold records between 1972 and 1976.

He was selling out concerts, and legendary producer Shep Gordon recognized that the vast majority of the attendees were women. This led to Pendergrass’ “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/10/17/163095398/for-the-ladies-r-kelly-teddy-pendergrass-and-the-state-of-r-b\">Ladies Only</a>” tour in 1978, which became a template for future soul and R&amp;B tours by contemporaries like Luther Vandross and <a href=\"https://wers.org/vault-of-soul-teddy-pendergrass/\">later artists like Ginuwine</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ginuwine-jagged-edge-team-to-tour-60245/\">tours were also marketed specifically to women</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The 1979 erotic hit “Turn Off the Lights” strengthened Pendergrass’ reputation as a sex symbol. While Marvin Gaye <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-20/crimes-of-the-times-death-of-marvin-gaye\">was dealing with both financial and personal issues</a>, Pendergrass became the top performer of soul “<a href=\"https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/best_r_b_songs_of_the_70s/s1__40688097\">bedroom ballads</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Pendergrass and Gaye, along with other contemporaries like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBf6RErcQM0\">Barry White</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I3UTG1dSTc\">Minnie Riperton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyxKSEOg2iQ\">Donna Summer</a>, included more explicitly erotic themes and lyrics than earlier artists. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Gaye’s “Let’s Get it On,” he implores to his lover: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s nothin’ wrong with me / Lovin’ you, baby love, love / And givin’ yourself to me can never be wrong / If the love is true, oh baby.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In “Close the Door,” Pendergrass similarly tells his lover: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Close the door / Let me give you what you’ve been waiting for / Baby I got so much love to give / And I wanna give it all … to you …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One challenge for the songwriters like <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2021/04/10/the-sound-of-philadelphia-history/\">Gamble and Huff</a> was to balance the sensuality that fans loved with Federal Communication Commission <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/obscene-indecent-and-profane-broadcasts\">rules regarding profane language</a>. Songs like “Turn Down the Lights,” written by Gamble and Huff for Pendergrass, describe a <a href=\"https://victoriaadvocate.com/2010/01/14/as-a-sex-symbol-teddy-pendergrass-was-romantic-not-explicit/\">detailed night of romance</a> without language that would be considered obscene by the FCC.</p>\n\n<h2>Slow jams and sex positivity</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/03/22/play-another-slow-jam-this-time-make-it-sweet/\">R&amp;B and soul slow jams</a> by artists like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npJEvAETHVU\">Freddie Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u_u4nlYmNs\">Vandross</a> dominated bedroom music through the 1980s, although derivative genres like neo-soul and quiet storm continued to produce bedroom ballads like Gaye’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjlSiASsUIs\">Sexual Healing</a>” in 1982. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/05/madonna-vs-cyndi-lauper-careers-taught-art/\">Madonna and Cyndi Lauper</a> helped bring a female perspective to more sex-positive pop music with songs including “Like a Virgin” and “She Bop.” <a href=\"https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2002/12/04/rhythms-that-make-yo/\">Janet Jackson and Salt-N-Pepa</a> did the same in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HO9H1VMMOk\">R&amp;B</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g\">hip-hop</a>. Other groups embraced their sex symbol status through the 1990s, exemplified by TLC’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmH4_pr6mH0\">Ain’t 2 Proud 2 Beg</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlZydtG3xqI\">Creep</a>,” and Next’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEZRPkAAu8\">Too Close</a>.” The artists of the 1980s and 1990s were also <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2025/12/02/streaming-killed-video-star\">boosted by MTV</a>, bringing a visual element to their sensual lyrics.</p>\n\n<p>The emergence of <a href=\"https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/little-did-the-90s-know-it-but-bell-biv-devoes-brand-of-new-jack-swing/article_6799434a-34d1-5f1d-ab6e-177338b72a85.html\">new jack swing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/new-jack-swing-summer-1988-new-edition-bobby-brown-8462009/\">a term coined in 1987</a> to define a new style that combined dance, hip-hop and R&amp;B, ushered in higher-tempo erotic songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6HNbdi9AA\">Do Me!</a>” by <a href=\"https://bellbivdevoe.com/\">Bel Biv Devoe</a> along with slower bedroom ballads like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV8vB1BB2qc\">I’ll Make Love to You</a>” by Philadelphia’s <a href=\"https://boyziimen.com/\">Boyz II Men</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV8vB1BB2qc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Philly’s Boyz II Men carried the bedroom ballad tradition into the 1990s with “I’ll Make Love to You.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Bedroom ballads with disco-synth makeover</h2>\n\n<p>Philadelphia International’s sound and sensual lyrics have reemerged in recent years through artists Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, whose synth-pop and disco sound can be traced back to Gamble and Huff, and the label’s stable of artists. </p>\n\n<p>Proto-disco songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTt649Hvtxs\">The Love I Lost</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIkcB8GObo\">Don’t Leave Me This Way</a>” by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, and Pendergrass’ disco hit “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAku7KqQPeU\">Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose</a>” – or his later synthesizer-heavy album “Joy” – would influence <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/02/02/arts/music/billie-eilish-charli-xcx-chappell-roan-sabrina-carpenter\">current synth-pop hits</a> like Roan’s disco-influenced “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18\">Pink Pony Club</a>” and Carpenter’s synth-pop “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTLdJ-CM7TQ\">Manchild</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR3Liudev18?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chappell Roan’s campy, disco-influenced hit “Pink Pony Club.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Carpenter in particular has seemingly struck that balance between mainstream success and sensual lyrics. Her past three albums have been certified platinum and embrace increasingly mature themes such as female arousal. </p>\n\n<p>“Man’s Best Friend,” released in August 2025, sparked controversy with a sexually suggestive album cover that further <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250830-sabrina-carpenter-to-taylor-swift-why-female-popstars-embracing-sex-is-still-controversial-in-2025\">cemented her Carpenter’s symbol image</a>. This image is reinforced by her stage presence, like dancing in her underwear on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJP1EBKFsfw\">Saturday Night Live</a>” and mature songs like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vuCByb6js\">Tears</a>,” </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9vuCByb6js?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">“Tears” by Sabrina Carpenter.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Pendergrass’ career was derailed when he lost control of his car on Lincoln Drive in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia in 1982. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/us/singer-suffers-spinal-injury-in-auto-crash-in-philadelphia.html\">The accident left him a tetraplegic</a>.

      "content": "<p>Brazil’s “<a href=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/law/news/2025/09/01/organized-crime-now-also-an-economic-challenge-in-brazil.ghtml\">criminal economy</a>” does not appear on any national balance sheet. Yet the cost of violence, contraband, tax evasion and environmental crime can be measured in the tens of billions of dollars every year and serves as a major drag on Brazil’s economic growth and stability.</p>\n\n<p>Attempts to quantify this burden go back at least a decade. An influential <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and-Violence-New-Evidence-and-Insights-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf\">2017 study by the Inter-American Development Bank</a> estimated that crime and violence consumes roughly 3.4% of gross domestic product across Latin America and the Caribbean, with <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and-Violence-New-Evidence-and-Insights-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Brazil among the worst-affected countries</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasviolencia/noticia/55/gastos-com-a-violencia-no-brasil-correspondem-a-59-do-pib-diz-pesquisa\">later assessment</a> by Brazil’s own Institute for Applied Economic Research put the annual cost of violence alone at 5.9% of GDP. </p>\n\n<p>Such figures are usually calculated by looking at the cost of violence and crime on the lost earnings of people killed or incarcerated through crime, the medical costs of dealing with the aftermath of violence, the increased cost of security, and the value of damaged or stolen property.</p>\n\n<p>But headline figures still miss much of what never shows up in ledgers. They rarely capture the welfare cost of a homicide, the long-term earnings lost when a teen drops out of school because his neighborhood is dangerous, or the investment that never materializes because a company fears extortion or theft. </p>\n\n<p>As such, some researchers <a href=\"https://pesquisa.ie.unicamp.br/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2019/06/IPEA-Atlas-da-Violencia-2019.pdf\">contend</a> that even a 5.9% estimate should be seen as a lower bound on the cost of violence. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, a <a href=\"https://exame.com/revista-exame/13-trilhao-de-reais-para-o-crime/\">recent analysis</a> of official statistics and private surveys suggest that once indirect losses are fully accounted for, crime may be shaving <a href=\"https://interlira-reports.com/featured/the-impact-of-violence-on-businesses-in-brazil-part-2/07/08/2023/\">around 11%</a> off Brazil’s annual GDP. I believe the real cost could be even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath these totals lies an enormous underground economy that both feeds and conceals illegality. The Underground Economy Index <a href=\"https://www.etco.org.br/projetos/economia-subterranea/economia-subterranea-movimenta-r-17-trilhoes-no-brasil-e-volta-ao-padrao-pre-pandemia/\">estimates that unregistered or informal activity</a> accounted for 17.8% of Brazil’s GDP in 2022, or <a href=\"https://www.etco.org.br/tag/indice-de-economia-subterranea/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">around US$313 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Not all of that is criminal. For many microbusinesses, an informal economy is a survival strategy. But such a vast cash-based economy offers ideal cover for smuggling, tax fraud, counterfeit goods and money laundering, making enforcement vastly more complex.</p>\n\n<h2>From contraband to cargo theft</h2>\n\n<p>Illicit commerce now mirrors the formal economy in scale and diversity. A <a href=\"https://exame.com/economia/contrabando-falsificacao-e-pirataria-prejuizo-chega-a-quase-meio-trilhao-de-reais-diz-fncp/\">recent survey</a> by the National Forum Against Piracy and Illegality found that contraband, falsification and piracy cost Brazil roughly $86 billion in 2024, including $60 billion in lost sales for legitimate companies and $25 billion in unpaid taxes. </p>\n\n<p>Tobacco, clothing, fuel, electronics and pharmaceuticals were among the hardest-hit sectors. Economists <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-72968-8_4\">caution</a> that such figures, based on self-reported industry losses, are imprecise; however, they do underscore how deeply illegal trade has penetrated mainstream markets.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil’s logistics sector offers a particularly stark illustration of how crime acts as a hidden surcharge on everyday goods. According to data compiled by the National Association of Cargo Transport and Logistics, the national haulage association, Brazil recorded <a href=\"https://jornal.usp.br/atualidades/roubo-de-cargas-bate-recorde-em-2024-com-prejuizo-de-r-12-bilhao/\">10,478 cargo thefts</a> in 2024, with estimated losses of $221 million. </p>\n\n<p>When the cost of fuel-related thefts and fraud are added, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-brazils-fuel-mafias-and-their-gas-station-money-laundering-machines-254422\">annual losses rise</a> to $5.34 billion. These crimes, concentrated along major freight corridors in the southeast of the country, force companies to invest in trackers, armored convoys and route changes – costs that ripple through supply chains and ultimately into final prices.</p>\n\n<h2>The new environmental criminal frontier</h2>\n\n<p>Brazil’s criminal economy also burrows into its rivers and forests. A <a href=\"https://escolhas.org/novo-estudo-do-escolhas-revela-quase-metade-do-ouro-produzido-no-brasil-pode-ser-ilegal/\">landmark study</a> by the Choices Institute, a Brazilian think tank, documented that between 2015 and 2020, the country traded 229 tons of gold with signs of illegality, <a href=\"https://escolhas.org/novo-estudo-do-escolhas-revela-quase-metade-do-ouro-produzido-no-brasil-pode-ser-ilegal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">nearly half of total production over that period</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Much of this “suspect” gold <a href=\"https://projetocolabora.com.br/ods16/quase-metade-do-ouro-brasileiro-tem-indicios-de-ilegalidade/\">appears to originate</a> from Indigenous territories or environmental protection areas in the Amazon. That volume is worth tens of billions of dollars, providing a ready vehicle for laundering proceeds from other illicit markets while starving the treasury of royalties and taxes.</p>\n\n<p>The environmental ledger may be the most underappreciated of all. The MapBiomas Alerta project <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/\">confirmed</a> 74,218 deforestation alerts – which give authorities a heads-up on potential logging, fires or land clearance activity – in 2020 across Brazil, covering nearly 5370 square miles (13,900 square kilometers). An <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/RAD2020_FactSheet_FINAL_PT.pdf\">analysis</a> of those alerts found that nearly all bore signs of illegality. These trends have not changed. </p>\n\n<p>Deforestation in the Amazon not only eliminates trees, but it also drains the economy. A recent <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/pt-br/press-release/desmatamento-na-amazonia-ameaca-seguranca-energetica-do-pais-e-gera-perdas-de-bilhoes-para-setor-eletrico/\">study by the Climate Policy Initiative</a> estimates that Brazil’s Itaipu and Belo Monte hydroelectric plants together lose around 3,700 to 3,800 gigawatt-hours of potential generation each year because deforestation has weakened the “<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/amazon-water-flying-rivers-latin-america/\">flying rivers</a>” that carry moisture from the forest to the rest of Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>That lost energy, enough to provide power to roughly 1.5 million people, translates into more than $184 million in foregone revenue annually.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A fire is seen in a forest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/707213/original/file-20251208-66-2x0gjn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Smoke from an illegal fire in Amazon state.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/smoke-from-illegal-fires-lit-by-farmers-rises-in-manaquiri-news-photo/1651329389?adppopup=true\">Michael Dantas/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lawlessness is a regressive tax</h2>\n\n<p>No single study can capture the entirety of Brazil’s criminal economy. Still, putting together the most conservative official numbers yields a rough balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>And even a cautious estimate would put the total cost at around <a href=\"https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/economia/macroeconomia/amazonia-vale-sete-vezes-mais-em-pe-cerca-de-r-15-tri-por-ano-diz-banco-mundial/\">$239 billion to $275 billion</a> annually – or 12% to 14% of Brazil’s GDP, by my estimate.</p>\n\n<p>These costs of crime are a hidden regressive tax, falling hardest on poor Brazilians who are more exposed to violence, more dependent on public services and less able to hedge against inflation or instability.</p>\n\n<p>And every dollar lost to corruption, contraband or illegal deforestation is a dollar that cannot be invested in schools, hospitals or clean energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Countering crime</h2>\n\n<p>There are, however, tentative signs that lawmakers and authorities are beginning to act on this calculus. The Finance Ministry has asked Congress to accelerate a <a href=\"https://www.otempo.com.br/politica/governo/2025/11/14/haddad-pede-que-camara-se-sensibilize-e-aprove-projetos-de-combate-ao-crime-organizado\">package of bills</a> that sharpen the definition and treatment of companies that bake systematic tax evasion into their business model, and to arm prosecutors and tax authorities with stronger tools to overcome the convoluted financial structures that shield them.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of a permanent unit to fight organized crime within the Justice Ministry, bringing together federal tax authorities, federal police, public prosecutors and state-level task forces, also points to a <a href=\"https://exame.com/brasil/o-crime-se-sofistica-e-o-estado-deve-se-sofisticar-contra-ele-diz-haddad-sobre-megaoperacao/\">growing recognition</a> that criminal entities operating within the formal economy can only be reached if fiscal, financial and criminal laws are applied in a coordinated way. </p>\n\n<p>In parallel, national authorities have signaled an intention to negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/brasil-busca-cooperacao-com-eua-para-combater-o-crime-organizado\">new cooperation framework</a> with Washington centered on information-sharing around money laundering, arms trafficking and large-scale tax fraud – embedding the fight against organized crime more explicitly in bilateral economic talks.</p>\n\n<p>And recent enforcement actions offer a glimpse of what a more systemic approach looks like in practice. In August 2025, [federal and state police] cracked down on a national criminal network that used a fintech “shadow bank” and at least 40 investment funds to launder illegal transactions involving roughly 1,000 gas stations from 2020 to 2024. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in November, Brazilian authorities <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2025/novembro/operacao-poco-de-lobato-receita-federal-e-orgaos-parceiros-desarticulam-esquema-bilionario-ligado-a-operacao-carbono-oculto\">executed 126 search and seizure warrants</a> in five states and secured judicial orders to freeze more than $1.8 billion in assets relating to criminal activities. </p>\n\n<p>These measures suggest that Brazil’s institutions – and the lawmakers who shape them – are beginning to treat crime not as an unavoidable backdrop to economic life, but as a macroeconomic distortion that can, and should, be confronted head-on.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is a translation of an article for The Conversation Brazil.

But as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxybJ_sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a scholar</a> of religion and politics, I have often seen how religious diplomacy complements conventional diplomatic tools – the pope’s visit being the most recent example.</p>\n\n<h2>Turkey and religious freedom</h2>\n\n<p>Lebanon and Turkey have a long history of Christianity, dating back to the early centuries of the religion. The Bible mentions <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:21-28&amp;version=NIV\">Jesus visiting Tyre and Sidon, coastal cities in Lebanon</a>. Many early Christian communities thrived in lands of modern-day Turkey, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CHO9781139600507.035\">such as Ephesus, Antioch and Cappadocia</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Despite Turkey’s significance in the history of Christianity, today Christians constitute less than 0.5% of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/christians-have-lived-in-turkey-for-two-millennia-but-their-future-is-uncertain-127296\">its population</a>. These include diverse Christian communities, from Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox to Roman Catholic and Protestant. </p>\n\n<p>Turkey’s constitution guarantees religious freedom, but Christians face legal and administrative hurdles in matters such as <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/alien-citizens-state-and-religious-minorities-turkey-and-france\">building places of worship</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The pope’s visit did not directly confront these structural issues, but the trip itself drew international <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pope-leo-xiv-opens-foreign-trip-visit-turkey-127923511\">attention to the plight of Christians</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The pope met with Muslim leaders to foster dialogue. He visited Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, an architectural icon for Turkish Muslims. In a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the pope emphasized Turkey’s role as “<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251127-pope-to-meet-erdogan-in-turkey-in-first-overseas-trip\">a bridge between East and West, Asia and Europe</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Even the pro-government media, which does not usually support rights for religious minorities, highlighted Turkey’s responsibility to provide religious freedoms for its <a href=\"https://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/papa-xiv-leonun-turkiye-ziyaretine-iliskin-ortaya-atilan-iddialar-tek-tek-curutuldu-iste-maddelerle-gercekler-7474197\">Christian minorities</a> in its coverage of the trip. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/707252/original/file-20251209-56-af8b5u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Several people walking in a large dome-like structure with high ceilings.

They are followed by Greek Orthodox communities, concentrated in Beirut and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203864630\">Mount Lebanon</a>. Other groups include Melkite Greek Catholics, Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, Assyrians, Chaldean Catholics, Copts and various Protestant communities. </p>\n\n<p>Christians in Lebanon enjoy constitutional protections and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5474992_LEBANON-2023-INTERNATIONAL-RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM-REPORT.pdf\">better political representation</a> than Christians in other Middle Eastern countries. Lebanon’s confessional system allocates power among <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/melg/6/3/article-p250_5.xml\">religious communities</a>. The president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the speaker of the parliament must be a Shia Muslim; parliament and cabinet seats are split equally between Christians and Muslims. </p>\n\n<p>However, Christians are concerned with their <a href=\"https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1486323/from-north-to-south-lebanons-christians-live-in-fear-of-a-great-decline.html\">decreasing population in Lebanon</a>. They constituted over 50% of the population when Lebanon <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40262539\">gained its independence from France in 1943</a>. Over the years, many Christians left Lebanon because of economic pressures, <a href=\"https://eclj.org/religious-freedom/un/sud-liban-reconstruire-esperance-chretiens-pris-entre-deux-fronts\">the dominance of the Shia group Hezbollah</a> and insecurity stemming from Israeli strikes. </p>\n\n<p>The pope advised political leaders to prioritize cooperation over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/pope-leo-xiv/pope-leo-xiv-calls-lebanese-leaders-for-peace-rcna246560\">sectarian interests</a> within its confessional political system. As a gesture, he joined Muslim leaders in Martyrs’ Square in Beirut and shared readings from <a href=\"https://www.asianews.it/news-en/Popes-words-in-Beiruts-Martyrs'-Square-echo-among-the-people-64393.html\">both the Gospels and the Quran</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Moral boost</h2>\n\n<p>The pope’s visit provided a morale boost for <a href=\"https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2025/12/pastors-in-lebanon-hope-papal-visit-will-give-boost-to-christians-civil-rights\">Lebanese Christians</a>. Many saw the pope’s presence as encouragement to stay in Lebanon <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pope-visit-christian-sites-lebanon-encourages-christians-abandon-127992830\">despite all the concerns</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, some <a href=\"https://www.wrkf.org/npr-news/2025-11-29/popes-visit-to-lebanon-sparks-hope-but-also-frustration\">expressed disappointment</a> that the pope did not travel to southern Lebanon, where Christian villages have suffered from Israeli strikes. </p>\n\n<p>However, the pope reiterated the Vatican’s support for a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/world/middleeast/pope-leo-two-state-solution-israel.html\">two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian</a> conflict as the only way to resolve “the conflict they continually live.” </p>\n\n<h2>Religious diplomacy</h2>\n\n<p>Through his visits to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV intertwined religious teachings with cultural gestures to promote a message of peaceful coexistence.</p>\n\n<p>By meeting Christian groups in Turkey and Lebanon, he offered moral support and visibility to minorities facing insecurity and emigration pressures. By meeting with Muslim leaders, he showcased the Vatican’s commitment to coexistence and dialogue with Islam.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the pope’s religious diplomacy will lead to tangible policy outcomes. Yet, one thing is clear: Religious diplomacy serves as a valuable tool for encouraging dialogue and understanding as it did with the pope’s visit.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271208/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ramazan Kılınç does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It dovetails, moreover, with a ubiquitous political slogan: “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/hillary-clinton-just-said-it-but-the-future-is-female-began-as-a-1970s-lesbian-separatist-slogan/\">The future is female</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-trump-promotes-a-radical-unscientific-theory-about-sex-and-gender-in-the-name-of-opposing-gender-ideology-extremism-250552\">historical moment</a> when society is bitterly contesting ideas about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/anti-trans-measures-dont-just-target-transgender-men-and-women-a-sociologist-explains-how-male-or-female-categories-miss-the-mark-for-nonbinary-americans-251443\">gender</a>, we’d note that these notions still rely on a simplistic binary.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://religiousstudies.calpoly.edu/faculty-staff/anya-foxen\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.uh.edu/class/ccs/people/borkataky-varma/\">scholars</a> who study the entangled history of spirituality and gender, we often observe an especially fraught version of this dynamic playing out among “spiritual but not religious” practitioners, often called spiritual seekers. To many such people, the divine feminine represents an escape from oppressive gender norms, and yet many stumble in trying to reconcile the idea with the embodied realities of biological sex.</p>\n\n<p>An approach that escapes this dilemma is the centuries-old Kundalini tradition, which paints a model of the divine feminine beyond gender altogether.</p>\n\n<h2>The feminine Shakti</h2>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-the-early-church-thought-about-gods-gender-100077\">certainly examples</a> of the feminine divine to be drawn from Christian and other Abrahamic religious traditions. Yet many seekers quickly find themselves reaching beyond these borders.</p>\n\n<p>When they do, one of the first concepts they come across is Shakti, a divine feminine energy that manifests in the human body as the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-serpents-tale/9780231559430/\">electrifying force of Kundalini</a>. Both terms originate in South Asian religions – especially Hinduism – that fall under the broad umbrella of tantra. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691057798/tantra-in-practice\">Tantric cultural and spiritual traditions</a>, which began to emerge in the early centuries of the Common Era, take a positive perspective on the material world in general and the human body in particular, as opposed to traditions that regard both as inherently illusory or sinful. In tantra, the material world and physical body are suffused by divine energy. This energy is called Shakti, and it is feminine.</p>\n\n<p>Another key idea common to tantric traditions is that the universe is composed of two fundamental principles – or rather that it has two poles: a dynamic energy, which is female, balanced by an unchanging consciousness, which is male. As the great Goddess, Shakti goes by many names, including Durga, Kali and myriad others. The masculine principle is usually called Shiva, though this can vary as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Divinity beyond binaries</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780197549889.001.0001\">Tantric traditions</a> span over a millennium in time and a subcontinent in space, so it should come as no surprise that they are incredibly diverse. However, most practices that enjoy global popularity today, especially those centered on the divine feminine energy of Kundalini, can be traced to a specific tradition called <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/K/Kundalini\">Kaula Tantra</a>, which developed in the northeast of modern-day India near Kashmir.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left \">\n            <img alt=\"An old painting of a many-armed religious figure.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706115/original/file-20251203-76-gy843a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=977&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A picture of tantric art from the 19th century.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/tantra-is-an-esoteric-current-of-hinduism-the-word-tantra-news-photo/1354453057?adppopup=true\">Pictures From History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This tradition is distinctive by maintaining that while the cosmos is polar, it is also nondual, meaning that there is only one ultimate reality. So, the pairing of Shakti and Shiva, feminine and masculine, energy and consciousness, is best understood not as a binary but as the two sides of a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-timeless-journey-of-the-moebius-strip/\">Mobiüs strip</a>, where one seamlessly flows into the other.</p>\n\n<p>Take a strip of paper, twist it into a figure eight – also the symbol we use for infinity – and glue the back to the front. That’s the Kaula model of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>In such a world, Shiva is Shakti. The masculine is the feminine. Both are divine, but even more than this, both are ultimate, because there is no difference between them. God is goddess, and both are nonbinary.</p>\n\n<h2>Awakening Kundalini</h2>\n\n<p>Kundalini yoga is a centuries-old practice quite different from the branded version popularized more recently by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/us/yogi-bhajan-75-boss-of-worlds-spiritual-and-capitalistic-dies.html\">Yogi Bhajan</a>. It involves using complex meditative and physical techniques to awaken and raise this energy from its usual resting place in the bottom of the torso.</p>\n\n<p>In doing this, tradition says the practitioner experiences a radical transformation both of the body and of consciousness. Premodern texts describe Kundalini’s fiery energy burning through the tissues of the body, shooting up to the crown of the head, where the feminine Shakti unites with her masculine counterpart and all dissolves into oneness.</p>\n\n<p>While some texts treat this ascent as equivalent to a sort of voluntary death, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/537595/roots-of-yoga-by-translated-and-edited-with-an-introduction-by-james-mallinson-and-mark-singleton/\">others describe how, once she has ascended</a>, Kundalini returns to bathe the body in a cooling nectar of immortality, resulting in an embodied state of enlightenment and liberation.</p>\n\n<p>According to this tradition, the body may appear the same but is now enlivened with a new consciousness that has transcended all dualities – including male and female.</p>\n\n<h2>Is the divine feminine female?</h2>\n\n<p>Human gender norms often prove difficult to shake, however. Though the energy of Kundalini is understood as feminine, Kundalini yoga in South Asia has been traditionally practiced by men. The reasons for this are perhaps almost entirely social, and yet they remain a powerful force.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, the very fact that Kundalini is often believed to be associated with womanhood has resulted in women being excluded – or at least deprioritized – from cultivating their own practice. Instead, they have historically become <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/K/bo3617827.html\">assistants or accessories</a> to the enlightenment of men.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-serpents-tale/9780231559430/\">fieldwork we present in our recent book</a> on the topic bears this out. Among South Asian practitioners, the common attitude is that women embody the maternal principle, and this makes them extremely powerful. In them, the energy of Kundalini operates naturally. Men, on the other hand, need to be purified by a woman through ritual in order to effectively engage in Kundalini practice.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman meditates in the forest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706117/original/file-20251203-56-unb996.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A woman meditates during festival for a modern, branded version of Kundalini yoga.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/forest-meditation-at-kundalini-yoga-festival-news-photo/169369091\">Godong/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Such ideas are also common among Western practitioners, who tend to believe women have a more natural aptitude for Kundalini awakening. One of our subjects said this is because women have less ego. Another attributed it to female sexual fluids.</p>\n\n<p>However, cultural difference plays a role, too. Western notions of the divine feminine are much more inclined to cling to the binary, resisting the idea that male and female bodies alike are ultimately woven from the same nondual reality.</p>\n\n<p>Most striking, perhaps, one man who had spent a lifetime among seekers at spiritual retreats in the U.S. and South America told us of a long-held and common belief that only women were capable of Kundalini experience. It was, to him, an energy exclusive to the female body. He recounted having been shocked, only months prior, at encountering a copy of the 1967 classic <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/kundalini-the-evolutionary-energy-in-man-gopi-krishna/page/n3/mode/2up\">“Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man</a>,” authored by the decidedly male Gopi Krishna.</p>\n\n<p>The broader point, however, is that the historical core of Kundalini practice has always been about transcending all dualities.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, even as a goddess representing the ultimate “She,” Kundalini is best understood as nonbinary. Perhaps if we can wrap our heads around this idea, we can cultivate a more inclusive empowerment.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263402/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Of the five SIMPLEx missions selected so far, three have failed after launch due to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/lunar-trailblazer/nasas-lunar-trailblazer-moon-mission-ends/\">equipment problems</a> that might have been caught in more traditional, tightly managed programs. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/janus/\">A fourth</a> sits in indefinite storage. </p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE will not begin returning science data for about 30 months, and the program’s history suggests the odds are not entirely in its favor. Nonetheless, the calculus goes that if enough of these missions are successful, NASA can achieve valuable science at a reduced cost – even with some losses along the way. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704634/original/file-20251125-56-ynheuz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two images showing the side of a solar panel.

They use thoroughly proven hardware and undergo exhaustive testing.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE is at the other end. It’s a class D mission, defined as having “high risk tolerance” and “medium to low complexity.”</p>\n\n<p>Of the <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250005285/downloads/Class%20D%20Technical%20Note_20250521A.pdf\">21 class D missions</a> that have launched since the designation was first applied in 2009, NASA has not had a single class D mission launch on schedule. Only four remained under budget. Four were canceled outright prior to launch.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE, which will have cost an estimated US$94.2 million by the end of its science operations in 2029, has stayed under the $100 million mark through a series of cost‑saving choices. It has a <a href=\"https://escapade.ssl.berkeley.edu/instruments/\">small set of key instruments</a>, a low spacecraft mass to reduce launch costs, and extensively uses generic commercial components instead of custom hardware.</p>\n\n<p>NASA also outsourced to private companies: Much of the spacecraft development went to <a href=\"https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/escapade/\">Rocket Lab</a> and the trajectory design to <a href=\"https://advancedspace.com/escapade/\">Advanced Space LLC</a>, with tight contract limits to make sure the contractors didn’t go over budget.</p>\n\n<p>Additional savings came from creative arrangements, including the university‑funded VISIONS camera package and a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-landed-its-booster-on-a-barge-at-sea-an-achievement-that-will-broaden-the-commercial-spaceflight-market-269786\">discounted ride on New Glenn</a>, which Blue Origin wanted to fly anyway for its own testing objectives.</p>\n\n<h2>Commercial space</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ESCAPADE launched at a moment of transition in space science. </p>\n\n<p>NASA and other science agencies are facing the <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts\">steepest budget pressures in more than 60 years</a>, with political winds <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-sets-the-stage-for-nasas-return-to-the-moon/\">shifting funding toward human spaceflight</a>. At the same time, the <a href=\"https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/news/drivers-of-the-space-economy/\">commercial space sector is booming</a>, with long-imagined technologies that enable cheap space travel finally entering service.</p>\n\n<p>That boom has, in part, led to a resurgence in NASA’s “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2022.101515\">faster, better, cheaper</a>” push that originated in the 1980s and ‘90s – and which largely faded after the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/19476-space-shuttle-columbia-disaster-oversight.html\">2003 Columbia disaster</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In theory, leaner NASA oversight, greater use of off‑the‑shelf hardware and narrower science goals can cut costs while launching more missions and increasing the total science return. If ESCAPADE succeeds in delivering important science, it will be held up as evidence that this more commercial, risk-tolerant template can deliver.</p>\n\n<h2>The trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/rookisaacman/status/1985796145017471442\">A concept</a> put forward by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-nomination-for-nasa-leader-boasts-business-and-commercial-spaceflight-experience-during-a-period-of-uncertainty-for-the-agency-254274\">Jared Isaacman</a>, the Trump administration’s nominee to lead NASA, is that 10 $100 million missions would be better than one $1 billion flagship – or top-tier – mission. This approach could encourage faster mission development and would diversify the types of missions heading out into the solar system. </p>\n\n<p>But that reorganization comes with trade-offs. For example, low‑cost missions rarely match flagship missions in scope, and they typically do less to advance the technology necessary for doing innovative science.</p>\n\n<p>With a narrow scope, missions like ESCAPADE are unlikely to produce the most transformative discoveries about, for instance, the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/search-for-life/beginnings-life-on-our-world-and-others/\">origins of life</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/mapping-dark-matter/\">nature of dark matter</a>, or the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/why-europa-ingredients-for-life/\">first chemical analyses of oceans on a new world</a>. Instead, they focus on more specific questions.</p>\n\n<p>Early in ESCAPADE’s development, my role was to help create a planning document for the VISIONS cameras called the Science Traceability Matrix, which defines an instrument’s scientific goals and translates them into concrete measurement requirements.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I systematically asked: What do we want to learn? What observations prove it? And, critically, how precisely does the instrument need to work to be “good enough,” given the budget? Loftier goals usually demand more complex instruments and operations, which drive up costs.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE’s broader goals are to create a clearer picture of Mars’ magnetic field, how the solar wind interacts with it, and figure out what that process does to Mars’ atmosphere. That is valuable science. But it is more modest than the $583 million predecessor mission <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/maven/\">MAVEN’s more extensive scope and richer suite of instruments</a>. It was MAVEN that determined how and when Mars lost its once-dense atmosphere in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>Both ESCAPADE and MAVEN are dwarfed again by the open‑ended potential of an operation like the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-can-the-james-webb-space-telescope-see-so-far-257421\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, which observes a limitless slate of astronomical objects in the infrared light spectrum with a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-we-sharpened-the-james-webb-telescopes-vision-from-a-million-kilometres-away-262510\">higher resolution</a> than any combination of prior smaller telescopes.</p>\n\n<p>Flagship missions like the James Webb Space Telescope push the state of the art in new technologies and materials. These innovations then <a href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/\">filter into both future missions and everyday life</a>. For example, the Webb telescope advanced the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/webb-jwst-spinoffs-v122011.pdf\">medical tools used in eye exams</a>. Smaller missions rely more heavily on existing, mature technologies. </p>\n\n<p>And when systems are built by private companies rather than NASA, those companies keep tight control over the patents rather than openly spreading the technology across the scientific community.</p>\n\n<h2>A tense road to launch</h2>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE’s principal investigator, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ON3sy2YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Rob Lillis</a>, has joked that it is the mission with 11 lives, having survived 11 near‑cancellations. Problems ranged from being late in reaching the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/\">technology readiness levels</a> that helped ensure the probes wouldn’t malfunction after launch, to the loss of its original free ride, with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nasas-psyche-asteroid-mission-a-3-6-billion-kilometre-journey-to-the-centre-of-the-earth-215707\">NASA’s Psyche mission</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, ESCAPADE received support from NASA to ride on New Glenn’s maiden flight, only to face delays as Blue Origin worked through <a href=\"https://payloadspace.com/new-glenn-debut-delayed-along-with-escapade-mars-mission/\">technical hurdles</a>. At last, in October 2025, ESCAPADE reached the launchpad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I traveled to Cape Canaveral for the launch and felt the tension firsthand. The first window was scrubbed by <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/blue-origin-delays-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket-carrying-nasa-mars-probes-may-seek-exemption-from-faa-order-for-next-try\">bad weather and issues with ground equipment</a>. Then a strong solar storm — ironically, a key driver of the very processes ESCAPADE will study — shut down the second window. </p>\n\n<p>Concurrently, the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/faa-restricts-commercial-rocket-launches-indefinitely-due-to-air-traffic-risks-from-government-shutdown\">Federal Aviation Administration imposed new launch restrictions</a> due to the government shutdown that would have postponed the launch further if not for a last-minute exemption. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, on Nov. 13, after repeated setbacks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvURVG_b10\">New Glenn lifted off to cheers</a> around the country. ESCAPADE reached orbit, and after a nervous few hours of receiver misalignment, mission controllers established communication with the spacecraft.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>While in Florida, I also watched another milestone in commercial spaceflight: the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-starlink-launch-group-6-87-jrti\">record-breaking 94th launch</a> from Cape Canaveral in 2025, marking the most launches from Florida in a single year.

Our research has found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15555240.2025.2541021\">76% of employees</a> want to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-allyship-a-brief-history-present-and-future-220668\">be allies</a> to co-workers who face additional challenges, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vt7bf_v3\">84% value equity</a>. That’s in line with a 2025 <a href=\"https://www.catalyst.org/insights/2025/risks-of-retreat-path-forward\">national survey</a> that found 88% of employees supported employers offering training on how to be more inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>So why doesn’t that support always turn into action?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15555240.2025.2541021\">Our new study</a> in the Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health points to one reason: Some people may freeze with worry because they feel like a fake. Specifically, they feel like they don’t have the skills to effectively support their marginalized co-workers, even though they want to. Those feelings may block action, which makes people feel even more fraudulent – creating a loop that’s hard to break.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we – <a href=\"https://cbe.wwu.edu/people/warren4\">Meg Warren</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.wwu.edu/michaelwarren/about/\">Michael T. Warren</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J87P7O4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">John LaVelle</a> – found that 1 in 5 people who want to support marginalized groups experience the impostor phenomenon even when they have the skills to be effective allies.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/job.2733\">impostor phenomenon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kateatkin.com/imposter/\">formerly called the “impostor syndrome,”</a> is the feeling that you’re not good enough – even when there’s objective evidence that you are. Researchers have documented it across many workplace and professional settings, including in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-025-02898-4\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3639475.3640114\">technology</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2019.05.001\">entrepreneurship</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kornferry.com/about-us/press/71percent-of-us-ceos-experience-imposter-syndrome-new-korn-ferry-research-finds\">the C-suite</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03634523.2024.2320757\">academia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, these feelings are linked to significantly higher anxiety and feelings of depression among people who want to be allies. We found that men, leaders, younger employees and people of color were more likely to experience the impostor phenomenon in the context of allyship.</p>\n\n<h2>What the impostor phenomenon looks like for allies</h2>\n\n<p>Consider “James,” a senior project manager. For the past few years, his company has expected all managers to undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training and to support the company’s Black Employee Network. Earlier this year, however, the company publicly withdrew its commitment to DEI and removed all mentions of it from its website. </p>\n\n<p>When his team asked for his thoughts, James felt lost. The facts he learned during the Black Employee Network meetings were unsettling and undeniable. Before, he regularly cited these during various meetings with his colleagues and senior leaders. Now, he felt pressured to act as if none of this mattered. He felt frustrated, at a loss for words and a complete fake – like he didn’t know how to support his colleagues anymore.</p>\n\n<p>While “James” is a composite character drawn from many stories we’ve heard over the course of our research, his experience captures the bind that many would-be allies face.</p>\n\n<p>When allies feel this way, they often compare themselves to an imagined “perfect ally,” thinking that if they can’t be outrageously heroic, they must be failures. They then deal with feelings of inadequacy by procrastinating or overpreparing before stepping up for others – to the point where they miss crucial opportunities where they could have made a difference.</p>\n\n<p>People tend to feel like an impostor when they encounter a challenge that seems bigger than their ability to cope with it. So it’s not surprising that a lot of people feel this way about workplace equity. Inequity and bias play out in complex ways in organizations: The rules change rapidly, and people can receive mixed messages about what behaviors are appropriate, valued and rewarded. This can make allyship feel overwhelmingly challenging, even for those who are otherwise skilled.</p>\n\n<p>Work culture also matters. In toxic organizational cultures or hypercompetitive environments, people feel pressure to hide their mistakes, they worry about colleagues sabotaging their efforts, and they see humility as a weakness. In such places – and especially when the would-be ally’s role is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063211020358\">highly visible and entails heavy responsibility</a> – people are vulnerable to impostor feelings.</p>\n\n<p>Past criticism can add fuel, too. If you’ve been admonished for standing up for a colleague or have seen others be attacked – including by those who wish to maintain an unjust status quo – you might further feel pressure to only act in ways that are immune to criticism. That’s an impossible standard.</p>\n\n<h2>Consequences of feeling like an impostor: Feeling worse, doing worse</h2>\n\n<p>Leaders in particular are vulnerable to feeling like impostors on allyship. Many haven’t been properly trained on how to listen to and support co-workers who might be facing discrimination and are quietly suffering, yet are held responsible for solving complex issues around fairness that long predated them. </p>\n\n<p>And when stuck in this uncomfortable space, people who feel like impostors are likely to become defensive and feel pressured to be a hero. To prove themselves, they may <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-00613-7\">overcompensate in ways that backfire</a> – for example, by loudly claiming support for disadvantaged workers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12724\">without following up with useful action</a>, or by swooping in to fix issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/19/no-more-white-saviours-thanks-how-to-be-a-true-anti-racist-ally\">without respecting the preferences of the people involved</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this not only affects their ability to be a supportive colleague, but it also likely harms their mental health. Indeed, the impostor phenomenon has been found to be linked to heightened anxiety and feelings of depression, both in our study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0000397-004\">and beyond</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So you might wonder: What if I opt out of all of this by not thinking about inequity at all? Our research suggests that this is a bad idea. People who are disengaged from issues of inequity, and who don’t invest in learning and growing as allies, experience lower self-confidence at work and have lower job satisfaction. Checking out of allyship could be bad for your professional well-being.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is you don’t have to be stuck feeling this way. You can take low-risk, bite-sized actions that can pull you out of feeling fake and boost your confidence, all while improving your own professional success <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721416686212\">and mental health</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-and-happier/202509/lead-inclusively-by-harnessing-the-power-of-joy\">Research points to</a> three simple ways forward. First, recognize and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-and-happier/202505/the-importance-of-loudly-celebrating-others-strengths\">loudly celebrate the strengths</a> of marginalized colleagues, which creates an uplifting work culture. Second, take concrete steps to build trust – for example, by <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-11504-001\">giving proper credit</a> to a disadvantaged colleague if their merit is wrongfully questioned. And finally, overcome your cynicism – which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1529798\">research shows</a> invariably suppresses constructive action – and instead adamantly choose hope, even when it’s hard.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271081/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Using consumer price indices for the main components of medical care – such as services provided in clinics and hospitals as well as administrative expenses – based on federal data and data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, we found that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.47462\">the cost of hospital services increased the most</a>, while the cost of physician services and prescription drugs rose more slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the premium increases can be attributed to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/outpatient-visits-are-increasingly-billed-at-higher-levels-implications-for-health-costs/\">hospital outpatient visits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/annual-family-premiums-for-employer-coverage-rise-6-in-2025-nearing-27000-with-workers-paying-6850-toward-premiums-out-of-their-paychecks/\">coverage of GLP-1 drugs</a>. But research, including our own, suggests that premiums have rapidly escalated mostly because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/forefront.20240906.397095\">health system consolidation</a> – when hospitals and other health care entities merge – has led hospitals to raise prices well above their costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Hospital CEOs prioritize profit</h2>\n\n<p>Hospitals are aggressively raising their prices because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000002198\">hospital CEOs have incentives to do so</a>. </p>\n\n<p>One study found that for nonprofit health systems, the greatest pay increases between 2012 and 2019 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000002198\">went to hospital CEOs</a> who grew the profits and size of their organizations the most. However, the financial reward of delivering above-average quality of care declined. Increased <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/hospital-charity-care-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters/\">charity care</a> – free or discounted health services nonprofit hospitals must provide some of their patients who cannot afford medical care – was not significantly tied to CEO compensation.</p>\n\n<p>Board members set performance criteria that determine the base salary and bonus payments for CEOs. Over half of board members at top U.S. hospitals have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08056-z\">professional backgrounds in finance or business</a>. As a result, researchers and advocates have raised concerns that financial success is the dominant priority at these institutions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of medical bill and credit cards\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706773/original/file-20251205-64-28us8x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Health care is getting more expensive for everyone.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/hospital-bill-royalty-free-image/1036961842\">DNY59/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One way to help ensure that nonprofit hospitals make the health of their local communities a top priority is to require their boards to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/answers/execcomp.htm#\">disclose their executive compensation guidelines</a> for salary and bonuses, similar to the information that for-profit health care companies disclose to their stockholders. The general public could pressure companies to put greater weight on affordability and quality of care when setting performance targets for nonprofit hospital executives.</p>\n\n<p>Some economists suggest that <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/policy-proposal/a-proposal-to-cap-provider-prices-and-price-growth-in-the-commercial-health-care-market/\">hospital prices be regulated</a>. This approach involves capping prices for health care services at the most expensive hospitals and restricting price growth for all hospitals.

Perhaps not; the fact-checking site Snopes <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/feast-of-friends/\">found no evidence</a> of the association even existing. But the joke’s popularity points to a tradition cherished by many American Jews – Chinese food on Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>But why would Jews, who do not celebrate Christmas, have Christmas traditions? </p>\n\n<p>Like many minority groups, Jews have always created ways of adapting to the societies in which they live, but whose culture they do not totally share. And one thing that means is a collection of Christmas traditions, varying by time and place. Many of them came up in interviews for my book “<a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469636368/beyond-chrismukkah/\">Beyond Chrismukkah: The Christian-Jewish Interfaith Family in the United States</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>Old World festivities</h2>\n\n<p>Long before Jews came to the United States, some of them celebrated Christmas – participating in many of the cultural traditions, even as they avoided the religious part of the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://newlehrhaus.org/instructor/jordan-chad\">Jordan Chad</a>, author of “<a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479840786/christmas-in-yiddish-tradition/\">Christmas in Yiddish Tradition</a>,” Jewish folklore about the holiday appears as early as the late 1300s. Plenty of Jewish communities in Europe spent Christmas Eve dancing and drinking, <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/nittel-nacht-the-jewish-christmas-eve/\">feasting and gambling</a> – as many of their Christian neighbors did, when those neighbors were not in church. </p>\n\n<p>Other scholars have argued that these traditions grew out of attempts to <a href=\"https://blog.nli.org.il/en/nittel_nacht/\">avoid studying Jewish religious texts</a> on a Christian holiday. But Chad demonstrates that, over centuries, those customs came to celebrate the revelry of the season – though not the birth of Jesus. </p>\n\n<p>Even in the 20th century, scholars such as <a href=\"https://people.clas.ufl.edu/yfeller/\">Yaniv Feller</a> have found, many middle- and upper-class German <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9780773557956-009\">Jews embraced a secular Christmas</a>, complete <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2019/december/christmas-trees-jewish-homes.html\">with a tree</a>, a traditional dinner and presents. After all, some of those Christmas traditions stem less from religion than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hanukkah-celebrations-have-changed-dramatically-but-the-same-is-true-of-christmas-215119\">folk traditions</a> and industrialization. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A blue light in the shape of a Star of David sits atop a small bit of greenery.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706531/original/file-20251204-56-8oki8k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some Jewish families decorate a ‘Hanukkah bush’ as a seasonal alternative to a Christmas tree.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/close-up-of-lighted-star-of-david-atop-a-chanukah-bush-san-news-photo/1196273537?adppopup=true\">Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Given that long history, Jewish Christmas traditions are not necessarily a sign of Americanization. </p>\n\n<p>That said, in the United States, Christmas is so culturally powerful – a day that almost everyone has off, and that the majority of Americans spend with their kith and kin – that many non-Christian immigrants <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/23/christmas-also-celebrated-by-many-non-christians/\">celebrate it in a secular way</a>, with family visits, Santa and a tree. They do not necessarily do the religious parts of the holiday, but they may well deck the halls. Certainly, my own Hindu relatives do. </p>\n\n<p>And many Jews celebrate Christmas <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/to-tree-or-not-to-tree-how-jewish-christian-families-navigate-the-december-dilemma-172840\">in some way</a> because they are part of interfaith families – whether their own immediate family or extended relatives with whom they spend the day. Today, estimates place the American Jewish interfaith marriage rate as high as 50%.</p>\n\n<h2>Kosher-style Chinese</h2>\n\n<p>For plenty of contemporary Jews, however, it is profoundly important not to celebrate a secular version of Christmas. Starting in the 1970s, in fact, when American Jews were particularly <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469636368/beyond-chrismukkah/\">worried about rising rates of interfaith marriage</a>, many of the rabbis willing to perform ceremonies for Jewish-Christian couples made them promise to not have a Christmas tree. This happened despite the fact that, at the time, many American Jews did have Christmas trees in their homes. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Jews do not want to deck the halls, though, many still have the day off. Meanwhile, their non-Jewish friends, families and co-workers are busy and much of the world is closed. And so many Jews have developed their own ways of marking the day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/25/573415894/why-do-jewish-people-eat-chinese-food-on-christmas\">The Chinese food tradition is particularly famous</a>. In fact, during Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan’s 2010 confirmation hearings, when Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham asked her where she had been on Christmas Day, she responded, “Like all Jews, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2010/06/kagan-i-spent-christmas-at-chinese-restaurant-027851\">I was probably at a Chinese restaurant</a>.” </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBlMmuuJpbI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Elena Kagan’s Senate confirmation hearings made mention of the famous tradition.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The first written mention of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas Day comes from 1935, when, according to The New York Times, a man named <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/26/archives/yule-stirs-chinese-to-aid-jewish-home-eng-shee-chuck-of-newark.html\">Eng Shee Chuck</a> brought chow mein and toys to a New Jersey Jewish orphanage. </p>\n\n<p>His generosity was probably not why Jews started going to Chinese restaurants on Christmas; it is more likely that they were already doing so. The two communities lived cheek by jowl in many American cities, where immigrants of different sorts ended up in the same neighborhoods. And Chinese food contains little dairy, meaning it rarely violated Jewish dietary laws against mixing milk and meat. </p>\n\n<p>Most Chinese cuisines do use pork and shrimp, which is forbidden by kosher laws. But many <a href=\"https://forward.com/culture/437007/jewish-christmas-chinese-food/\">Jewish customers were happy to make an exception</a>, especially if the forbidden food was tucked in a dumpling or otherwise out of sight – at least outside their own homes. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.mocanyc.org/event/moca-talks-shiyong-lu-kosher-chinese-food/\">new research by New York University graduate student Shiyong Lu</a> demonstrates, Chinese restaurants were also eager to cater to American Jews: They wanted to develop white, American clientele, and here were some right in their neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://wp.nyu.edu/artsampscience-cham/\">restaurant owners learned</a> that Jews often eschewed pork, some began to offer traditional dishes with chicken instead – allowing more observant Jews to eat “kosher style,” without eating explicitly forbidden food. Today, there is wide variation in Jewish dietary practices, making Chinese food even more accessible for most Jews.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photograph of two men in suit jackets and Jewish head coverings seated at a table with signs on the wall.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705931/original/file-20251202-56-312slg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=758&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two men enjoy Chinese cuisine, prepared under kosher guidelines, around 1960.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/two-men-enjoy-chinese-cuisine-prepared-by-chinese-chefs-news-photo/514694012?adppopup=true\">Bettmann via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By the end of the 20th century, “Chinese food and a movie” had become <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/24308969/jewish-christmas-chinese-food-restaurant-myth-rg-lounge-san-francisco\">the trope of Jewish Christmas</a>. Because most Chinese immigrants were not Christian, their restaurants are <a href=\"https://reformjudaism.org/reform-jewish-life/food-recipes/why-some-jews-eat-chinese-food-christmas\">often open on Dec. 25</a>. And indeed, they are often filled with Jews.</p>\n\n<h2>Movies, volunteering and more</h2>\n\n<p>The same tends to be true for movie theaters. In 2012, I saw “Les Misérables” on Christmas Day in a theater that seemed to be a who’s who of the Atlanta Jewish community. In fact, the movies and the Chinese food are often paired, whether out on the town or at home, streaming with take out.</p>\n\n<p>Jewish museums are often open and are another popular destination in cities that have them. And some Jews <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-12-17/traveling-on-christmas-day-what-you-need-to-know\">use Christmas Day for travel</a>. At least in eras past, plane tickets were notably cheaper than the days around the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Another Jewish Christmas tradition is simply to go to work, so as to let Christian colleagues have the day off. Many Jewish doctors and nurses are on call, or <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3921605/non-christian-doctors-volunteer-to-work-christmas/\">staff the emergency room</a> or the intensive care unit, so that their colleagues can be home. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in blue protective equipment enters a room off of a corridor with a Christmas tree decorated in red ribbon, homemade ornaments, and a medical mask.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705949/original/file-20251202-66-pnl8aj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Christmas tree is decorated with the pandemic in mind in the COVID-19 ICU at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Mass., in December 2020.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/christmas-tree-is-decorated-with-the-pandemic-in-mind-in-news-photo/1230274960?adppopup=true\">Craig F.

Fallon / AFP via Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to major U.S. industries, three tends to be the magic number.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, auto manufacturing was <a href=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/products/once-upon-a-car-bill-vlasic-9780061845635\">long dominated by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors</a> – the so-called “Big Three,” which at one point controlled over 60% of the U.S. auto market. A dominant trio shows up elsewhere, too, in everything from the <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297a/U.S.%20Defense%20Industry%20and%20Arms%20Sales.htm\">U.S. defense market</a> – think Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrup Grumman – to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/201048/total-operating-revenues-of-us-telecommunication-providers/#:%7E:text=Verizon%20had%20the%20highest%20total,%2C%20and%20T%2DMobile%20US.\">cellphone service providers</a> (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon). The same goes for the U.S. airline industry in which American, Delta and United fly higher than the rest.</p>\n\n<p>The rule of three also applies to what Americans watch; the glory days of television was <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/decline-big-three-networks\">dominated by three giants</a>: ABC, CBS and NBC.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in the digital age, we are rapidly moving to a “Big Three” dominating streaming services: Netflix, Amazon and Disney.</p>\n\n<p>The latest step in that process is Netflix’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-82-7-billion-deal-1236601034/\">plan to acquire Warner Bros.</a> for US$72 billion. If approved, the move would solidify Netflix as the dominant streaming platform. </p>\n\n<h2>When streams converge</h2>\n\n<p>Starting life as a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-history-killed-blockbuster-dominated-hollywood-1236342853/\">mail DVD subscription service</a>, Netflix <a href=\"https://qz.com/887010/netflix-nflx-launched-streaming-video-10-years-ago-and-changed-the-way-we-watch-everything\">moved into streaming movies and TV shows in 2007</a>, becoming a first-mover into the sphere.</p>\n\n<p>Being an early adopter as viewing went from cable and legacy to online and streaming gave Netflix an advantages in also developing support technology and using subscriber data to create new content. </p>\n\n<p>The subsequent impact was Netflix became a market leader, with quarterly <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-profit-report-netflix-disney-warners-paramount-nbcu-1235868631/\">profits now far exceeding its competitors</a>, which often report losses.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, even without the Warner Bros. acquisition, Netflix has a dominant global base of <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/ir-overview/profile/default.aspx\">over 300 million subscribers</a>. Amazon Prime comes second with <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/technology/amazon-introduces-new-time-saving-feature-customers-will-love\">roughly 220 million subscribers</a>, and Disney – which includes both Disney+ and Hulu – is third, with roughly <a href=\"https://senalnews.com/en/data/disney-nears-200-million-streaming-subscribers-amid-strategic-shift#:%7E:text=The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company%20closed,also%20contributed%20to%20this%20growth.\">196 million subscribers</a>. This means that between them, these three companies already <a href=\"https://evoca.tv/streaming-service-market-share/\">control over 60% of the streaming market</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s lead would only be reinforced by the proposed deal with Warner Bros., as it would add ownership of Warner subsidiary HBO Max, which is currently the fourth-biggest streamer in the U.S. with a <a href=\"https://cordcuttersnews.com/hbo-max-added-2-3-million-subscribers-globally-in-q3-2025/\">combined 128 million subscribers</a>. While some of them will overlap, Netflix is likely to still gain subscribers and better retain them with a broader selection of content.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"YKfD7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YKfD7/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s move to acquire Warner Bros. also follows prior entertainment industry consolidation, driven by a desire to control content to retain streaming service subscribers. </p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Disney <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/20/705009029/disney-officially-owns-21st-century-fox\">acquired 21st Century Fox</a> for $71.3 billion. Three years later, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/amazon-mgm-merger-close-1235207852/\">Amazon acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> for $8.5 billion. </p>\n\n<p>Should the Netflix deal go through, it would continue this trend of streaming consolidation. It would also leave a clear gap at the top between the emerging Big Three and other services, such as Paramount+ with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-subscribers-streaming-loss-1236211289\">79 million subscribers</a> and Apple TV+, which has <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-streaming-losses-1-billion-per-year-1236344052/\">around 45 million</a>. Paramount on Dec. 8, 2025, announced a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/paramount-makes-1084-billion-bid-warner-bros-discovery-2025-12-08/\">a proposed $108.4 billion deal</a> that would, unlike the Netflix plan, include Warner Bros. subsidiary Discovery+.</p>\n\n<h2>Why industries come in threes</h2>\n\n<p>But why do industries converge to a handful of companies?</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://business.fsu.edu/person/david-r-king\">expert on mergers</a>, I know the answer comes down to market forces relating to competition, which tends to drive consolidation of an industry into three to five firms. </p>\n\n<p>From a customer perspective, there is a need for multiple options. Having more than one option avoids monopolistic practices that can see prices fixed at a higher rate. Competition between more than one big player is also a strong incentive for additional innovation to improve a product or service. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, governments – in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-sites-worldwide\">the U.S. and over 100 other countries</a> – have antitrust laws and practices to avoid any industry displaying limited competition. </p>\n\n<p>However, as industries become more stable, growth tends to slow and remaining businesses are forced to compete over a largely fixed market. This can separate companies into industry leaders and laggards. While leaders enjoy greater stability and predictable profits, laggards struggle to remain profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Lagging companies often combine to increase their market share and reduce costs.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that consolidating industries quite often land on three main players as a source of stability – one or two risks falling into the pitfalls of monopolies and duopolies, while many more than three to five <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1807049?seq=3\">can struggle to be profitable in mature industries</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s ahead for the laggards</h2>\n\n<p>The long-term viability of companies outside the “Big Three” streamers is in doubt, as the main players get bigger and smaller companies are unable to offer as much content. </p>\n\n<p>A temporary solution for smaller streamers to gain subscribers is to offer teaser rates that later increase for people that forget to cancel until companies take more permanent steps. But lagging services will also face increased pressure to exit streaming by licensing content to the leading streaming services, cease operations or sell their services and content.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, companies outside the Big Three could be tempted to acquire smaller services in an attempt to maintain market share.</p>\n\n<p>There are already rumors that Paramount, which is a competing bidder for Warner Bros., may <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/paramount-plus-with-showtime-buy-starz-lionsgate-spinoff-1234809754/\">seek to acquire Starz</a> or create a joint venture with Universal, which owns Peacock. </p>\n\n<p>Apple shows no immediate plan of discontinuing Apple TV+, but that may be due to the company’s high profitability and an overall cash flow that limits pressures to end its streaming service.</p>\n\n<p>Still, if the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal completes, it will likely increase the valuation of other lagging streaming services due to increased scarcity of valuable content and subscribers. This is due to competitive limits that restrict the Big Three from getting bigger, making the combination of smaller streaming services more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>This is reinforced by shareholders expecting similar or greater premiums from prior deals, driving the need to pay higher prices for the fewer remaining available assets. </p>\n\n<h2>The cost to consumers</h2>\n\n<p>So what does this all mean for consumers? </p>\n\n<p>I believe that in general, consumers will largely not be impacted when it comes to the overall cost of entertainment, as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/affordability-2025-inflation-food-prices-housing-child-care-health-costs/\">inflationary pressures for food and housing</a> limit available income for streaming services.</p>\n\n<p>But where they access content will continue to shift away from cable television and movie theaters. </p>\n\n<p>Greater stability in the streaming industry through consolidation into a Big Three model only confirms the decline in traditional cable.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s rationale in acquiring Warner Bros. is likely to enable it to offer streaming at a lower price than the combined price of separate subscriptions, but more than Netflix alone.</p>\n\n<p>This could be achieved through additional subscription tiers for Netflix subscribers wanting to add HBO Max content. Beyond competition with other members of the “Big Three,” another reason why Netflix is unlikely to raise prices significantly is that it will likely commit to not doing so in order to get the merger approved.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix’s goal is to ensure it remains consumer’s first choice for streaming TV and films. So while streaming is fast becoming a Big Three industry, Netflix’s plan is to remain at the top of the triangle. </p>\n\n<p><em>This article was updated on Dec. 8, 2025, with news of Paramount’s hostile bid.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271466/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David R.

But for the Federal Reserve, the purpose of its monetary policy is mandated by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>This is widely known as the Federal Reserve’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm\">dual mandate</a>: promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed itself <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">refers to these two objectives regularly</a> in its Federal Open Market Committee statements announcing its monetary policy decisions. </p>\n\n<p>A third objective of monetary policy, however, is less well-known: moderate long-term interest rates. </p>\n\n<p>This “third mandate” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/fed-third-mandate-forces-bond-traders-to-rethink-age-old-rules\">was a big news story</a> in September 2025, when the Trump administration’s newly appointed Fed governor, Stephen Miran, referred to it <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/miran_testimony_9-4-25.pdf\">in his testimony</a> before the Senate Banking Committee. Financial markets <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/trump-fed-miran-third-mandate\">paid close attention</a> to this aspect of the testimony because the comments suggested that Miran and other presidential appointees may focus on this third mandate – and on driving down long-term borrowing costs – more than the Fed has in the recent past.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ujPNgoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I’ve been closely following</a> how the Fed conducts monetary policy for many years. Miran is correct that Congress has tasked the U.S. central bank with all three of these objectives – but that’s not the whole story. In fact, none of these goals were originally spelled out in the act that set up the Fed over a century ago.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Fed’s goals have been revised several times – typically in response to a crisis.</p>\n\n<h2>The Fed’s shifting goals</h2>\n\n<p>The original purpose of the Fed, as explained in the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm\">Federal Reserve Act of 1913</a>, was to provide flexibility in the nation’s currency supply and to supervise the U.S. banking system. The current dual mandate was not part of the original goals of the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, its <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/feds-formative-years\">core goal was to reduce</a> the frequent banking panics that were costly to the economy and sharply increased interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>The first big change in the goals, in response to the Great Depression, was the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/employment-act-of-1946\">Employment Act of 1946</a> that stated the goal of federal government policy – and, therefore that of the Fed – is to “promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power.” </p>\n\n<p>This is where the two goals of the dual mandate first began to emerge, with purchasing power implying the Fed needed to keep inflation low.</p>\n\n<p>Following the macroeconomic instability of the 1970s with high unemployment and high inflation, Congress enacted the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed-reform-act-of-1977#footnote1\">Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977</a> that formalized the Fed mandate: “maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” </p>\n\n<p>In other words, Congress gave the Fed three mandates to follow in monetary policy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a white man wearing suit and glasses and without hair sits before a table with a microphone in a crowded room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706517/original/file-20251204-56-6owbvb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stephen Miran mentioned the third mandate during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in September 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/SenateFederalReserve/2894c5957bc2451a9ba5ba4f4d0c1f7a/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What happened to the third mandate?</h2>\n\n<p>So why doesn’t the Fed still talk about that third mandate?</p>\n\n<p>Part of the answer is that moderate long-term interest rates <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/feds-powell-explains-how-central-bank-moderate-rates-mandate-works-2025-09-17/\">are a natural by-product</a> of successfully managing the other two. </p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of low inflation and maximum employment, the Fed primarily uses a short-term interest rate, known as the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS/\">Federal Funds rate</a>. When journalists report that the Fed raised or lowered interest rates, this refers to the so-called target rate that the central bank uses to control the Fed Funds rate. For example, the current target rate is a range of 3.75% to 4%, while the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\">effective Fed Funds rate is 3.89%</a>. Banks use the funds rate as the cost other banks must pay to borrow reserve funds for one day. </p>\n\n<p>However, most of the interest rates that matter to people, businesses and the economy at large have much longer terms – such as five, 10 or 30 years. Examples include mortgages, car loans and corporate bonds. The Fed does not directly control these longer-term interest rates, which are set by financial markets.  </p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(01)00055-1\">studies have found</a> that the Fed’s policy decisions <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(89)90025-1\">can influence long-term rates</a>, primarily due to “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/evidence-uncovered-long-term-interest-rates-monetary-policy-and-the-expectations-theory.htm\">expectations theory</a>.” That theory argues that long-term rates reflect financial markets’ expectations of future short-term rates.</p>\n\n<p>So if markets believe the Fed has inflation under control, they tend to keep long-term rates on mortgages and everything else low because they don’t expect the Fed will increase its target rate. If inflation is running high, long-term rates tend to rise because markets expect the Fed to have to lift its short-term rate to deal with it. But if unemployment is running high, long-term rates tend to fall because markets expect the Fed to reduce its short-term rate to deal with that.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term rates are, therefore, not independent of the dual mandate of the Fed. They are often an outcome of how successfully the Fed is meeting the dual mandate of full employment and stable prices currently and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Fed doesn’t typically talk about this third mandate. </p>\n\n<h2>Promoting economic stability</h2>\n\n<p>That said, the Fed has, at times, although very rarely, influenced long-term rates directly.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in late 2010, following the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath\">Great Recession of 2007-2009</a>, the Fed purchased billions of dollars’ worth of long-term Treasury bonds and other securities – a program known as “QE2” for quantitative easing – in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed did something similar in 1961 with <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2011/04/operation-twist-effect-large-scale-asset-purchases/\">Operation Twist</a>, similarly with an aim to support the U.S. economy by reducing long-term borrowing costs. </p>\n\n<p>But even this phase of quantitative easing was primarily about meeting the Fed’s dual mandate. More specifically, since inflation was already low, the Fed was trying to boost hiring in the wake of the Great Recession.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed is keenly aware that longer-term interest rates that are not aligned with its dual mandate can be an important source of instability in the economy. A modern central bank’s primary goal is to promote stability in the economy, so longer-term interest rates should be at levels that are appropriate to ensure current and future economic stability.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268052/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Arabinda Basistha does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Yet at various points in the book, you call them a “rebrand,” a “public relations facade” and “immigration enforcement assistance with an immigrant friendly face.” What’s behind those characterizations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There’s an internal tension to sanctuary policies. There’s this broader sanctuary movement that’s been around since roughly 1980, which came about largely in response <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sanctuary-cities-in-the-us-were-born-in-the-1980s-as-central-american-refugees-fled-civil-wars-257718\">to U.S. involvement in Central American civil wars</a> and protecting immigrants fleeing these and other conflicts. </p>\n\n<p>The activists started working with city officials sympathetic to their cause in cities such as San Francisco to create resolutions protecting immigrants that were largely symbolic. After the San Francisco Police Department was found to be ignoring the resolution, the city created the country’s <a href=\"https://wwwtest.progov21.org/Home/Document/E26L81\">first sanctuary ordinance in 1989</a>. With this ordinance, activists hoped that local police could be prevented from collaborating with federal immigration officers. </p>\n\n<p>But many activists assumed that the kind of ethics and the values that existed in the sanctuary movement could actually be taken up in policy and implemented, because there’s this notion that when you pass a law or ordinance it will be implemented as written. </p>\n\n<p>A major part of the book is to say, “Actually, that’s not how policy works.” It fits within these bureaucratic cultures. And in policing culture, there’s already this web of relationships that local cops have with federal agents, and these cultures have their own value systems. Something that people don’t really talk about is that local police aren’t just used by ICE as these local enforcers of immigration law. In fact, a lot of times local law enforcement look to ICE as partners and collaborators. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1924502816237801857&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where does the breakdown happen between policy and practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p>These current policies largely acknowledge the fact that the majority of the undocumented people that local law enforcement encounter don’t have criminal backgrounds. They say that what we want to target are these really terrible people who are the violent criminals.</p>\n\n<p>These criminals are framed as the exception to the rule. But these exceptions still end up leading to quite a few people being transferred by local police and jails to ICE. And the exceptions can easily be exploited or broadened by the boots on the ground – the police tasked with following the policy – because there’s often this gray area in the language.</p>\n\n<p>So what ends up happening is that there really isn’t any sort of major decrease in deportations in sanctuary jurisdictions. In 2018, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal issued his <a href=\"https://www.njoag.gov/trust/\">Immigrant Trust Directive</a>, which barred local law enforcement from helping federal authorities carry out civil-immigration enforcement. The last year before it was implemented, local police turned 1,000 people being held in local jails over to ICE. After it went into effect, that number went down slightly the following year, to 700 people. That’s still a lot of undocumented people being turned over. And it’s because local police were able to apply those “exceptional circumstances” in many of those cases.</p>\n\n<p>In Trump 2.0, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/65-people-taken-ice-had-no-convictions-93-no-violent-convictions\">roughly two-thirds of immigrants in the custody of ICE</a> have no criminal background. During the Biden administration, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/03/texas-trump-immigration-crackdown-ice-arrests-deportation/\">42% of them had no criminal background</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the book, you relay this one instance in New Jersey where ICE calls in the local police as backup, and the local police – aware of the state’s new Immigrant Trust Directive – describe their role on the scene to local activists and passersby as “protecting public safety.” Yet you point out that they actually are helping ICE, because their cars are parked to block the street so the targeted immigrant can’t drive away.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can have a policy, <a href=\"https://cd4.lacity.gov/press-releases/city-council-votes-to-establish-los-angeles-as-a-sanctuary-city/\">like the one that the Los Angeles City Council passed in 2024</a>, which was basically written as a “no cooperation policy.” And still, it’s not possible to actually pull off in practice, because you then have those cases like the one you just mentioned, where even if you ban “immigration enforcement practices” like making immigration-related arrests, basic public safety policing is going to still happen, whether that’s crowd control or traffic control. </p>\n\n<p>So when local police show up at an immigration home arrest or a worksite raid, they often become part of immigration enforcement by virtue of the fact that they’re there to protect pedestrians, route traffic, respond to violence or protect ICE agents. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll see this on social media, when protests rapidly form to surround ICE officers during raids. Police step in to assist ICE by protecting them as they haul someone away. This turns emergency assistance and crowd control into a form of immigration enforcement itself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Uniformed police officers push back a crowd of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705933/original/file-20251202-56-m24yam.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">NYPD officers respond as protestors block a garage used by ICE vans ahead of a purported ICE raid on New York City’s Canal Street on Nov. 29, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/responds-as-immigration-activists-block-a-garage-used-by-news-photo/2248488235?adppopup=true\">Stephanie Keith/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Ultimately, when you get down into the procedural level of how you implement this stuff, it’s actually not possible to avoid cooperating. Complete non-cooperation and complete protection simply do not happen.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also seen local law enforcement agencies in sanctuary jurisdictions simply post all of their inmate information online. ICE agents can routinely check those databases and show up to arrest them once the inmates are released.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Under the George W. Bush administration, there was <a href=\"https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/miles/securecommunities\">the Secure Community program</a>, in which the Department of Homeland Security required local police to check the immigration status of anyone that they fingerprint. The Obama administration actually expanded this program. How have programs like this facilitated what you describe as a “professional kinship” between local police and federal agents?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, local police and federal agencies have different missions and different objectives, but they see themselves as being able to help each other accomplish their various goals.</p>\n\n<p>Many local police departments have long seen deportations as just another tool that they can use to get criminals off the street for good. Once they’ve arrested an undocumented person, they assume that if they’re deported, there won’t be an opportunity for them to return to the community to commit more crimes. And this view has been ingrained and reinforced through these collaborative partnerships like the Secure Communities program.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1982753636045443416&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, during the height of the Secure Communities program, (legal scholars) Adam Cox and Thomas Miles <a href=\"https://its.law.nyu.edu/faculty/profiles/representiveFiles/does_immigration_enforcement_reduce_crime_082514_94242D7E-F712-063A-64352391880DABF8.pdf\">conducted a statistical analysis</a> of 3,000 counties from 2005 to 2013 that assisted ICE by turning people over to them from local jails. </p>\n\n<p>They found, across the board, that crime in these counties didn’t decrease. It sounds counterintuitive. But when most people deported through jail transfers are people with low-level jail bookings – and not serious convictions – it makes more sense. It also doesn’t stop people who are part of a criminal enterprise from figuring out a way to get back into the country after being deported.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I want to go back to that term “sanctuary.” Opponents of sanctuary policies seem to have used it as a cudgel, and I think that’s because the layperson understands “sanctuary” as total protection. You obviously show that not to be the case. Have you seen elected officials avoiding the term?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around 2011 or 2012, officials started walking back the way they framed sanctuary policies. They were clearly sanctuary policies in terms of how they’d been crafted and what they attempt to do. But places like Chicago, for example, called theirs a “<a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/july_2012/mayor_emanuel_introduceswelcomingcityordinance.html\">Welcoming City” ordinance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These new terms emerged largely due to attacks by right-wing outlets such as Fox News and Breitbart. There was just a lot of bad press.</p>\n\n<p>And, yeah, politicians are running away from the term: I’ve heard different ones say, you know, “<a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2025/08/26/doj-letters-colorado-denver-immigration-policies/\">This is not a sanctuary policy</a>,” even though it’s been crafted using almost the exact same language as policies that are explicitly described as sanctuary policies.</p>\n\n<p>As I noted earlier, there was a time when activists and lawmakers thought these policies really were going to stop local jails and local police from helping to deport people. They just didn’t anticipate the durability of local-federal partnerships and their tenacity in finding ways to circumvent the intentions of lawmakers. </p>\n\n<p>I think over time – as the spirit of these policies continues to be violated by many local law enforcement officers – the term “sanctuary” has been used in more of an aspirational sense. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do local officers ever get disciplined for violating sanctuary policy?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/28-3-Mancina.pdf\">I actually studied this</a> – separate from the book – in San Francisco, where the police chief had issued a sanctuary city order. </p>\n\n<p>If an officer violates a local department order, it can go in their police file. These write-ups can add up and can lead to an actual firing under police union rules. </p>\n\n<p>In every single case where there was a violation of the sanctuary rules, the only thing that was issued was a verbal admonishment. So no write-ups. It’s the equivalent of someone saying, “Don’t do that again,” and leaving it at that.</p>\n\n<p>They knew their superiors were aware. So it was not nothing. In certain circumstances, those who had violated the order were told to go back to the San Francisco Police Academy for training on the sanctuary ordinance. </p>\n\n<p>But none of it went into their files. You could say it was a very lenient culture around those rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Returning to New Jersey: Was there any follow-up on whether local police departments were adhering to the Immigrant Trust Directive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So when the trust directive was implemented, the New Jersey attorney general’s office created training for all law enforcement officers. It was an online video that they had to watch. It was a few hours long. It was very technical. I watched it. Though some officers were allowed to do other work while watching, they all had to do it, and there was a very firm accounting of ensuring that every officer got that training.</p>\n\n<p>I also know that in the first year, they required local agencies to report back any instances of cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But after that first year, the follow-up seems to have stopped altogether. There were no further documented reports.</p>\n\n<p>I also managed a team of researchers that did a public records request of over 400 agencies across the state. I wanted to see whether local police departments had changed their policies to include the dictates of the Immigration Trust Directive. </p>\n\n<p>I was able to get access to records from 68% of all law enforcement agencies in the state. Of those, only 55% had actually changed their procedures so they were compliant with the Immigrant Trust Directive. Keep in mind, there were still pro-immigration enforcement procedures that were already on the books from Anne Milgram’s tenure (New Jersey’s attorney general from 2007 to 2010), when officers were encouraged to inquire about immigration status. It turns out many departments didn’t even tweak these internal policies and procedures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has stood out to you about the deportation efforts of the second Trump administration?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What’s happening are extensions of what’s been happening over the past few decades, in terms of the federal government looking to partner with different agencies at the local, state and federal levels, whether it’s sheriff’s departments, the ATF, the FBI or the Secret Service.</p>\n\n<p>But none of this coordination has ever happened to the degree we’re seeing right now. The administration is assigning people within these various agencies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/us/politics/dhs-agents-reassigned.html\">to do full-time immigration enforcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What’s been really amazing to me, too, has been the amplification of the 287(g) program. These are agreements signed with the Department of Homeland Security that permits local police officers to go out and find undocumented people to arrest and be potentially deported in the course of their everyday policing activities. So it allows them to double as a federal officer. </p>\n\n<p>At the start of 2025, <a href=\"https://lia-michigan.org/blog/police-and-immigration-enforcement/\">135 local law enforcement agencies</a> throughout the U.S. had signed these agreements. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/17/dhs-287g-reaches-more-1000-partnerships-state-and-local-enforcement-help-remove?\">Now over 1,000 agencies have signed on</a>. <a href=\"https://flsheriffs.org/blog/entry/florida-sheriffs-association-announces-287g-compliance-in-all-county-jails/\">Every single sheriff’s office in Florida</a> is currently under a 287(g) agreement. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Over the course of your 15 years studying sanctuary policing – either for this book or for your other studies – did you ever encounter instances where local police arrived at the scene of an ICE raid or an arrest and took the side of undocumented immigrants or citizens for one reason or another, whether that meant admonishing ICE agents for their aggressiveness or telling them, “Hey, you’re not following proper protocol.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, not a single time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269245/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n",

They use a variety of coercion and control techniques such as emotional abuse, <a href=\"https://cssh.northeastern.edu/crj/understanding-the-scope-and-nature-of-forced-criminality-in-the-united-states/\">forced criminality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/14/7/398\">financial abuse</a>, and physical and sexual abuse to entrap their victims. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the perpetrators are making money off their victims’ unpaid labor, including unwanted sex work. Human trafficking is estimated to be a <a href=\"https://ourrescue.org/resources/sex-trafficking/human-trafficking/human-trafficking-statistics/economics-of-human-trafficking\">US$172 billion industry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The story of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> is just one example of how traffickers use a combination of <a href=\"https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/force-fraud-and-coercion/\">manipulation, economic dependency and coercion</a> – rather than <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/human-trafficking-quick-facts\">physical captivity</a> – to entrap vulnerable people and slowly erode their autonomy. Many victims don’t even realize they’re being exploited due to the manipulations of their traffickers.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein’s crimes have attracted the national spotlight due to the fame and power of his clientele. His case demonstrates the harsh reality that human trafficking is far more common and complex than most people imagine.</p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SpCDf0IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">criminologists</a> who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Df9C-DwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">research human trafficking</a>. In 2020, we founded the University of South Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/cbcs/criminology/tip-lab/\">Trafficking in Persons Risk to Resilience Lab</a>, known as the TIP lab, to study human trafficking in the state of Florida.</p>\n\n<p>We know that labor and sex trafficking <a href=\"https://inourbackyard.org/the-issue/what-is-human-trafficking/\">hide in plain sight</a>, embedded in ordinary <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19389655231209698?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.7\">settings such as hotels</a>, <a href=\"https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/human-trafficking/recognizing-signs\">restaurants, farms, massage businesses</a> and private homes.</p>\n\n<p>Most victims are <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/the-misconceptions-of-child-trafficking/\">trafficked by someone they know or trust</a> – a family member, intimate partner or employer. Many continue to go to school or work <a href=\"https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/human-trafficking-americas-schools\">while being exploited</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Misconceptions about what trafficking looks like have made it harder to see and <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/human-trafficking-need-better-data\">harder to measure</a>. The available data on this crime and its victims has long been fragmented, incomplete and inconsistent. Law enforcement, government organizations such as health departments, and nonprofits that provide advocacy and victim services collect information differently. The same case could be counted multiple times by different agencies, while other victims go entirely uncounted, making it nearly impossible to understand the true scope of trafficking and effectively fight it.</p>\n\n<h2>Florida steps up</h2>\n\n<p>To address this problem, Florida in 2023 passed <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7064\">Senate Bill 7064</a>, a law requiring all state and local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations that receive federal or state funding to <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2023/governor-signs-bill-making-usf-trafficking-in-persons-lab-state-repository-for-human-trafficking-data.aspx\">send their human trafficking data</a> to the USF TIP lab.</p>\n\n<p>We developed TIPSTR, Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.usftiplab.org/statewide-data-repository/\">statewide repository for anonymous human trafficking data</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2025/usf-research-lab-releases-groundbreaking-report-on-the-high-prevalence-of-human-trafficking-in-florida.aspx\">single, consistent database</a> is the most comprehensive data resource on human trafficking in any state in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Our team compiled anonymous data from more than 30 state agencies and nonprofit organizations, including the <a href=\"https://www.myflfamilies.com/\">Florida Department of Children and Families</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/\">Florida Department of Law Enforcement</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.crisiscenter.com/\">Crisis Center of Tampa Bay</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We also conducted a self-report survey in 2024 to learn more about trafficking victims living in Florida. The survey was administered by <a href=\"https://yougov.com/en-us\">YouGov</a> using a representative sample of 2,500 Florida residents. And we established <a href=\"https://navigatewithbright.org/\">BRIGHT – Bridging Resources and Information Gaps in Human Trafficking</a> – which connects survivors directly with services such as housing, mental health counseling, transportation and more, helping them move from crisis to stability. Besides serving as a resource for trafficking victims, BRIGHT allows us to measure and track the availability of victim services relative to the need for them.</p>\n\n<p>Since starting TIPSTR in 2023, we’ve been putting all of the data together to create a picture of the complexities, depth and breadth of trafficking, as well as the resources that address the problem, both statewide and in each of Florida’s 67 counties.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man carries a bucket of tomatoes on his shoulders\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=407&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705970/original/file-20251202-56-pav23j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=511&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Florida’s agricultural industry attracts many migrant workers, who are vulnerable to being exploited.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/farm-labourer-carrying-bucket-of-tomatoes-on-royalty-free-image/981720-001?phrase=people%20walking%20in%20florida&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Wayne Eastep/The Image Bank via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why Florida faces higher risk</h2>\n\n<p>Florida’s economy and geography create a mix of risk factors for trafficking that are distinct from most other states.</p>\n\n<p>With its large <a href=\"https://www.mysuncoast.com/2025/11/26/florida-tourism-generated-1336-billion-2024-according-new-study/\">tourism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dolmanlaw.com/blog/human-trafficking-agriculture/\">agriculture</a>, <a href=\"https://researchhub.wttc.org/product/preventing-human-trafficking\">construction and entertainment industries</a>, the state depends heavily on <a href=\"https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking-on-temporary-work-visas-a-data-analysis-2015-2017/\">temporary and mobile workforces</a>. Its international airports and seaports connect it to global markets. Large sporting events and other entertainment bring in visitors looking for “fun in the sun” from all over the U.S. and the world.</p>\n\n<p>All of these features make Florida economically vibrant – <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/19190896/Human_Trafficking_in_Florida_The_Role_of_Applied_Anthropology_in_Addressing_the_Problem_and_Response\">but they also create vulnerabilities</a>. <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasp/resources/trafficking/dols-approach\">Transient labor markets, seasonal employment and high migration</a> make it easier for traffickers to exploit workers and harder for authorities to detect exploitation. Often, buyers travel into Florida as tourists with the idea that “what happens in Florida stays in Florida,” creating a market for sex trafficking.</p>\n\n<h2>What we’ve found so far</h2>\n\n<p>2024 was the first full year for which we collected data, and we published our findings in July 2025 in the <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3997/compressed_2024_TIPSTR_STATE_REPORT_ON_HUMAN_TRAFFICKING.pdf?1764019233\">2024 TIPSTR Report</a>. The report demonstrates both the scale of the problem and the importance of reliable data.</p>\n\n<p>The report also analyzes Florida counties with populations above 500,000, evaluating each county’s risk, resilience and response capacity on a scale from low to high.</p>\n\n<p>Our self-report survey found that an estimated 500,000 current Florida residents were exploited or trafficked at work, and an estimated 200,000 were trafficked for sex. Minors made up half of those trafficked for sex and a quarter of those exploited at work. Although many of these survivors were exploited outside of Florida, these people need services locally to help get their lives on track.</p>\n\n<p>Of those reporting human trafficking, only 9% to 12% reported this crime to law enforcement, confirming our concerns that it remains largely hidden from view. This is why it’s critical that TIPSTR doesn’t solely rely on law enforcement data.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis of the available data revealed wide variation across Florida counties in both the level of risk and the robustness of response systems. Some regions show strong resilience due to coordinated task forces and survivor services, while others struggle with underreporting and limited resources.</p>\n\n<h2>Translating data into action</h2>\n\n<p>At the same time, there are encouraging signs. The TIPSTR data shows prosecutions are increasing, and coordination among law enforcement, service providers and community organizations has strengthened.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, we hope our analysis of the data collected by TIPSTR will help the reporting agencies find new ways to respond. And tracking trends can allow policymakers to measure the effectiveness of programs run by different groups.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, this is already happening. One sheriff’s office shared with us that when it saw how many illicit massage businesses were in its county, it started investigating them. In another instance, a nonprofit told us it had used the report to show why it needs more funding to expand its programs.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing where trafficking is most concentrated and where services are missing is already helping the <a href=\"https://stophtfl.com/\">Florida Legislative Working Group on Human Trafficking</a> identify potential policy changes.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement can now use TIPSTR’s cross-agency data to connect cases. Service providers can coordinate care across counties, reducing duplication and ensuring continuity for survivors.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that the report will also be used to develop broader awareness campaigns and better victim identification practices.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of a long-term database</h2>\n\n<p>The system we’ve created will allow us to track the data for years to come. From a research perspective, this is critical, because it means our team can assess whether new policies and prevention strategies are making a measurable impact over time.</p>\n\n<p>As criminologists, we believe that what Florida has built through TIPSTR can serve as a model for other states. Data alone cannot end human trafficking, but without it, we are fighting a hidden problem we cannot fully see.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265935/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shelly M.

Across time, they also reveal the values each era chose to honor.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510318122\">study published in the journal</a> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we analyzed 38 million obituaries of Americans published from 1998 to 2024. We identified the values families most often highlight, and how those values shift across generations, regions and major historical events.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, working with psychologists <a href=\"https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/psychology-neuroscience/people/faculty-directory/liane-young.html\">Liane Young</a> and <a href=\"https://moralitylab.bc.edu/people/alumni/thomas-mazzuchi/\">Thomas Mazzuchi</a>, we examined the language used on <a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/\">Legacy.com</a>, an online platform where families often post obituaries and share memories of loved ones. </p>\n\n<p>During their lifetime, most people tend to be guided by a <a href=\"https://i2insights.org/2022/05/10/schwartz-theory-of-basic-values/\">small set of broad values</a> like caring for others, honoring tradition, keeping loved ones safe and seeking personal growth. To understand how these values showed up in remembrance, we used <a href=\"https://www.liwc.app/\">text-analysis tools</a> built on curated lists of everyday words people use when talking about those themes. </p>\n\n<p>By analyzing the words that appeared again and again in memorials, we could see which values communities chose to emphasize when looking back on the lives of their loved ones, and how those patterns changed over time. Because the dataset included 38 million obituaries, the analysis ran on a supercomputer. </p>\n\n<p>Across nearly 30 years of obituaries, words related to the value “tradition” appeared most often – many tributes described religious participation and enduring customs. Words related to the value “benevolence” – caring for the welfare of others – were also consistently prominent. In fact, tradition and benevolence formed the dominant value profile across the dataset: They appeared in more than 70% of the obituaries. By contrast, words related to values like “achievement” and “power” appeared far less often.</p>\n\n<p>Historical events did leave a mark. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the language families used to remember loved ones shifted compared with the period just before the attacks – and those shifts persisted for at least a year. Words related to the value “security” – including terms like “surviving,” “health” and “order” – showed up less often. At the same time, families used more language related to values like “benevolence” and “tradition.” Terms like “caring,” “loyal” and “service” showed up more often. These changes were especially strong in New York, where the attacks had the most direct impact. </p>\n\n<p>COVID-19, however, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.2510318122/asset/cdd39622-5240-4b1e-850b-a395268f6ac1/assets/images/large/pnas.2510318122fig05.jpg\">produced the most dramatic shifts</a>. Beginning in March 2020, benevolence-related language – including terms like “love,” “sympathy” and “family” – declined sharply, and hasn’t been the same since. Tradition-related language – terms like “service,” “faith” and “heritage” – initially declined as well, then rose above baseline levels during later stages of the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>These changes show that collective disruptions impact the moral vocabulary families use when commemorating loved ones. They shift what it means to have lived a good life.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw differences that reflect stereotypes about gender and age. Obituaries for men contained more language linked to achievement, conformity and power. Meanwhile, obituaries for women contained more language associated with benevolence and enjoying life’s pleasures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An elderly woman works on a laptop, looking grim, with a bouquet of flowers behind it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=599&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705404/original/file-20251130-56-f8dmy9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">There are notable differences in the values highlighted in obituaries of older versus younger adults.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/senior-woman-working-on-a-portable-computer-royalty-free-image/185248200?phrase=%20online%20obituary&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">AWelshLad/iStock / Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Older adults were often remembered more for valuing tradition. Younger adults, on the other hand, were often remembered more for valuing the welfare of all people and nature, and for being motivated to think and act independently. Value patterns in men’s obituaries shifted more across the lifespan than those in women’s. In other words, the values highlighted in younger and older men’s obituaries differed more from each other, while women’s value profiles stayed relatively consistent across age.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nna.org/obituaries-are-big-news-but-you-wouldnt-know-that-from-newspapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">The most visited</a> parts of print newspapers and online memorial sites, obituaries offer a window into what societies value at different points in time.</p>\n\n<p>This study contributes to the broader <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2022.101005\">scientific understanding of legacy</a>. People often hold strong preferences about how they want to be remembered, but far less is known about how they actually are remembered, in part because large-scale evidence about real memorials is rare. Our analysis of millions of obituaries helps fill that gap. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Obituaries allow researchers to trace cultural values across time, geography and social groups. Future work can examine differences across race and occupation, as well as across regions. It could also look to earlier periods using historical obituary archives, such as those preserved in older newspapers and local records.</p>\n\n<p>Another direction is to examine whether highlighting how often kindness shows up in obituaries could inspire people to be more caring in daily life.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what endures in memory helps clarify what people consider meaningful; those values shape how they choose to live.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263880/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This is the flagship designation of the National Park Service system, which includes many types of properties in addition to formally designated national parks.</p>\n\n<p>Although this <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2025/12/national-park-subcommittee-to-receive-testimony-on-pending-legislation\">redesignation</a> may not include much change for the site itself, it could mean quite a lot to visitors, supporters and locals alike.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/news/acquisition-more-than-doubles-the-size-of-ocmulgee-mounds-national-historical-park.htm\">3,000-acre park</a> protects land and features important to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/historyculture/mississippian-culture.htm\">Mississippian culture</a>, which built the mounds there starting roughly 3,000 years ago, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, for which the site is an ancestral homeland.</p>\n\n<p>The site includes <a href=\"https://traveltheparks.com/journey-through-time-ocmulgee-mounds/\">seven enormous ceremonial and burial mounds made of earth</a>, the largest of which is 55 feet (15 meters) tall and covers about 2 acres, as well as a museum containing <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/ocmulgee-mounds-national-historical-park\">millions of cultural artifacts</a>, including pottery, stone tools, jewelry and bells.</p>\n\n<p>The National Park Service has <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/management/upload/OCMU_FD_2014_508.pdf\">managed the site since the 1930s</a>, first as a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/archeology/national-monument-facts-and-figures.htm\">national monument</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/47/text\">since 2019</a>, as a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">national historical park</a>. There are no legal or practical differences in protection between these redesignations, though the branding and marketing of the site may change.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/sethkannarr/\">geographer</a> who studies parks and the naming of places, I have seen that when a National Park Service unit is redesignated as a national park, as a pending <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2345\">bill in Congress currently proposes</a> for Ocmulgee Mounds, it does not typically change the funding available to run the site. That’s especially true at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/28/us-national-parks-trumps\">National Park Service funding and personnel are being cut</a>. However, a park redesignation does serve political purposes and affects how visitors perceive that park.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26609838/embed\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26609838/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/26609838\" target=\"_top\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\"> </a></div>\n\n<h2>How parks are designated</h2>\n\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm\">manages 433 units</a> with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">19 different designations</a>, such as “national battlefields,” “national lakeshores” and “national scenic trails.” Only <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm\">63 of these units</a> carry the formal title or designation of “national park.”</p>\n\n<p>All but one of these categories can be bestowed only by Congress. National monuments, however, can be created by the president directly, under the provisions of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/national-monuments-have-grown-and-shrunk-under-us-presidents-for-over-a-century-thanks-to-one-law-the-antiquities-act-252707\">Antiquities Act of 1906</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Antiquities Act allowed President Barack Obama to designate 1.3 million acres in Utah as <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/28/proclamation-establishment-bears-ears-national-monument\">Bears Ears National Monument</a> in a December 2016 proclamation. That same act allowed President Donald Trump to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/08/deb-haaland-bears-ears-national-monument\">shrink the protected area to 200,000 acres</a> in 2017 – and President Joe Biden to <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/08/a-proclamation-on-bears-ears-national-monument/\">re-expand it to 1.3 million acres</a> in 2021.</p>\n\n<h2>Other examples of redesignation</h2>\n\n<p>In rare cases, a community, group or other organization proposes adding an area that is not currently managed by the National Park Service to the system, but this <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RS20158\">takes a lot of time</a> and is different from the more common process of changing the formal designation of a property already within the system.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm\">Indiana Dunes National Park</a> in 2019. That same year, White Sands National Monument in New Mexico became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm\">White Sands National Park</a>.

But the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ128/PLAW-115publ128.pdf\">law that formalized the change</a> included no additional funding, resources or protections for the Gateway Arch.</p>\n\n<p>Changing the designation contradicted the park service’s own declaration that the term “national park” should be used for an area that “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm\">contains a variety of resources</a> and encompasses large land or water areas to help provide adequate protection of the resources.” </p>\n\n<p>During congressional hearings, the deputy director of the National Park Service, Robert Vogel, recommended the site not be labeled a national park but rather a national monument, because the site “<a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/ocl/s-1438\">is too small and limited</a> in the range of resources the site protects and interprets to be called a national park.”</p>\n\n<p>Gateway Arch National Park is now the smallest-area park in the U.S., at less than 200 acres, and is home to a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/the-significance-of-the-gateway-arch-landscape.htm\">large steel arch, an open lawn area, a museum and a single historic building</a> – a courthouse where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/och.htm\">one of the Dred Scott trials</a> was heard, along with other civil rights cases. It does not have the wildlife viewing, spectacular geologic features, outdoor recreation opportunities and sense of wilderness that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-74653-6_8\">the public has come to expect from national parks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The park’s website admits “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/learn/nature/plants.htm\">it is unusual for a national park to have no natural plant life</a>” and describes the park as adjacent to the “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/learn/nature/animals.htm\">concrete jungle of downtown St. Louis</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What actually would change for Ocmulgee Mounds?</h2>\n\n<p>The redesignation effort for Ocmulgee Mounds has two primary aspects. First, it would declare the area a national park.</p>\n\n<p>Second, it would add additional land to this protected area, designating that portion as a national preserve. The distinction matters: Public hunting, including traditional Indigenous hunting, is not allowed in national parks, but it is allowed in national preserves. And while national parks are managed by the National Park Service under the Department of Interior, national preserves can be <a href=\"https://cepp.stanford.edu/focal-areas/wildfire-climate-resilience/tribal-stewardship-and-management-national-park-service\">managed in collaborative partnership</a> with other groups, including local Indigenous people with cultural ties to the land.</p>\n\n<p>The changes for Ocmulgee Mounds are supported by members of <a href=\"https://www.macon.com/news/environment/article312215663.html\">both political parties in both houses of Congress</a>. And the redesignation does not appear to have triggered <a href=\"https://www.njherald.com/story/news/environment/2024/04/21/delaware-water-gap-national-park-why-nj-legislators-are-fighting-it/73404753007/\">opposition from local communities</a>, who in other places have objected for several reasons, including fear of increased tourism and desire to <a href=\"https://scarab.bates.edu/honorstheses/181/\">preserve any long-standing uses of the land</a> that would be banned if it were to become a national park.</p>\n\n<p>There are redesignation efforts underway seeking to make national parks in other locations as well, including the <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/delaware-water-gap-national-park/\">Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area</a> in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/arizona-national-monument-converting-into-a-national-park-is-getting-mixed-reactions/\">Chiricahua National Monument</a> in Arizona, <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/americas-first-national-river-could-be-the-next-new-national-park-in-the-us/\">Buffalo National River</a> in Arkansas, and <a href=\"https://tiffany.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-tiffany-reintroduces-bill-create-wisconsins-first-national-park\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a> in Wisconsin.</p>\n\n<p>The only real changes in these places, though, would be in marketing – the signs, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/hfc/a-brief-history-of-the-unigrid.htm\">brochures</a> and merchandise sold in gift shops. But these changes would have an important effect: The tagline of “new national park” <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/public-lands/protected-lands/national-monuments-redesignated-national-parks/\">markets well</a> and is believed to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41816\">help attract more visitors</a> to the site. But it won’t actually protect these landscapes any better than they already are under the stewardship of the National Park Service.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268474/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Seth T.

Six organizations were also indicted, including the Gestapo and the SS. The tribunal, which took place in Nuremberg, Germany, and resulted in 19 convictions, <a href=\"https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Reporting_the_Nuremberg_Trials.html?id=EOOw0AEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">attracted worldwide media attention</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Eighty years later, you’ll hear terms like “war crimes” and “genocide” be deployed and debated – whether they’re applied to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/30/war-crimes-hegseth-venezuela-strikes-00671160\">use of military force in the Caribbean</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">Israel’s destruction of the Gaza Strip</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The public’s understanding of these terms is due, in large part, to the success of the Nuremberg trials and the remarkable degree of international cooperation they required. But the shakiness of international justice today, along with the ongoing complexity of legal and moral conceptions of guilt, shows the limits of the law when it comes to holding the worst of the worst accountable.    </p>\n\n<h2>Not the first attempt at international justice</h2>\n\n<p>These trials were not the first effort to prosecute war crimes in an international court. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Leipzig_Trials/XjbkrQEACAAJ?hl=en\">1921 Leipzig war crimes trials</a> took place to take legal action against Germans accused of war crimes in World War I. These trials, however, were stymied by <a href=\"https://www.historians.org/resource/what-happened-after-the-last-war/\">practical and procedural issues</a>, including <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1919Parisv13/ch16subch1\">difficulty bringing the accused to court</a> and locating evidence. They ultimately led to only six convictions – accompanied by light sentences – and even some of those were later overturned.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of man with mustache wearing a suit and tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=830&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705435/original/file-20251130-56-yaz19l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1044&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of War Henry L.

Some officials, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/2617836\">such as U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson</a>, argued in favor of trials that adhered closely to American legal principles. Others, like British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, objected, <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691092782/stay-the-hand-of-vengeance?srsltid=AfmBOooY83seEosY4SYyMpNnYGC1Id5pcMtkkY6E2FF3I7JGGpMBdTRm\">specifically citing the failure of the Leipzig trials</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But several aspects were different this time around. </p>\n\n<p>When the four chief prosecutors of the International Military Tribunal, representing the U.K., U.S., USSR and France, <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/count.asp\">filed the indictment for the Nuremberg trials</a>, most of the accused were already in custody. The prosecuting attorneys also had access to <a href=\"https://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/\">a trove of Nazi documents</a> to build their cases. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, beyond a <a href=\"https://www.roberthjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Justice_Jackson_s_Final_Report.pdf\">remarkable degree of cooperation</a> among those four nations, there was considerable public interest in and support for the trials. <a href=\"https://libsysdigi.library.uiuc.edu/OCA/Books2009-07/publicopinionino00merr/publicopinionino00merr.pdf\">Even swaths of the German public championed them</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>New categories for crimes</h2>\n\n<p>There still needed to be a solid legal basis for the trials. Some defendants argued that their actions, at the time, had been legal under German law. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, the charter that established the International Military Tribunal represented a significant development by outlining and defining the specific crimes that would fall under its jurisdiction: <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf\">war crimes, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>While the category of war crimes was based on <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/lawwar.asp\">existing international conventions</a>, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity had not been previously codified.</p>\n\n<p>The International Military Tribunal proceedings began on Nov. 20, 1945, and the hearings lasted until Sept. 1, 1946. Four judges – one from each of the countries convening the tribunal – presided over the case. Each of the four convening countries also appointed a chief prosecutor to lead the prosecution. Defendants were allowed to select their own legal counsel, <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3566&amp;context=jclc\">subject to the court’s approval</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 1, 1946, after a month of deliberation, <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/10-01-46.asp\">the judges issued the final rulings</a>. Of the 22 individual defendants, 19 were found guilty, 12 of whom were sentenced to death.</p>\n\n<h2>Blind spots</h2>\n\n<p>One notable detail of <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtchart.asp\">the agreement</a> that established the International Military Tribunal was the stipulation that it would be used to punish “<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf\">the major war criminals of the European Axis</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Atrocities committed by Allied forces, however, were not subject to the court’s scrutiny as possible war crimes, nor were actions taken by Allied governments domestically, including the <a href=\"https://densho.org/\">incarceration of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/visiting/exhibitions/harlanfiskestone/Section4.aspx\">Harlan Fiske Stone</a> expressed misgivings about the legal precedent he saw the trials setting. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/harlanfiskestone0000maso\">In a letter</a> discussing International Military Tribunal chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson – who, at the time, was Stone’s colleague on the Supreme Court – Stone lamented, “I don’t mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law.”</p>\n\n<p>Questions about the complicity of everyday German citizens and those in Nazi-occupied territories were also left unresolved.

It was the “massed angered forces of common humanity.” </p>\n\n<p>In the 80 years since, the world has witnessed countless conflicts and atrocities unfold across the globe, yet only a relatively small number of the alleged perpetrators have been tried before international courts.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond staunch disagreement over how to stop them, you’ll see debates over whether they even constitute crimes in the first place. The legitimacy of international courts is also disputed: In August 2025, the U.S. – which does not belong to the International Criminal Court – <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/icc-strongly-rejects-new-us-sanctions-against-judges-and-deputy-prosecutors\">imposed sanctions on ICC officials</a> after the court issued arrest warrants against top Israeli officials over alleged crimes in Gaza. </p>\n\n<p>Watching “Nuremberg” in light of Stimson’s claim, you might wonder how to view this current moment vis-à-vis this earlier era. </p>\n\n<p>Have political and social conditions shifted to such an extent that appealing to the “forces of common humanity” is no longer a viable political strategy? Or is the takeaway that there is always value in endeavoring to cultivate some form of consensus – no matter how small – over whether certain lines can never be crossed?</p>\n\n<p>Even if consensus remains elusive, one thing is clear: The world’s knowledge of terms like “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” provides a universally understood way to push back against unfolding atrocities.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269263/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>B.B.

The kidney had been engineered to mimic human tissue and was grown in a pig, as an alternative to waiting around for a human organ donor who might never come. For decades, this idea lived at the edge of science fiction. Now <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">it’s on the table</a>, literally.</p>\n\n<p>The patient is one of six taking part in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-xenotransplant-addc5a8b6a09d73e021efc9c8eafabc9\">first clinical trial of pig-to-human kidney transplants</a>. The goal: to see whether gene-edited pig kidneys can safely replace failing human ones.</p>\n\n<p>A decade ago, scientists were chasing a different solution. Instead of editing the genes of pigs to make their organs human-friendly, they tried to grow human organs – made entirely of human cells – inside pigs. But in 2015 the <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-158.html\">National Institutes of Health paused funding</a> for that work to consider its ethical risks. The pause remains today.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gApV_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">bioethicist and philosopher</a> who has spent years studying the ethics of using organs grown in animals – including serving on an NIH-funded national working group examining oversight for research on human-animal chimeras – I was perplexed by the decision. The ban assumed the danger was making pigs too human. Yet regulators now seem comfortable making humans a little more pig.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it considered ethical to put pig organs in humans but not to grow human organs in pigs?</p>\n\n<h2>Urgent need drives xenotransplantation</h2>\n\n<p>It’s easy to overlook the desperation driving these experiments. More than 100,000 Americans are <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics#\">waiting for organ transplants</a>. Demand overwhelms supply, and thousands die each year before one becomes available. </p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">looked across species for help</a> – from baboon hearts in the 1960s to genetically altered pigs today. The challenge has always been the immune system. The body treats cells it does not recognize as part of itself as invaders. As a result, it destroys them.</p>\n\n<p>A recent case underscores this fragility. A man in New Hampshire <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-xenotransplant-dialysis-7bb8dcc1a2e02bc16a9a27ef8071ee64\">received a gene-edited pig kidney</a> in January 2025. Nine months later, it had to be removed because its function was declining. While this partial success gave scientists hope, it was also a reminder that rejection remains a central problem for transplanting organs across species, also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/organs-from-genetically-engineered-pigs-may-help-shorten-the-transplant-wait-list-175893\">known as xenotransplantation</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OmAUHpsRw0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Decades of research have led to the first clinical trial of pig kidney transplants.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Researchers are attempting to work around transplant rejection by creating an organ the human body might tolerate, inserting a few human genes and deleting some pig ones. Still, recipients of these gene-edited pig organs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.899657\">need powerful drugs to suppress the immune system</a> both during and long after the transplant procedure, and even this may not prevent rejection. Even human-to-human transplants <a href=\"https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/living-with-a-kidney-transplant/kidney-transplant-medicines/\">require lifelong immunosuppressants</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why another approach – <a href=\"https://stanmed.stanford.edu/caution-surrounds-research-into-growing-human-organs-in-animals/\">growing organs from a patient’s own cells</a> – looked promising. This involved disabling the genes that let pig embryos form a kidney and injecting human stem cells into the embryo to fill the gap where a kidney would be. As a result, the pig embryo would grow a kidney genetically matched to a future patient, theoretically eliminating the risk of rejection.</p>\n\n<p>Although simple in concept, the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6153627/\">execution is technically complex</a> because human and pig cells develop at different speeds. Even so, five years prior to the NIH ban, researchers had already done something similar by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.039\">growing a mouse pancreas inside a rat</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-species organ growth was not a fantasy – it was a working proof of concept.</p>\n\n<h2>Ethics of creating organs in other species</h2>\n\n<p>The worries motivating the NIH ban in 2015 on inserting human stem cells into animal embryos did not come from concerns about scientific failure but rather from moral confusion. </p>\n\n<p>Policymakers feared that human cells might spread through the animal’s body – even into its brain – and in so doing blur the line between human and animal. The NIH warned of possible “<a href=\"https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/QA_Chimera_Policy_updated_1_Feb_2017.pdf\">alterations of the animal’s cognitive state</a>.” The Animal Legal Defense Fund, an animal advocacy organization, argued that if such chimeras gained humanlike awareness, they <a href=\"https://aldf.org/article/animal-legal-defense-fund-urges-national-institutes-of-health-to-recognize-rights-of-humanized-animals/\">should be treated as human research subjects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The worry centers on the possibility that an animal’s <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/grounds-moral-status/\">moral status</a> – that is, the degree to which an entity’s interests matter morally and the level of protection it is owed – might change. Higher moral status requires better treatment because it comes with vulnerability to greater forms of harm. </p>\n\n<p>Think of the harm caused by poking an animal that’s sentient compared to the harm caused by poking an animal that’s self-conscious. A sentient animal – that is, one capable of experiencing sensations such as pain or pleasure – would sense the pain and try to avoid it. In contrast, an animal that’s self-conscious – that is, one capable of reflecting on having those experiences – would not only sense the pain but grasp that it is itself the subject of that pain. The latter kind of harm is deeper, involving not just sensation but awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the NIH’s concern is that if human cells migrate into an animal’s brain, they might introduce new forms of experience and suffering, thereby elevating its moral status.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of piglets moving between bars\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706526/original/file-20251204-66-v0cg5n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">How human do pigs need to be for them to be considered part of the human species?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ProducingPigOrgans/4c584661922c49eb8c587887c8d187d9/photo\">AP Photo/Shelby Lum</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The flawed logic of the NIH ban</h2>\n\n<p>However, the reasoning behind the NIH’s ban is faulty. If certain cognitive capacities, such as self-consciousness, conferred higher moral status, then it follows that regulators would be equally concerned about inserting dolphin or primate cells into pigs as they are about inserting human cells. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2013.868951\">They are not</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, the moral circle of beings whose interests matter is drawn <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105139\">not around self-consciousness but around species membership</a>. Regulators protect all humans from harmful research because they are human, not because of their specific cognitive capacities such as the ability to feel pain, use language or engage in abstract reasoning. In fact, many people lack such capacities. Moral concern flows from that relationship, not from having a particular form of awareness. No research goal can <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/science-requires-ethical-oversight-without-federal-dollars-societys-health-and-safety-are-at-risk-252794\">justify violating the most basic interests</a> of human beings.</p>\n\n<p>If a pig embryo infused with human cells truly became something close enough to count as a member of the human species, then current research regulations would dictate it’s owed human-level regard. But the mere presence of human cells doesn’t make pigs humans.</p>\n\n<p>The pigs engineered for kidney transplants already carry human genes, but they aren’t called half-human beings.

On one recent weekend, I headed to the chimpanzees first.</p>\n\n<p>Their breakfast was still scattered around their enclosure for them to find. Ripley, one of the male chimpanzees, quickly gathered up some fruits and vegetables, sometimes using his feet almost like hands. After he ate, he used his feet to grab the fire hoses hanging around the enclosure and even held pieces of straw and other toys in his toes.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself feeling a bit envious. Why can’t people use our feet like this, quickly and easily grasping things with our toes just as easily as we do with our fingers? </p>\n\n<p>I’m a biological anthropologist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oohs4RcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">studies the biomechanics of the modern human foot and ankle</a>, using mechanical principles of movement to understand how forces affect the shape of our bodies and how humans have changed over time. Your muscles, brain and how human feet evolved all play a part in why you can’t wiggle individual toes one by one.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"young chimp running on all fours\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703536/original/file-20251119-56-h9yhrv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chimpanzee hands and feet do similar jobs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/male-chimpanzee-youngster-royalty-free-image/169726893\">Manoj Shah/Stone via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Comparing humans to a close relative</h2>\n\n<p>Humans are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/primate-mammal\">primates</a>, which means we belong to the same group of animals that includes apes like Riley the chimp.

But over time our lineage started <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright\">walking on two legs</a>. Human feet needed to change to help us stay balanced and to support our bodies as we walk upright.

Over time, our fingers became better at moving on their own. People use their hands to do lots of things, such as drawing, texting or playing a musical instrument. Even typing this article is possible only because my fingers can make small, careful and controlled movements.</p>\n\n<p>People’s feet and hands evolved for different purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>Muscles that move your fingers or toes</h2>\n\n<p>Evolution brought these differences about by physically adapting our muscles, bones and tendons to better support walking and balance. Hands and feet have similar anatomy; both have five fingers or toes that are moved by muscles and tendons. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539705/\">human foot contains 29 muscles</a> that all work to help you walk and stay balanced when you stand. In comparison, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279362/\">hand has 34 muscles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the muscles of your foot let you point your toes down, like when you stand on tiptoes, or lift them up, like when you walk on your heels. These muscles also help feet roll slightly inward or outward, which lets you keep your balance on uneven ground. All these movements work together to help you walk and run safely. </p>\n\n<p>The big toe on each foot is special because it helps push your body forward when you walk and has extra muscles just for its movement. The other four toes don’t have their own separate muscles. A few main muscles in the bottom of your foot and in your calf move all four toes at once. Because they share muscles, those toes can wiggle, but not very independently like your fingers can. The calf muscles also have long tendons that reach into the foot; they’re better at keeping you steady and helping you walk than at making tiny, precise movements.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a pen and ink drawing of the interior anatomy of a human hand\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=828&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703522/original/file-20251119-56-relukh.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1041&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Your hand is capable of delicate movements thanks to the muscles and ligaments that control its bones.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray427.png\">Henry Gray, 'Anatomy of the Human Body'/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In contrast, six main muscle groups help move each finger. The fingers share these muscles, which sit mostly in the forearm and connect to the fingers by tendons. The thumb and pinky have extra muscles that let you grip and hold objects more easily. All of these muscles are specialized to allow careful, controlled movements, such as writing.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, I have more muscles dedicated to moving my fingers, but that is not the only reason I can’t wiggle my toes one by one.</p>\n\n<h2>Divvying up brain power</h2>\n\n<p>You also need to look inside your brain to understand why toes and fingers work differently. Part of your brain called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03460-4\">motor cortex</a> tells your body how to move. It’s made of cells called neurons that act like tiny messengers, sending signals to the rest of your body.</p>\n\n<p>Your motor cortex devotes many more neurons to controlling your fingers than your toes, so it can send much more detailed instructions to your fingers. Because of the way your motor cortex is organized, it takes more “brain power,” meaning more signals and more activity, to move your fingers than your toes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"illustration of a brain looking down at the top of the head with one section highlighted orange\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703538/original/file-20251119-66-ypc3rt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The motor cortex of your brain sends orders to move parts of your body.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/human-brain-with-highlighted-precentral-royalty-free-illustration/1316975491\">Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even though you can’t grab things with your feet like Ripley the chimp can, you can understand why. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

And foreign policy types with axes to grind have been making good use of this other meaning, too.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, academic Walter Russell Mead <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-war-of-revision-is-coming-russia-china-taiwan-national-security-4e2184a7?mod=article_inline\">warned in his Wall Street Journal column</a> of the threat from the “axis of revisionist powers” – namely China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.</p>\n\n<p>The same grouping has gone by other names, too: the “<a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/axis-of-upheaval\">axis of upheaval</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/hauser-symposium-axis-autocracies\">axis of autocracies</a>” among them.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.macalester.edu/political-science/facultystaff/andrewlatham/\">scholar of international relations</a>, I know that framing any coalition or grouping as an “axis” does more than merely describe — it does some serious geopolitical work. The term summons the memory of the original “axis,” that of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/axis-powers-world-war-ii\">Axis powers of World War II</a>. </p>\n\n<p>What it attempts to do is cast any named grouping of countries as similarly dangerous, duplicitous or degenerate. To call a group of nations an “axis” is to situate them in a lineage of villainy, transforming today’s rivalries into an echo of that original alliance.</p>\n\n<h2>The origins of the ‘axis’</h2>\n\n<p>The naming of today’s “axes” tends to come out of think tanks and foreign policy institutions of the U.S. But the origin story begins not in Washington, but in Rome. </p>\n\n<p>In 1936, Italy’s fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed that a “<a href=\"https://www.e-ir.info/2011/07/29/hitler-and-mussolini-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-rome-berlin-axis-1936-1940/\">Rome–Berlin Axis</a>” would divide Europe, constituting a geopolitical line around which other countries would orbit.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"A drawing of a samurai standing over destroyed boats with flags behind him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=845&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706447/original/file-20251204-78-y7xt7b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1062&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A propaganda poster for the original ‘axis’ – Italy, Germany and Japan.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patto_Tripartito.jpg\">Gino Boccasile, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>By the time of World War II, the term “<a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/axis-powers-world-war-ii\">Axis powers</a>” had come to refer to the military coalition of Germany, Italy and Japan. In that historical context, the word “axis,” from the perspective of nations outside that group, carried connotations of unity, threat and evil from the offset.</p>\n\n<p>The term fell largely into disuse with the Axis powers’ defeat in 1945. </p>\n\n<p>That was until U.S. President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://fpif.org/deconstructing_george_w_bush_a_critical_analysis_of_the_2002_state_of_the_union_address/\">famously revived the word</a> after the Sept. 11 attacks. The “axis” he referenced in his 2002 State of the Union address wasn’t an existing alliance. Rather, he was creating one in the public imagination: an “axis of evil.”</p>\n\n<p>The three countries Bush named in that group – Iran, Iraq and North Korea – had little in common, beyond Washington’s suspicion. Yet by linking them under a single, ominous label, Bush transformed three separate challengers into a unified menace. </p>\n\n<p>The phrase “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4629258-thehill-com-opinion-international-4629258-axis-of-evil-iran-north-korea-china-russia-america/\">axis of evil</a>” was never meant to map reality; it was meant to shape it by fusing disparate adversaries into a single moral and strategic category.</p>\n\n<h2>From one metaphor to another</h2>\n\n<p>From Bush’s revival, the idea of axes took on a life of its own. Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar, a Libyan daily newspaper, retorted that in reality, <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1007/978-3-030-45465-4_4\">Bush’s targets comprised an “axis of resistance</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Iranian leaders and their allies picked that term up and reworked it to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-much-influence-does-iran-have-over-its-proxy-axis-of-resistance-hezbollah-hamas-and-the-houthis-221269\">apply to a network of aligned armed movements</a> across the Middle East, including the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>What had been a Western accusation was transformed into a badge of honor for those who defined themselves as resisting American hegemony and Israeli occupation.</p>\n\n<p>But it was the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 that revived the use of “axis” in the imagination of Washington analysts.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2024 article for Foreign Affairs, former U.S. foreign policy officials Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Richard Fontaine warned of an “<a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine\">axis of upheaval</a>” dedicated to “overturning the principles, rules and institutions that underlie the prevailing international system.”</p>\n\n<p>The four countries in this “axis” – China, Iran, North Korea and Russia – have little formal coordination. But the phrase captured something about mood and moment: the sense that the world is tilting toward multipolar rivalry and systemic friction.</p>\n\n<h2>Words that make worlds</h2>\n\n<p>Calling a coalition an “axis” is never a neutral act – it <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/force-isnt-only-way-to-confront-axis/\">is a political label</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It can transform separate grievances into one unified struggle, or it can reduce a complex relationship to an “us versus them” or “good versus evil” frame. </p>\n\n<p>The effect is double-edged. On the one hand, such language can be useful for mobilizing public opinion and bringing a sense of threat into focus. On the other, it makes categories more rigid and diplomacy harder. Once a nation has been put on an “axis” list, engagement can become morally freighted, and compromise can be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/585998-learning-the-real-lessons-of-neville-chamberlains-appeasement/\">framed as appeasement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The “axis of evil” label, for instance, helped make possible the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but it made talks with Iran and North Korea politically toxic for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Whether “evil,” “resistance” or “upheaval,” each variant of the “axis” metaphor tells us something about the way that political language constructs the world it describes. </p>\n\n<p>When we talk about an “axis,” we are not just mapping alliances in the world. We are also helping to define the moral geography of global politics — and deciding who stands inside the circle of legitimacy, and who stands outside it.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article is part of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/foreign-policy-101-171483\">series explaining foreign policy terms</a> commonly used but rarely explained.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268146/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Andrew Latham does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\">the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally</a> and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-citizenship-chaos-was-averted-for-now-by-a-class-action-injunction-against-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-260175\">wave of litigation</a> culminating in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/trump-v-washington-2/\">Trump v. Washington</a>, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts. </p>\n\n<p>When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/\">14th Amendment</a>, known as the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xiv/clauses/700\">citizenship clause</a>: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p>\n\n<p>Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context? </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://baker.utk.edu/person/morgan-marietta/\">close observer of the court</a>, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.</p>\n\n<h2>Arguments for automatic citizenship</h2>\n\n<p>Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be <a href=\"https://akhilamar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Interpretation-The-Citizenship-Clause-The-National-Constitution-Center.pdf\">broad rather than narrow</a>, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://history.nycourts.gov/democracy-teacher-toolkit/civil-rights-and-reconstruction/\">Civil War amendments</a> – the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xiii\">13th</a>, <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xiv\">14th</a> and <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv\">15th</a> – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.</p>\n\n<p>One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.</p>\n\n<p>Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/169us649\">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a> in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act\">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>If we read the Constitution in a <a href=\"https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/living-constitution\">living fashion</a> – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, advocates must try to convince the court’s <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/white-papers/on-originalism-in-constitutional-interpretation\">originalists</a> – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/georgetown-law-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2021/01/Ramsey_Originalism-and-Birthright-Citizenship.pdf\">originalist argument</a> in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “<a href=\"https://lawliberty.org/forum/why-you-cant-understand-the-constitution-without-the-common-law/\">customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-in-1924-all-indians-made-united-states-citizens\">discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment</a> was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the <a href=\"https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1924-indian-citizenship-act/\">citizenship of Native Americans in 1924</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-364/380988/20251029143516758_BrOfRespts_States.pdf\">advocates of automatic birthright citizenship</a> conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.</p>\n\n<h2>Opposition to birthright citizenship</h2>\n\n<p>The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as <a href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-question-of-birthright-citizenship\">citizenship without consent</a>. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.</p>\n\n<p>This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/02/18/birthright-citizenship/\">only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others</a>, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.</p>\n\n<p>The court’s ruling in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/112/94/\">Elk v. Wilkins</a> in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325\">entry into the United States without approval a federal offense</a>, Congress has effectively denied that consent. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5140319\">Scholars who support this view</a> argue that the 14th Amendment <a href=\"https://liveutk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/mmariett_utk_edu/Documents/Birthright%20Citizenship%202025%208.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=SzGnnV\">does not provide this consent</a>. Instead it sets a limitation. <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/meeting/house/117923/documents/HHRG-119-JU10-20250225-SD005.pdf\">To the authors of the 14th Amendment</a>, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual. </p>\n\n<p>Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A seated man in a suit and tie signs a document.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706739/original/file-20251205-66-8g2ecx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump signs an executive order on birthright citizenship in the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ImmigrationBirthrightCitizenship/fe62f8fb3d0a4f5cb8c8061926159125/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-364/378054/20250926163913772_Trump%20v.%20Washington%20with%20appendix.pdf\">opponents of birthright citizenship</a> argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of <a href=\"https://openyls.law.yale.edu/entities/publication/ad47c235-ca27-4241-a8a2-0565eb8bf753\">Calvin’s Case</a> or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>In this view, the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\">Declaration of Independence</a> replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities. </p>\n\n<p>For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent. </p>\n\n<p>Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.</p>\n\n<h2>What might happen</h2>\n\n<p>The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.</p>\n\n<p>The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp. </p>\n\n<p>The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.</p>\n\n<p>America should know by July Fourth.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271064/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Morgan Marietta does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

About 90% of that subset developed a chronic infection. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., 1 in 4 children chronically infected with hepatitis B will <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm\">die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/index.html#toc\">fewer than 1,000</a> American children or adolescents contract the virus every year – a 95% drop. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/about/national-profile.html#\">Fewer than 20 babies each year</a> are reported infected at birth. </p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/25677\">pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist</a> who studies vaccine delivery and policy. Vaccinating babies for hepatitis B at birth remains one of the clearest, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-001255\">most evidence-based ways to keep American children free</a> of this lifelong, deadly infection.</p>\n\n<h2>What spurred the change?</h2>\n\n<p>In September 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/agendas.html\">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP</a>, an independent panel of experts that advises the CDC, debated changing the recommendation for a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth, but ultimately delayed the vote. </p>\n\n<p>This committee regularly reviews vaccine guidance. However, since Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rfk-jrs-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisory-committee-raises-worries-about-scientific-integrity-of-health-recommendations-258674\">disbanded the entire committee</a> and handpicked new members, its activity has drastically departed from business as usual. The committee has long-standing procedures for evaluating evidence on the risks and benefits of vaccines, but these <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5508009-bill-cassidy-warning-hep-b-childhood-vaccine-delay/\">procedures were not followed</a> in the September meeting and were not followed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/health/cdc-vaccine-committee-newborns-hepatitis-b.html\">for this most recent decision</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The committee’s new recommendation keeps the hepatitis B vaccine at birth for infants whose mothers test positive for the virus. But the committee now advises that infants whose mothers test negative should consult with their health care provider. Parents and health care providers are instructed to weigh vaccine benefits, vaccine risks and infection risks using “individual-based decision-making” or “<a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-update-healthcare-professionals/newsletter/shared-clinical-decision-making-what-it-and-why-it-matters\">shared clinical decision-making</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSZWLFC86GY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The hepatitis B vaccine has an outstanding safety record and has been administered to billions of infants at birth.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>On the surface, this sounds reasonable. But while parents have always been free to discuss benefits and risks with their health care providers to make a decision on what’s best for their child, this change is not based on any new evidence, and it introduces uncertainty into a recommendation that has long been clear.</p>\n\n<p>As a doctor, I am already seeing this uncertainty play out in the clinic. I recently had new parents ask to postpone the hepatitis B vaccine until adolescence because they believed federal health leaders had evidence that people only become infected through sexual activity or contaminated needle use. </p>\n\n<p>After a brief conversation, they came to understand that this was inaccurate — children can be infected not only at birth but also through <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6701a1\">routine household or child care exposures</a>, including shared toothbrushes or even a bite that breaks the skin. In the end, they chose to vaccinate, but this experience highlights how easily well-intentioned parents can be misled when guidance is not clear and consistent.  </p>\n\n<h2>Why the CDC adopted universal hepatitis B shots</h2>\n\n<p>Hepatitis B is a virus that infects liver cells, causing inflammation and damage. It is spread through <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802\">blood and bodily fluids</a> and is easily transmitted from mother to baby during delivery.</p>\n\n<p>The hepatitis B vaccine has been <a href=\"https://www.hepb.org/prevention-and-diagnosis/vaccination/history-of-hepatitis-b-vaccine/\">available since the early 1980s</a>. Before 1991, public health guidance recommended giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041917.htm\">only if they were at high risk of being infected</a> – for example, if they were born to a mother infected with hepatitis B. </p>\n\n<p>That targeted plan failed. Tens of thousands of infants were still infected each year. </p>\n\n<p>Some newborns were exposed when their mothers weren’t screened; others were exposed after their mothers were infected late in pregnancy, after their initial screening. And like any lab test, the screening can have false negative results, be misinterpreted or not be communicated properly to the baby’s care team. </p>\n\n<p>Recognizing these gaps, in 1991 the CDC recommended hepatitis B vaccination <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm\">for every child starting at birth</a>, regardless of maternal risk. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. adopted a policy of vaccinating all babies from birth because the number of people with hepatitis B infections was, and remains, relatively high, and because many mothers do not receive prenatal care, so their infections go undetected.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in some European countries, like Denmark, only babies with certain risk factors receive the vaccine at birth. That’s because in those countries, hepatitis B infections <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7030a1\">are much less prevalent and pregnant mothers are more widely tested</a> due to universal health care. Due to these differences, that approach is not effective in the United States. In fact, most World Health Organization member countries <a href=\"https://www.globalhep.org/news-blogs/answering-key-questions-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-critical-time\">do recommend a universal birth dose</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Vaccinating at birth</h2>\n\n<p>The greatest danger for infants contracting hepatitis B is at birth, when contact with a mother’s blood can transmit the virus. Without preventive treatment or vaccination, 70% to 90% of infants born to infected mothers will become infected themselves, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm\">90% of those infections will become chronic</a>. The infection in these children silently damages their liver, potentially leading to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyi206\">liver cancer and death</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Newborn lying on exam table touching doctor's stethoscope\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691623/original/file-20250918-56-j1hs9u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Children are most likely to get infected by hepatitis B at birth, when contact with their mother’s blood can transmit the virus.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/newborn-baby-lying-on-clinic-bed-while-pediatric-royalty-free-image/2196118161\">Ekkasit Jokthong/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>About <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/childvaxview/about/interactive-reports.html\">80% of parents choose to vaccinate their babies at birth</a>. If parents choose to delay vaccination due to this new recommendation, it will leave babies unprotected during this most vulnerable window, when infection is most likely to lead to chronic infection and silently damage the liver.</p>\n\n<p>A research article published on Dec. 3, 2025, estimates that if only infants born to mothers infected with hepatitis B received the vaccine, an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.24996\">additional 476 perinatal hepatitis B infections</a> would occur each year.</p>\n\n<p>The hepatitis B vaccines used in the U.S. have an outstanding safety record. The only confirmed risk is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/hepatitis-b.html\">that occurs in roughly 1 in 600,000 doses</a>, and no child has died from such a reaction. Extensive studies show no link to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa668\">other serious conditions</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>How children get exposed to hepatitis B</h2>\n\n<p>Infants and children continue to be vulnerable to hepatitis B long after birth. </p>\n\n<p>Children can become <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm\">infected through household contacts</a> or in child care settings by exposures as ordinary as shared toothbrushes or a bite that breaks the skin. Because hepatitis B can <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-hep-b-live-outside-the-body\">survive for a week</a> on household surfaces, and many carriers are unaware they are infected, even babies and toddlers of uninfected mothers remained at risk. </p>\n\n<p>Full protection against hepatitis B <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1732166\">requires a three-dose vaccine series</a>, given at specific intervals in infancy. Anything short of the full series leaves children vulnerable for life. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to changing the birth dose recommendation, the committee is now advising parents to consult with their health care provider about checking children’s antibody levels after one or two doses of the vaccine to determine whether additional doses are needed. While such testing is sometimes recommended for people in high-risk groups after they get all three doses to confirm their immune system properly responded to the vaccine, it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6701a1\">not a substitute for completing the series</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The recommendation for all babies to receive the vaccine at birth and for infants to complete the full vaccine series is designed to protect every child, including those who slip through gaps in maternal screening or encounter the virus in everyday life. A reversion to the less effective risk-based approach threatens to erode this critical safety net.</p>\n\n<p><em>Portions of this article originally appeared in a previous article published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hepatitis-b-shot-for-newborns-has-nearly-eliminated-childhood-infections-with-this-virus-in-the-us-265560\">Sept. 9, 2025</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271202/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Higgins is affiliated with the American Academy of Pediatrics, Immunize Colorado, and Colorado Chooses Vaccines.

Most recently, on Dec. 2, 2025, families in Texas <a href=\"https://www.au.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ashby-Complaint.pdf\">filed a class-action lawsuit</a> seeking to take down displays across the state. <a href=\"https://www.au.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/78_Order_granting_Pl_August_20_2025.pdf\">Federal trial court judges</a> have already <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/federal-judge-orders-texas-schools-defy-state-law-requiring-ten-commandment-2025-11-19/\">temporarily blocked the law</a> in around two dozen districts. Ongoing appeals from the bills’ supporters, though, seem aimed at overturning a 45-year-old U.S. <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980/80-321\">Supreme Court precedent</a> prohibiting such displays.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/lydia-artz-2469854\">religion and education</a> <a href=\"https://udayton.edu/directory/education/eda/russo_charles.php\">law researchers</a>, we believe this situation is especially noteworthy because of its timing. In 2022, the Supreme Court adopted <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf\">a new standard</a> to assess religious freedom cases, which may come into play – and its judgments on religion’s role in public education are perhaps the most religion-friendly they have ever been.</p>\n\n<h2>The Ten Commandments and the courts</h2>\n\n<p>Controversy over the commandments is not new. In more than a dozen <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/7986700/pfeiffer-v-board-of-education/\">early cases</a>, courts <a href=\"https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/hackett-v-brooksville-graded-902340986\">generally upheld</a> laws and policies mandating their recitation in schools. These enactments survived because the Supreme Court did not <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/296\">extend the First Amendment to state laws</a> until 1940. </p>\n\n<p>Litigation over posting the Ten Commandments in schools first reached the Supreme Court in 1980. In <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/449/39\">Stone v. Graham</a>, the justices invalidated a Kentucky statute requiring displays of the commandments in classrooms. The court reasoned that the law violated <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\">the First Amendment’s establishment clause</a>: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”</p>\n\n<p>At the time, the court applied the first of the three criteria it has since abandoned, known as the “Lemon test,” to evaluate whether governmental action violates the establishment clause. Under this test – which developed from <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/602\">a 1971 Supreme Court decision</a> – governmental actions must have a secular legislative purpose, and their main effect may neither advance nor inhibit religion. In addition, they must avoid excessive entanglement with religion.</p>\n\n<p>In Stone, the justices rejected Kentucky’s argument that the displays served a secular educational purpose. The court disagreed that a small notation on posters describing the Ten Commandments as the “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/449/39\">fundamental legal code</a> of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States” was sufficient, noting that the posters were “plainly religious in nature.”</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-five years later, in 2005, litigation over public displays of the Ten Commandments returned to the Supreme Court. This time, neither display was in a school.</p>\n\n<p>The first dispute arose in Kentucky, where officials in two counties had erected courthouse displays including the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. The justices limited their order to one dispute, in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1693.ZS.html\">McCreary County</a>, invalidating the display for violating the establishment clause – largely because it lacked a secular legislative purpose.</p>\n\n<p>On the same day, the Supreme Court reached the opposite result in another case, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1500.ZO.html\">Van Orden v. Perry</a>. The court permitted a display including the Ten Commandments to remain on the grounds of the Texas Capitol in Austin, where it was one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two women walk by an ornately carved stone monument, with a building with a large rotunda in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689071/original/file-20250904-64-qmztnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas Capitol in Austin.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=texas%20commandments&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Eric Gay</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unlike the fairly new displays in Kentucky, the long-standing one in Texas, with the first monument <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-5th-circuit/1170824.html\">erected in 1891</a>, was built using private funds.

Alyssa Brown, one of the Arkansas bill’s sponsors, described it as an effort to educate students on how the United States was founded and how the founders framed the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re not telling every student they have to believe in this God,” <a href=\"https://www.kuaf.com/show/ozarks-at-large/2025-04-15/bill-requiring-ten-commandments-display-in-arkansas-public-buildings-becomes-law\">she told a legislative committee</a>, “but we are upholding what those historical documents mean and that historical national motto.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large room, seen from above, with rows of desks encircling a central podium.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689079/original/file-20250904-56-dg812b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Arkansas representatives convene in the House chamber at the state Capitol in Little Rock on June 17, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/MortuaryTheft-Arkansas/01673b8e359b4d1c9851960e43bec36b/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Andrew DeMillo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Texas, meanwhile, adopted <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/html/SB00010H.htm\">a similar law</a> in June 2025. </p>\n\n<p>“It is incumbent on all of us to follow God’s law, and I think we would all be better off if we did,” the bill’s sponsor in the Texas House, Republican Rep. Candy Noble, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/ten-commandments-texas-schools-senate-bill-10/\">said during debate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Shift at SCOTUS</h2>\n\n<p>Supporters of these laws <a href=\"https://baptiststandard.com/news/texas/house-committee-holds-ten-commandments-bill-hearing/\">argue that they are constitutional</a> because of an important shift at the Supreme Court. In 2022, the court adopted a new “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/magazine/history-tradition-law-conservative-judges.html\">history and tradition test</a>” to assess religion in public places, including classrooms.</p>\n\n<p>The “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/magazine/history-tradition-law-conservative-judges.html\">history and tradition test</a>” originated in 2022’s <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/21-418\">Kennedy v. Bremerton School District</a>, a case about a public high school football coach who <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-the-supreme-courts-football-decision-is-a-game-changer-on-school-prayer-184619\">prayed on the field</a> at the end of games. The court ruled that school officials could not prevent the coach from praying because it was a personal religious observance protected by the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\">First Amendment’s</a> other religion clause: that the government shall not prohibit the “free exercise” of religion.</p>\n\n<p>The Kennedy case charted a new course on religion’s place in public life. Acknowledging that it “long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot,” the justices explained that “the Establishment Clause must be interpreted <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/21-418\">by ‘reference to historical practices and understandings</a>.‘” It remains to be seen how this standard plays out.</p>\n\n<h2>Blocked – for now</h2>\n\n<p>In August 2025, a federal trial court temporarily <a href=\"https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arkansas/arwdce/5:2025cv05127/74528/71\">barred officials in four school districts from enforcing Arkansas’ law</a>. The court found that the required display would have “forced [students] to engage with” the Ten Commandments, and “perhaps to venerate and obey” them. The court also applied the new historical practices and understandings test, holding that there was no evidence of a tradition to display the Ten Commandments in public schools permanently.</p>\n\n<p>The same judge later <a href=\"https://www.acluarkansas.org/press-releases/federal-court-blocks-lakeside-school-district-from-posting-ten-commandments/\">prohibited two more Arkansas school boards</a> from posting displays.</p>\n\n<p>In Louisiana, too, a federal trial court <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/g-s1-33848/louisiana-ten-commandments-classroom-federal-judge-blocks\">blocked a state statute</a>. The 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals initially <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/21/nx-s1-5441035/louisiana-ten-commandments-schools-court-blocks\">affirmed that order</a>. However, an en banc panel of the 5th Circuit – meaning all the circuit’s active judges – will rehear the case on Jan. 20, 2026.</p>\n\n<p>The Texas statute’s future is also up in the air. In August 2025, a federal trial court <a href=\"https://www.au.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/78_Order_granting_Pl_August_20_2025.pdf\">enjoined the law</a>, temporarily stopping it from going into effect in 11 districts. Acknowledging the cases from Arkansas and Louisiana, the judge held that Texas’ law likely violated the First Amendment. The full 5th Circuit <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/appeals-court-heightens-stakes-over-ten-commandments-school-laws/2025/10\">will hear oral arguments</a> in January, alongside the Louisiana case.</p>\n\n<p>On Nov. 18, a second federal trial court judge <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/federal-judge-orders-texas-schools-defy-state-law-requiring-ten-commandment-2025-11-19/\">enjoined the Texas law</a> in around a dozen new districts.</p>\n\n<h2>Religion’s role</h2>\n\n<p>Controversy over the Ten Commandments continues to raise larger questions over the role of religion in public education, if any.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of such bills seemingly fail to recognize that they cannot <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2025-08-15/starting-in-september-every-texas-public-classroom-must-post-ten-commandments/\">impose their religious values in the public sphere</a>. At the same time, some opponents – including Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, Hindu and nonreligious plaintiffs – do not necessarily wish to remove religion entirely from educational institutions.</p>\n\n<p>These critics want to uphold the principle that, as the Supreme Court has affirmed, the government must demonstrate “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1693.ZO.html\">neutrality between religion and religion</a>, and between religion and nonreligion.” In other words, critics do not want one religion or religion generally to dominate.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s challenge is to find the balance in public life. We believe the courts and legislatures must avoid sending the message that religion has no place in a free and open society – just as they must not permit one set of values to dominate, as the bills in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas seem to aspire to do. </p>\n\n<p>How the courts and legislatures balance the rights of the majority and minority in these disputes over the place of the Ten Commandments in public life may go a long way toward shaping the future of religious freedom in American public education.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is an updated version of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/3-states-push-to-put-the-ten-commandments-back-in-school-banking-on-new-guidance-at-the-supreme-court-264423\">an article originally published on Sept. 5, 2025</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271287/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The casual izakaya part of the restaurant did receive a Bib Gourmand, but the review doesn’t mention the food at the omakase bar, leading chef-owner Jesse Ito and Philly food critic Craig LaBan <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/foodnews/is-michelin-s-bib-award-for-royal-sushi-a-snub-chef-jesse-ito-takes-the-izakaya-s-honors-in-stride/ar-AA1QTTBO\">to speculate</a> that Michelin inspectors couldn’t get a reservation. If that’s the case, it’s inexcusable. When asked, a Michelin spokesperson said <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/foodnews/is-michelin-s-bib-award-for-royal-sushi-a-snub-chef-jesse-ito-takes-the-izakaya-s-honors-in-stride/ar-AA1QTTBO\">they don’t “reveal specifics</a>.” Michelin inspectors should do the work to get into the critically acclaimed places.</p>\n\n<p>As for Mawn: Wait in line for their no-reservation lunch like the rest of Philly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to eat now?</h2>\n\n<p>As a strategy for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2023.100738\">building tourism</a>, filling seats during lunch hours and early in the week, and recruiting out-of-town restaurant talent, Michelin makes a lot of sense for Philly. But many people don’t realize that <a href=\"https://www.discoverphl.com/press-room/michelin-guide/\">Michelin is pay-to-play</a> in the locations included in its guides, so Philly’s lack of Michelin stars before last month should not indicate that the city’s restaurant scene was not already Michelin-worthy. We just hadn’t paid for the privilege of being inspected.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Michelin awards are just one of <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/06/17/phila-lorn-wins-2025-james-beard-award/\">many awards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deliciouscitypodcast.com/the-tasties\">accolades</a> that Philly restaurants can get.</p>\n\n<p>The Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau has not stated how much they paid to have an outside for-profit company come and confirm that Philly indeed has good restaurants. But in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/food/article/texas-houston-michelin-guide-cost-19620549.php\">Houston reportedly agreed to pay the Michelin Guide $270,000</a> for the privilege. Assuming Philadelphia paid a similar amount, if not more, that averages to about 100K per star.</p>\n\n<p>In Philadelphia, that money could have been used for scholarships for culinary students, workforce development training ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.visitphilly.com/2026-philadelphia/\">city’s celebration of the nation’s 250th birthday</a> or strengthening high school and community college culinary and hospitality programs. It could have gone to tax incentives or lowering hurdles for underrepresented or emerging restaurateurs – uses I believe would make Philly’s food scene even stronger. </p>\n\n<p>Instead it was used to give restaurants that had already received prestigious James Beard awards and other recognition even more kudos – making them even more difficult to get into for Philadelphians and tourists alike. </p>\n\n<p>In a city <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/philly-sports-fans-consider-themselves-gritty-but-its-merely-a-myth-used-to-fuel-their-passion-245996\">known for its grit</a>, doing its thing whether you like it or not, and thumbing its nose at New York and Washington, D.C., this whole thing strikes me as very un-Philly.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to make it a point to visit all the restaurants I love that haven’t gotten the credit they deserve. With <a href=\"https://www.foodylytics.com/statistics/pennsylvania/philadelphia\">over 6,000 restaurants in Philadelphia</a>, I’ll be busy. The tourists can have the Michelin places until the hype dies down. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271049/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jonathan Deutsch does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

At other times, they are a potpourri of various cultural trends, as with 2022’s “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/goblin-mode-new-oxford-word-of-the-year\">goblin mode</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63458467\">permacrisis</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/gaslighting-is-merriam-websters-2022-word-of-the-year\">gaslighting</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>This year’s slate largely centers on digital life. But rather than reflecting the unbridled optimism about the internet of the early aughts – when words like “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/w00t-crowned-word-of-year-by-us-dictionary-idUSN11551595/\">w00t</a>,” “<a href=\"https://dcist.com/story/04/11/30/blog-merriamwe/\">blog</a>,” “<a href=\"https://americandialect.org/2009_word_of_the_year_is_tweet_word_of_the_decade_is_google/\">tweet</a>” and even “<a href=\"https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2015/\">face with tears of joy</a>” emoji (😂) were chosen – this year’s selections reflect a growing unease over how the internet has become a hotbed of artifice, manipulation and fake relationships.</p>\n\n<h2>When seeing isn’t believing</h2>\n\n<p>A committee representing the Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English settled on “AI slop” for their word of the year. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-for-2025/\">Macquarie defines the term</a>, which was popularized in 2024 by British programmer <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/\">Simon Willison</a> and tech journalist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/podcasts/ai-slop-bitcoin-hot-mess.html?showTranscript=1\">Casey Newton</a>, as “low-quality content created by generative AI, often containing errors, and not requested by the user.”</p>\n\n<p>AI slop – which can range from a saccharine image of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-ai-slop-a-technologist-explains-this-new-and-largely-unwelcome-form-of-online-content-256554\">young girl clinging to her little dog</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/linkedin-ai-generated-influencers/\">career advice on LinkedIn</a> – often goes viral, as gullible social media users share these computer-generated videos, text and graphics with others.</p>\n\n<p>Images have been manipulated or altered <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/political-photo-manipulation-in-history\">since the dawn of photography</a>. The technique was then improved, with an assist from AI, to create “deepfakes,” which allows existing images to be turned into video clips in surreal ways. Yes, you can now watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BX4-NvaC0\">Hitler teaming up with Stalin</a> to sing a 1970s hit by The Buggles.</p>\n\n<p>What makes AI slop different is that images or video can be created out of whole cloth by providing a chatbot with just a prompt – <a href=\"https://www.sify.com/ai-analytics/the-internets-ai-slop-problem/\">no matter how bizarre</a> the request or ensuing output.</p>\n\n<h2>Meet my new friend, ChatGPT</h2>\n\n<p>The editors of the Cambridge Dictionary chose “<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/news-and-insights/parasocial-is-cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025\">parasocial</a>.” They define this as “involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-losing-kobe-bryant-felt-like-losing-a-relative-or-friend-130836\">a famous person they do not know</a>, a character in a book, film, TV series … or an artificial intelligence.”</p>\n\n<p>These asymmetric relationships, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/news-and-insights/parasocial-is-cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025\">according to the dictionary’s chief editor</a>, are the result of “the public’s fascination with celebrities and their lifestyles,” and this interest “continues to reach new heights.” </p>\n\n<p>As an example, Cambridge’s announcement cited the <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/editorial/word-of-the-year\">engagement of singer Taylor Swift and football player Travis Kelce</a>, which led to a spike in online searches for the meaning of the term. Many Swifties <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I49lvQhpBuQ\">reacted with unbridled joy</a>, as if their best friend or sibling had just decided to tie the knot.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DR2PkLZEeT1&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>But the term isn’t a new one: It was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049\">coined by sociologists</a> in 1956 to describe “the illusion” of having “a face-to-face relationship” with a performer.</p>\n\n<p>However, parasocial relationships can take a bizarre or even ominous turn when the object of one’s affections is a chatbot. People are developing true feelings for these AI systems, whether they see them as a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/people-who-use-chatgpt-too-much-are-becoming-emotionally-addicted-to-it/\">trusted friend</a> or even a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/05/magazine/ai-chatbot-marriage-love-romance-sex.html\">romantic partner</a>. <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/09/teens-are-using-chatbots-as-therapists-thats-alarming.html\">Young people</a>, in particular, are now turning to generative AI <a href=\"https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/on-the-horizon/chatbots-replace-therapists\">for therapy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Taking the bait</h2>\n\n<p>The Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year is “rage bait,” which <a href=\"https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/\">the editors define</a> as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content.”</p>\n\n<p>This is only the latest word for forms of emotional manipulation that have plagued the online world since the days of dial-up internet. Related terms include trolling, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ElaineStead/sealioning-1448061bb73a\">sealioning</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/theview/comments/1567ruo/shitposting/\">trashposting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike a hot take – a hasty opinion on a topic that may be poorly reasoned or articulated – rage baiting is intended to be inflammatory. And it can be seen as both a cause and a result of <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/social-media-outrage-culture-rcna235160\">political polarization</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People who post rage bait have been <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/202009/why-do-internet-trolls-act-the-way-they-do\">shown to lack empathy</a> and to regard other people’s emotions as something to be exploited or even monetized.

In this case, the controversy <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/style/gen-z-six-seven-meme-gen-alpha-absurdity.html\">has to do with the actual meaning</a> of this bit of Gen Alpha slang. The editors of the website <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year-2025/\">describe it</a> as being “meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical.”</p>\n\n<p>Although its definition may be slippery, the term itself can be found in the lyrics of the rapper Skrilla, who released the single “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/18DEvCPCmzVpo2en9DeylA?si=4d6928fec6fd408a\">Doot Doot (6 7)</a>” in early 2025. It was popularized by 17-year-old basketball standout <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6619536/2025/09/12/basketball-taylen-kinney-high-school-social-trend/\">Taylen Kinney</a>. For his part, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/10/29/67-is-dictionarycoms-word-of-the-year-but-what-does-the-viral-phrase-mean/\">Skrilla claimed</a> that he “never put an actual meaning on it, and I still would not want to.”</p>\n\n<p>“6-7” is sometimes accompanied by a gesture, as if one were comparing the weight of objects held in both hands. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15324553/Keir-Starmer-apology-school-teacher-children-67-meme.html\">recently performed</a> this hand motion during a school visit. The young students were delighted. Their teacher, however, informed Starmer that her charges weren’t allowed to use it at the school, which prompted a clumsy apology from the chastened prime minister.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1995984020950450510&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Throw your hands in the air?</h2>\n\n<p>The common element that these words share may be an attitude best described as <a href=\"https://medium.com/@philosophy.101/digital-nihilism-does-constant-access-to-information-erode-meaning-c4f261a33dce\">digital nihilism</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As online misinformation, AI-generated text and images, fake news and conspiracy theories abound, it’s increasingly difficult to know whom or what to believe or trust. Digital nihilism is, in essence, an acknowledgment of a lack of meaning and certainty in our online interactions.</p>\n\n<p>This year’s crop of words might best be summed up by a single emoji: the shrug (🤷). Throwing one’s hands up, in resignation or indifference, captures the anarchy that seems to characterize our digital lives.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270769/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Roger J.

Boys and men are more likely to use alternative shortcuts, such as rounding both numbers, adding the rounded figures, and then adjusting to remove the rounding.</p>\n\n<p>But those who use traditional methods on basic problems are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.70047\">less likely to solve more complex math problems</a> correctly. These are the main findings of two studies our research team published in November 2025.</p>\n\n<p>This new evidence may help explain an apparent contradiction in the existing research – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036620\">girls do better at math in school</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/average-sat-score-full-statistics/#demographics\">boys do better on high-stakes math tests</a> and are more likely to <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/reports/statistics/diversity-stem-women-minorities-persons-disabilities-2023\">pursue math-intensive careers</a>. Our research focuses not just on getting correct answers, but on the methods students use to arrive at them. We find that boys and girls approach math problems differently, in ways that persist into adulthood.</p>\n\n<h2>A possible paradox</h2>\n\n<p>In a 2016 study of U.S. elementary students, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332858416673617\">boys outnumbered girls 4 to 1</a> among the top 1% of scorers on a national math test. And over many decades, boys have been about <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/huge-gender-differences-persist-on-sat-math-test/\">twice as likely as girls</a> to be <a href=\"https://aibm.org/research/boys-girls-and-grades-examining-gpa-and-sat-trends/\">among the top scorers on the SAT</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/girls-still-fall-behind-boys-in-top-scores-for-ap-math-exams-174192\">AP math</a> exams.</p>\n\n<p>However, girls tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332858416673617\">be more diligent</a> in elementary school and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036620\">get better grades in math class</a> throughout their schooling. And girls and boys across the grades tend to score similarly on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1160364\">state math tests</a>, which tend to be more aligned with the school curriculum and have more familiar problems than the SAT or other national tests.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond grades and test scores, the skills and confidence acquired in school carry far beyond, into the workforce. In lucrative STEM occupations, such as computer science and engineering, <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/reports/statistics/diversity-stem-women-minorities-persons-disabilities-2023\">men outnumber women 3 to 1</a>. Researchers have considered several explanations for this disparity, including differences in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157447\">math confidence</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165025415616201\">occupational values</a>, such as prioritizing helping others or making money. Our study suggests an additional factor to consider: gender differences in approaches to math problems. </p>\n\n<p>When older adults think of math, they may recall memorizing times tables or doing the tedious, long-division algorithm. Memorization and rule-following can pay off on math tests focused on procedures taught in school.

We wondered whether these differences disappear after elementary school, or whether they persist and relate to gender disparities in more advanced math outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>In an earlier study, we surveyed students from two high schools with different demographic characteristics to see whether they were what we called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5951/jresematheduc-2020-0136\">bold problem-solvers</a>. We asked them to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with specific statements, such as “I like to think outside the box when I solve math problems.” Boys reported bolder problem-solving tendencies than girls did. Importantly, students who reported bolder problem-solving tendencies scored higher on a math problem-solving test we administered.</p>\n\n<p>Our newer studies echo those earlier results but reveal more specifics about how boys and girls, and men and women, approach basic math problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Algorithms and teacher-pleasing</h2>\n\n<p>In the first study, we gave three questions to more than 200 high school students: “25 x 9 = ___,” “600 – 498 = ___,” and “19 + 47 + 31 = ___.” Each question could be solved with a traditional algorithm or with a mental shortcut, such as solving 25 x 9 by first multiplying 25 x 8 to get 200 and then adding the final 25 to get 225.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of their gender, students were equally likely to solve these basic computation items correctly. But there was a striking gender difference in how they arrived at that answer. Girls were almost three times as likely as boys – 52% versus 18% – to use a standard algorithm on all three items. Boys were far more likely than girls – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.70047\">51% versus 15%</a> – to never use an algorithm on the questions.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"MPiQv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MPiQv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>We suspected that girls’ tendency to use algorithms might stem <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1477878508099748\">from greater social pressure toward compliance</a>, including complying with traditional teacher expectations.</p>\n\n<p>So, we also asked all the students eight questions to probe how much they try to please their teachers. We also wanted to see whether algorithm use might relate to gender differences in more advanced problem-solving, so we gave students several complex math problems from national tests, including the SAT.</p>\n\n<p>As we suspected, we found that girls were more likely to report a desire to please teachers, such as by completing work as directed. Those who said they did have that desire used the standard algorithm more often. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the boys in our sample scored higher than the girls on the complex math problems. Importantly, even though students who used algorithms on the basic computation items were just as likely to compute these items correctly, algorithm users did worse on the more complex math problems. </p>\n\n<h2>Continuing into adulthood</h2>\n\n<p>In our second study, we gave 810 adults just one problem: “125 + 238 = ___.” We asked them to add mentally, which we expected would discourage them from using an algorithm. Again, there was no gender difference in answering correctly. </p>\n\n<p>But 69% of women, compared to 46% of men, reported <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.70047\">using the standard algorithm for their mental calculation</a>, rather than using another strategy entirely.</p>\n\n<p>We also gave the adults a more advanced <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1930297500001819\">problem-solving test</a>, this time focused on probability-related reasoning, such as the chances that rolling a seven-sided die would result in an even number. Similar to our first study, women and those who used the standard algorithm on the computation problem performed worse on the reasoning test.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of inventiveness</h2>\n\n<p>We identified some factors that may play a role in these gender differences, including spatial-thinking skills, which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-019-01694-7\">may help people develop alternate calculation approaches</a>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2010.488723\">Anxiety about taking tests</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11031-022-09931-8\">perfectionism</a>, both more prevalent among women, may also be a factor.</p>\n\n<p>We are also interested in the power of gender-specific social pressures on girls. National data has shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332858416673617\">young girls exhibit more studious behavior than do boys</a>. And the high school girls we studied were more likely than boys to report they made a specific effort to meet teachers’ expectations.</p>\n\n<p>More research definitely is needed to better understand this dynamic, but we hypothesize that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/opinion/l21girls.html\">expectation some girls feel to be compliant and please others</a> may drive teacher-pleasing tendencies that result in girls using algorithms more frequently than boys, who are more socialized to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1006/jecp.2000.2572\">risk-takers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While compliant behavior and standard math methods often lead to correct answers and good grades in school, we believe schools should prepare all students – regardless of gender – for when they face unfamiliar problems that require inventive problem-solving skills, whether in daily life, on high-stakes tests or in math-intensive professions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269059/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But that’s not always the reality. Gifts can be tricky and rife with <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jconrs/v27y2000i1p84-95.html\">hidden hazards</a>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721416656937\">Relationships can even be ruined</a> when the mismatch between the giver’s intention and the recipient’s perceptions of it is too vast. </p>\n\n<p>The circumstances of the people involved also shape a gift’s meaning and the way it might be interpreted. </p>\n\n<p>My research partner, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hxh-oCkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Nathalie Rita</a>, and I have been seeking to better understand gifting in one of life’s most dicey, distressing circumstances: cancer. </p>\n\n<p>As sociologists, we use techniques such as in-depth interviews to study the experiences, feelings and motivations of specific groups of people. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CZTXnM0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I focus</a> on <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/making-it/9781978840126/\">restaurant workers</a> and my colleague <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/28ef5deedd5265ad26c5a565059497c0/1\">on migrants</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2021.1981965\">minorities</a>. But in 2021, we were both diagnosed with cancer in our early 30s – breast cancer for me and endometrial cancer for her. This encouraged us to explore the experiences of other young women dealing with cancer. </p>\n\n<p>By 2023, we had interviewed 50 millennial women diagnosed with cancer about a plethora of social and emotional topics related to their illness. Our own bouts with cancer revealed curious patterns in the gifts we very gratefully received from family and friends. So, we included a few questions about gifts in our research. </p>\n\n<p>We expected some eccentric anecdotes similar to our own experiences. But our research, which isn’t yet published, revealed just how much of a mismatch there is between what people wanted and what they received – often driven by the marketing of specific gifts or care packages for cancer patients. </p>\n\n<h2>What loved ones give</h2>\n\n<p>One of our first questions was, what exactly do women diagnosed with cancer receive from their loved ones? Their answers ran the gamut. Our interviewees reported hundreds of gifts, from stuffed possums to child care help to Vitamix blenders. Friends and family were very eager to shower them in goods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from these hundreds of items and acts, 10 popped up over and over again. In order of frequency, they were:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Fuzzy socks.</li>\n<li> Food and drinks, particularly herbal teas, groceries, gourmet goodies and <a href=\"https://www.mealtrain.com\">Meal Trains</a>.</li>\n<li> Money, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com\">GoFundMe</a> donations and gift cards.</li>\n<li> Blankets.</li>\n<li> Fancy, spa-style self-care items. </li>\n<li> Written thoughts and prayers.</li>\n<li> Flowers and plants.</li>\n<li> Mugs, tumblers and bottles.</li>\n<li> Adult coloring books.</li>\n<li>Books.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The women we spoke with largely understood and appreciated the intentions behind these items in the context of their illness: books to distract, flowers to beautify. They viewed the gifts as material proof that their loved ones wanted to deliver comfort and support in a time of discomfort and helplessness. </p>\n\n<p>But the frequency of certain items perplexed us. Why socks and coloring books instead of, say, Rollerblades and bongs? </p>\n\n<h2>The long shadow of online commerce and gift guides</h2>\n\n<p>We traced these gifting trends to two sources: premade cancer care packages and online gift guides. </p>\n\n<p>Numerous women reported receiving some of the items from our top 10 list in premade care packages sourced from <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com\">Etsy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cancer+care+package\">Amazon</a> or cancer-specific companies such as <a href=\"https://www.rockthetreatment.com\">Rock the Treatment</a> and <a href=\"https://thebalmbox.com\">The Balm Box</a>. They noted that the contents of these packages felt predictable: spa-style self-care goods such as aromatherapy oils, lip balms and soy candles; herbal teas; a mug with a slogan or ribbon; and hard candies or throat lozenges. </p>\n\n<p>Some received more opulent care packages, similar to Rock the Treatment’s <a href=\"https://www.rockthetreatment.com/womens-large-chemo-basket/\">large chemo care package for women</a>, which adds adult coloring books, protein-rich snacks, a beanie and fuzzy socks. These additions mirror our interviewees’ top 10 received gifts even more closely.</p>\n\n<p>Online gift guides published by magazines, news sites and stores may be influencing gifters’ behaviors, too. A Google search for “gift guide” yields countless lists for niche demographics – <a href=\"https://camrynrabideau.com/2024/11/21/30-adorable-gifts-for-chicken-lovers-according-to-a-chicken-lover-herself/\">chicken lovers</a>, <a href=\"https://geniuslabgear.com/blogs/for-scientists/best-gifts-mathematicians\">mathematicians</a>, even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/gifts-for-people-who-are-always-cold/\">people who are always cold</a>. Online viewership of these lists is prolific. For example, New York Magazine’s product recommendation site, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/\">The Strategist</a>, received <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/online-gift-guides-are-playing-a-bigger-and-more-difficult-role-for-brands/\">10.7 million monthly views in 2021</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The top seven Google-ranked gift guides for cancer patients also contain suggestions that align almost perfectly with what our interviewees reported, with the addition of clothing and jewelry emblazoned with inspirational declarations such as “I’m stronger than cancer!”</p>\n\n<p>These overlaps reflect the broader phenomena of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/pinkification-breast-cancer-awareness-commodified\">commodification</a> and <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816648993/pink-ribbons-inc/\">commercialization</a> of cancer. As businesses seek to extract economic value out of all aspects of daily life, cancer has become a lucrative business opportunity and patients a source of profit.  </p>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that these market forces warp how gift givers perceive people with cancer and their desires. In turning <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pink-ribbon-blues-9780199933990\">cancer into something profitable</a>, the ugly parts of illness are also glossed over to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/girlie-or-girl-power-breast-cancer-and-the-cult-ure-of-pink-10477\">make cancer palatable to the market</a>. Businesses then sell would-be gifters the idea that cancer can be assuaged by purchasing and giving a bejeweled, teal-ribboned Stanley tumbler. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, while premade care packages ease the labor of decision-making for gifters, they run a greater risk of disappointing recipients. These generic boxes, we found, can communicate a degree of thoughtlessness at a time when our study participants were aching for thoughtfulness. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Woman delivering groceries to a neighbor\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704560/original/file-20251125-65-8xx6r2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Practical gifts, such as bringing groceries, can help relieve daily stressors for people coping with a serious illness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/unrecognizable-neighbor-delivers-fresh-groceries-to-royalty-free-image/1313503815\">SDI Productions/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What to actually gift</h2>\n\n<p>So, what do women going through cancer treatment actually want to receive? Our interviewees recommended:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Money in the form of cash or useful gift cards, such as for Door Dash, grocery stores and Petco.</li>\n<li>Meals and groceries, particularly if the recipient is a parent with mouths to feed.</li>\n<li>Help with errands and tasks such as babysitting, transportation, cleaning and lawn care.</li>\n<li>Cards and personal messages of love, which serve as check-ins and gestures of care and support.</li>\n<li>Practical self-care items such as thick lotions, face masks and soft soaps that don’t irritate skin.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pragmatic. Simple. Even a little mundane.</p>\n\n<p>There is some overlap between these recommendations and the frequently received gifts mentioned earlier. But notably, almost none of the women we interviewed expressed a desire for the nonessential items usually stocked in commercial care packages or those associated with profiting from cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the gifts they felt touched them more deeply were ones that addressed ways in which they felt the disease incapacitated their abilities as a worker, woman, mother or caregiver.</p>\n\n<p>Our interviewees spoke of financial strain from medical bills, fatigue preventing them from mothering in ways they used to, and mounting burdens that made it almost impossible to be present for partners or spouses. A <a href=\"https://hereshegrows.com/2025/01/05/monstera-deliciosa/\">monstera plant</a> in a whimsical vase offered little reprieve from these pressures. However, a chat while folding laundry or a Pyrex of enchiladas did. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, such offerings made them feel cared for and seen – their unvarnished circumstances recognized.</p>\n\n<p>So, if a friend with cancer – or any other serious illness, for that matter – is on your list this holiday season, consider hanging those fuzzy socks back on the rack.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, mull over their daily stresses, and choose an item – or a task – that provides a bit of relief.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268642/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ellen T.

That’s a question policymakers and watchdog organizations confronted as early as the 1980s and ’90s – and <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/European-and-American-Extreme-Right-Groups-and-the-Internet/Caiani-Parenti/p/book/9781138260917\">it hasn’t gone away</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Decades before <a href=\"https://icct.nl/publication/say-its-only-fictional-how-far-right-jailbreaking-ai-and-what-can-be-done-about-it\">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1803946\">Telegram</a> and white nationalist <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/podcasts/468776/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-republicans-nazi-antisemitic\">Nick Fuentes’ livestreams</a>, far-right extremists embraced the early days of home computing and the internet. These new technologies offered them a bastion of free speech and a global platform. They could share propaganda, spew hatred, incite violence and gain international followers like never before.</p>\n\n<p>Before the digital era, far-right extremists radicalized each other primarily using print propaganda. They wrote their own newsletters and reprinted far-right tracts such as <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/adolf-hitler\">Adolf Hitler</a>’s “<a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/mein-kampf\">Mein Kampf</a>” and American neo-Nazi <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/william-pierce/\">William Pierce</a>’s “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1542-734X.2009.00710.x\">The Turner Diaries</a>,” a dystopian work of fiction describing a race war. Then, they mailed this propaganda to supporters at home and abroad.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a historian who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C8&amp;q=Michelle+Lynn+Kahn&amp;btnG=\">studies neo-Nazis and far-right extremism</a>. As <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/25785648.2021.1901496\">my research</a> shows, most of the neo-Nazi propaganda confiscated in Germany from the 1970s through the 1990s came from the United States. American neo-Nazis exploited their free speech under the First Amendment to bypass German censorship laws. German neo-Nazis then picked up this print propaganda and distributed it throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>This strategy wasn’t foolproof, however. Print propaganda could get lost in the mail or be confiscated, especially when crossing into Germany. Producing and shipping it was also expensive and time-consuming, and far-right organizations were chronically understaffed and strapped for cash.</p>\n\n<h2>Going digital</h2>\n\n<p>Computers, which <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Computer-A-History-of-the-Information-Machine/Campbell-Kelly-Aspray-Yost-Tinn-ConDiaz/p/book/9781032203430\">entered the mass market</a> in 1977, promised to help resolve these problems. In 1981, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/longtime-neo-nazi-matthias-matt-koehl-dies/\">Matt Koehl</a>, head of the National Socialist White People’s Party in the United States, solicited donations to “Help the Party Enter The Computer Age.” The American neo-Nazi <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/106th-congress/senate-event/LC19436/text\">Harold Covington</a> begged for a printer, scanner and “serious PC” that could run WordPerfect word processing software. “Our multifarious enemies already possess this technology,” he noted, referring to Jews and government officials.</p>\n\n<p>Soon, far-right extremists figured out how to connect their computers to one another. They did so by using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/089443938600200302\">online bulletin board systems</a>, or BBSes, a precursor to the internet. A BBS was hosted on a personal computer, and other computers could dial in to the BBS using a modem and a terminal software program, allowing users to exchange messages, documents and software.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"tan personal computer\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1006&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1006&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705903/original/file-20251202-56-4p51jn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1006&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">After personal computers became commonplace but before the internet, people connected online via bulletin board systems.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/48699533901\">Blake Patterson/Flickr</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>With BBSes, anyone interested in accessing far-right propaganda could simply turn on their computer and dial in to an organization’s advertised phone number. Once connected, they could read the organization’s public posts, exchange messages and upload and download files.</p>\n\n<p>The first far-right bulletin board system, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605241260002\">Aryan Nations Liberty Net</a>, was established in 1984 by <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/louis-beam/\">Louis Beam</a>, a high-ranking member of the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/ku-klux-klan/\">Ku Klux Klan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/aryan-nations/\">Aryan Nations</a>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637725.032\">Beam explained</a>: “Imagine, if you can, a single computer to which all leaders and strategists of the patriotic movement are connected. Imagine further that any patriot in the country is able to tap into this computer at will in order to reap the benefit of all accumulative knowledge and wisdom of the leaders. ‘Someday,’ you may say? How about today?”</p>\n\n<p>Then came violent <a href=\"https://gnet-research.org/2024/11/01/30-years-of-trends-in-terrorist-and-extremist-games/\">neo-Nazi computer games</a>. Neo-Nazis in the United States and elsewhere could upload and download these games via bulletin board systems, copy them onto disks and distribute them widely, especially to schoolchildren.</p>\n\n<p>In the German <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/world/video-game-uncovered-in-europe-uses-nazi-death-camps-as-theme.html\">computer game KZ Manager</a>, players role-played as a commandant in a Nazi concentration camp that murdered Jews, <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/2000926-Roma-and-Sinti.pdf\">Sinti and Roma</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009486682\">Turkish immigrants</a>. An early 1990s poll revealed that 39% of Austrian high schoolers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/world/video-game-uncovered-in-europe-uses-nazi-death-camps-as-theme.html\">knew of such games</a> and 22% had seen them.</p>\n\n<h2>Arrival of the web</h2>\n\n<p>By the mid-1990s, with the introduction of the more user-friendly <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/03/11/world-wide-web-timeline/\">World Wide Web</a>, bulletin boards fell out of favor. The first major racial hate website on the internet, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10576100903259951\">Stormfront</a>, was founded in 1995 by the American white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/don-black/\">Don Black</a>. The civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center found that almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/hate-crime-murders-website-stormfront-report\">100 murders</a> were linked to Stormfront.</p>\n\n<p>By 2000, the German government had discovered, and banned, over <a href=\"https://www.bpb.de/shop/zeitschriften/apuz/25438/rechtsextremismus-im-internet/\">300 German websites</a> with right-wing content – a tenfold increase within just four years.</p>\n\n<p>In response, American white supremacists again exploited their free speech rights to bypass German censorship bans. They gave international far-right extremists the opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/open-source-self-defence-tackling-the-challenge-of-extremist-websites-and-open-source-tech/\">host their websites</a> safely and anonymously on unregulated American servers – a strategy that continues today.</p>\n\n<h2>Up next: AI</h2>\n\n<p>The next frontier for far-right extremists is AI. They <a href=\"https://icct.nl/publication/say-its-only-fictional-how-far-right-jailbreaking-ai-and-what-can-be-done-about-it\">are using</a> <a href=\"https://gnet-research.org/2024/07/04/the-digital-weaponry-of-radicalisation-ai-and-the-recruitment-nexus/\">AI tools</a> to create targeted propaganda, manipulate images, audio and videos, and evade detection. The far-right social network Gab created a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gab-ai-chatbot-racist-holocaust/\">Hitler chatbot</a> that users can talk to.</p>\n\n<p>AI chatbots are also adopting the far-right views of social media users. Grok, the chatbot on Elon Musk’s X, recently called itself “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content\">MechaHitler</a>,” <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/groks-antisemitic-rant-shows-how-generative-ai-can-be-weaponized-257880\">spewed antisemitic hate speech</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/20/french-authorities-look-into-holocaust-denial-posts-elon-musk-grok-ai\">denied the Holocaust</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Countering extremism</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gcsp.ch/sites/default/files/2024-12/SSA-11-white-crusade-how-to-prevent-right-wing-extremists-from-exploiting-the-internet.pdf\">Combating online hate</a> is a global imperative. It requires comprehensive international cooperation among governments, nongovernmental organizations, watchdog organizations, communities and tech corporations.</p>\n\n<p>Far-right extremists have long pioneered innovative ways to exploit technological progress and free speech.

Once a missionary outpost, Latin America is now the heart of the Catholic Church. It is home to over 575 million adherents – <a href=\"https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-03/pontifical-yearbook-2025-priests-religious-statistics.html\">over 40% of all Catholics</a> worldwide. The next-largest regions are Europe and Africa, each home to 20% of the world’s Catholics.</p>\n\n<p>Yet beneath this Catholic dominance, the region’s religious landscape is changing.</p>\n\n<p>First, Protestant and Pentecostal groups <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/cura/tongues-of-fire-the-explosion-of-protestantism-in-latin-america/\">have experienced dramatic growth</a>. In 1970, <a href=\"https://legacy.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/#history-of-religious-change\">only 4% of Latin Americans</a> identified as Protestant; by 2014, the share <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/\">had climbed to almost 20%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But even as Protestant ranks swelled, another trend was quietly gaining ground: a growing share of Latin Americans <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/\">abandoning institutional faith altogether</a>. And, <a href=\"https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/gradstudents/mdb4748\">as my research shows</a>, the region’s religious decline shows a surprising difference from patterns elsewhere. While fewer Latin Americans are identifying with a religion or attending services, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251369926\">personal faith remains strong</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three women in white robes and caps stand outdoors at nighttime by a large wooden cross.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705391/original/file-20251130-56-tun1vv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Women known as ‘animeras,’ who pray for the souls of the deceased, walk to a church for Day of the Dead festivities in Telembi, Ecuador.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/PicturesoftheWeekLatinAmericaandCaribbeanPhotoGallery/a97c7fac8c634c028f1ce7fa28585714/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Carlos Noriega</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Religious decline</h2>\n\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/\">8% of Latin Americans</a> claimed no religion at all. This number is twice as high as the percentage of people who were raised without a religion, indicating that the growth is recent, coming from people who left the church as adults.</p>\n\n<p>However, there had been no comprehensive study of religious change in Latin America since then. My <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251369926\">new research</a>, published in September 2025, draws on two decades of survey data from over 220,000 respondents in 17 Latin American countries. This data comes from the <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/about-americasbarometer.php\">AmericasBarometer</a>, a large, region-wide survey conducted every two years by Vanderbilt University that focuses on democracy, governance and other social issues. Because it asks the same religion questions across countries and over time, it offers an unusually clear view of changing patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the number of Latin Americans reporting no religious affiliation surged from 7% in 2004 to over 18% in 2023. The share of people who say they are religiously unaffiliated grew in 15 of the 17 countries, and more than doubled in seven.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"sLFw3\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sLFw3/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>On average, 21% of people in South America say they do not have a religious affiliation, compared with 13% in Mexico and Central America. Uruguay, Chile and Argentina are the three least religious countries in the region. Guatemala, Peru and Paraguay are the most traditionally religious, with fewer than 9% who identify as unaffiliated.</p>\n\n<p>Another question scholars typically use to measure religious decline is how often people go to church. From 2008 to 2023, the share of Latin Americans attending church at least once a month decreased from 67% to 60%. The percentage who never attend, meanwhile, grew from 18% to 25%. </p>\n\n<p>The generational pattern is stark. Among people born in the 1940s, just over half say they attend church regularly. Each subsequent generation shows a steeper decline, dropping to just 35% for those born in the 1990s. Religious affiliation shows a similar trajectory – each generation is less affiliated than the one before.</p>\n\n<h2>Personal religiosity</h2>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251369926\">in my study</a>, I also examined a lesser-used measure of religiosity – one that tells a different story.</p>\n\n<p>That measure is “religious importance”: how important people say that religion is in their daily lives. We might think of this as “personal” religiosity, as opposed to the “institutional” religiosity tied to formal congregations and denominations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A spotlight shines on a zigzag row of people wearing jackets, with the rest of the crowd hidden in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705732/original/file-20251201-56-o4l2ts.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People attend a Mass marking the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on June 26, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/PicturesoftheWeekLatinAmericaandCaribbeanPhotoGallery/4bab7c97b46b46a1b545431600f77fce/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Like church attendance, overall religious importance is high in Latin America. In 2010, roughly 85% of Latin Americans in the 17 countries whose data I analyzed said religion was important in their daily lives. Sixty percent said “very,” and 25% said “somewhat.” </p>\n\n<p>By 2023, the “somewhat important” group declined to 19%, while the “very important” group grew to 64%. Personal religious importance was growing, even as affiliation and church attendance were falling.</p>\n\n<p>Religious importance shows the same generational pattern as affiliation and attendance: Older people tend to report higher levels than younger ones. In 2023, 68% of people born in the 1970s said religion was “very important,” compared with 60% of those born in the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>Yet when you compare people at the same age, the pattern reverses. At age 30, 55% of those born in the 1970s rated religion as very important. Compare that with 59% among Latin Americans born in the 1980s, and 62% among those born in the 1990s. If this trend continues, younger generations could eventually show greater personal religious commitment than their elders.</p>\n\n<h2>Affiliation vs. belief</h2>\n\n<p>What we are seeing in Latin America, I’d argue, is a fragmented pattern of religious decline. The authority of religious institutions is waning – fewer people claim a faith; fewer attend services. But personal belief isn’t eroding. Religious importance is holding steady, even growing.</p>\n\n<p>This pattern is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12551\">quite different from Europe and the United States</a>, where institutional decline and personal belief tend to move together.</p>\n\n<p>Eighty-six percent of unaffiliated people in Latin America say they believe in God or a higher power. That compares with only <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/05/Being-Christian-in-Western-Europe-FOR-WEB1.pdf\">30% in Europe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/01/24/religious-nones-in-america-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/\">69% in the United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sizable proportions of unaffiliated Latin Americans also believe in angels, miracles and even that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/chapter-3-religious-beliefs/\">Jesus will return to Earth in their lifetime</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, for many Latin Americans, leaving behind a religious label or skipping church does not mean leaving faith behind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a colorful knit hat and bright sweater or jacket holds up a small doll in a white robe that is surrounded by wisps of smoke.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=496&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=496&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705390/original/file-20251130-56-7ctr8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=496&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An Aymara Indigenous spiritual guide blesses a statue of baby Jesus with incense after an Epiphany Mass at a Catholic church in La Paz, Bolivia, on Jan. 6, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/PicturesoftheWeekLatinAmericaandCaribbeanPhotoGallery/14d4cf0557da4b1a9fac5b781b48dd18/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Juan Karita</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This distinctive pattern reflects Latin America’s unique history and culture. Since the colonial period, the region has been shaped by a <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/9781498238199/popular-religion-and-modernization-in-latin-america/\">mix of religious traditions</a>. People often <a href=\"https://www.thecollector.com/african-indigenous-catholic-faith-colonial-brazil/\">combine elements of Indigenous beliefs, Catholic practices and newer Protestant movements</a>, creating personal forms of faith that don’t always fit neatly into any one church or institution. </p>\n\n<p>Because priests <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24457734\">were often scarce in rural areas</a>, Catholicism <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300166804/new-worlds/\">developed in many communities</a> with little direct oversight from the church. Home rituals, local saints’ festivals and lay leaders helped shape religious life in more independent ways.</p>\n\n<p>This reality challenges how scholars typically measure religious change. Traditional frameworks for measuring religious decline, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0037768620917320\">developed from Western European data</a>, rely heavily on religious affiliation and church attendance. But this approach overlooks vibrant religiosity outside formal structures – and can lead scholars to mistaken conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Latin America reminds us that faith can thrive even as institutions fade.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266880/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>This research was supported by grants P2CHD042849 and T32HD007081, awarded to the Population Research Center at The University of Texas at Austin by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

It is also a strikingly fast pace for a country where <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16049.doc.htm\">insecurity persists</a> across broad regions.</p>\n\n<p>The scale and speed of these returns since the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-assad-regime-falls-what-happens-now/\">overthrow of Bashar Assad’s brutal regime</a> on Dec. 8, 2024, raise important questions: Why are so many Syrians going back, and will these returns last? Moreover, what conditions are they returning to?</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://polisci.richmond.edu/faculty/sjoirema/\">expert in property rights and post-conflict return migration</a>, I have monitored the massive surge in refugee returns to Syria throughout 2024. While a combination of push-and-pull factors have driven the trend, the widespread destruction of property during the brutal civil war poses an ongoing obstacle to resettlement.</p>\n\n<h2>Where are Syria’s refugees?</h2>\n\n<p>By the time a rebel coalition <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce313jn453zo\">led by Sunni Islamist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a> overthrew the Assad government, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/syrias-civil-war\">Syria’s civil war</a> had been going on for more than a decade. What began in 2011 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/17/what-is-the-arab-spring-and-how-did-it-start\">Arab Spring protests</a> quickly escalated into one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of Syrians were displaced internally, and about <a href=\"https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/statistics/\">6 million</a> sought refuge abroad. The majority went to neighboring countries, including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, but a little over <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/10/with-assad-gone-the-eu-wonders-should-syrian-refugees-be-sent-back\">a million sought refuge in Europe</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, European countries are struggling to determine how they should respond to the changed environment in Syria. Germany and Austria <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/09/germany-and-austria-freeze-syrian-asylum-applications-local-media-report\">have put a hold on</a> processing asylum applications from Syrians. The international legal principle of <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Migration/GlobalCompactMigration/ThePrincipleNon-RefoulementUnderInternationalHumanRightsLaw.pdf\">non-refoulement</a> prohibits states from returning refugees to unsafe environments where they would face persecution and violence.</p>\n\n<p>But people can choose to return home on their own. And the fall of Assad altered refugees’ perceptions of safety and possibility. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/media/2025-operational-framework-voluntary-return-syrian-refugees-and-idps\">U.N. refugee agency surveys</a> conducted in January 2025 across Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt found that 80% of Syrian refugees hoped to return home – up sharply from 57% the previous year. But hope and reality are not always aligned, and the factors motivating return are far more complex than the change in political authority.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=581&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=581&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706456/original/file-20251204-66-r4efpu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=581&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\"></span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria\">Sandra F.

Even then, people often return to their country but not their original communities, especially when local <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/bosnia-remade-9780199730360?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">political control</a> has shifted or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/dech.12236\">reconstruction remains incomplete</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In present-day Syria, violence continues in several regions, governance is fragmented, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-displacement.html\">sectarian conflicts persist</a>. Yet refugees are returning anyway.</p>\n\n<p>A major factor is the deteriorating conditions in neighboring host countries. Most of those who came back to Syria in the early months after Assad’s fall came from neighboring states that have hosted large refugee populations for more than a decade and are now struggling with economic crises, political tensions and declining aid.</p>\n\n<p>In Turkey, for example, Syrians have faced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/c16y07r4glwo\">increasing deportations</a> and growing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/migration/mnae009\">structural barriers</a> to integration, such as temporary status without the possibility of naturalization and strict local registration policies. </p>\n\n<p>In Lebanon, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/30/syrians-fleeing-lebanon-risk-repression-upon-return#:%7E:text=(Beirut)%20%E2%80%93%20Syrians%20fleeing%20violence,and%20July%2C%20informed%20sources%20said.\">recent violence</a> and a <a href=\"https://mecouncil.org/publication/from-exile-to-uncertainty-syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-consider-returning-home/\">steep drop</a> in international assistance have left Syrian refugees unable to secure food, education and health care.</p>\n\n<p>And in Jordan, <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2024/01/syrian-refugees-in-jordan-a-crisis-of-dwindling-humanitarian-aid?lang=en\">international reductions in humanitarian support</a> have made daily life more precarious for refugees. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, many Syrians are not returning because their homeland has become safer, but because the places where they sought refuge have become more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>We do not have data on the religious or ethnic makeup of returnees. But patterns <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/no-return-no-refuge/9780231153362/\">from other post-conflict settings</a> suggest that returnees are usually from the majority community aligned with the new dominant political actors. After the <a href=\"https://press.umich.edu/Books/P/Peace-Preference-and-Property2\">war in Kosovo</a>, for instance, ethnic Albanians returned quickly, while Serb and Roma minorities returned in much smaller numbers due to insecurity and threats of reprisals.</p>\n\n<p>If Syria follows this trajectory, Sunni Muslims may return in higher numbers, as the country’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, led the Sunni rebel coalition that overthrew Assad.</p>\n\n<p>Syrian minority groups, including Alawites, Christians, Druze and Kurds, may avoid returning altogether. Violent incidents targeting minority communities have underscored ongoing instability. <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2025/06/04/syrian-alawites-flee-lebanon-little-aid-meet-them?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Recent attacks</a> on the Alawite population have triggered new waves of displacement into Lebanon, while conflicts between Druze militias and the government in Sweida, in southern Syria, have led to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/syrias-south-bedouins-uprooted-by-sectarian-clashes-see-little-hope-return-2025-11-08/\">more displacement</a> within the country.

Those attacks killed people alleged to have been involved in illegal narcotics trafficking.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/boat-strikes-trump-hegseth-caribbean.html\">Congressional investigations have begun</a> into allegations that a Sept. 2, 2025, follow-up attack on two survivors of an earlier attack was illegal and ordered by Hegseth. Some legal scholars have <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/126156/expert-qa-on-the-u-s-boat-strikes/\">cited violations of international and United States criminal law</a> that could come into play.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lawschool.unm.edu/faculty/kastenberg/index.html\">But as a military law scholar</a> who spent 20 years as a lawyer and judge in the U.S. Air Force, I know that there aren’t enough facts known yet to determine who is responsible for what. There are five investigative mechanisms that could be used to determine the facts and whether there is criminal liability on the part of both senior civilian officials and military members involved in the now <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/new-details-emerge-controversial-sept-2-strike-alleged/story?id=128090044\">extensively reported second strike on the suspected drug boat</a> that resulted in the deaths of civilians.  </p>\n\n<p>There are two caveats to this analysis. The first is that the Constitution says a person is to be presumed innocent before being proved guilty. The second is that the story from the White House and the Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/04/trump-hegseth-responses-boat-strikes/\">has changed over time</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a dark blue military uniform walks among a number of men in suits.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C19%2C3321%2C2162&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706516/original/file-20251204-86-ld23b2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Navy Adm.

In theory, any of these committees can place people under oath and have them testify, as well as issue subpoenas to obtain information.  </p>\n\n<p>This concept isn’t new.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/History/Cryptologic-History/Historical-Events/Article-View/Article/2740707/the-investigations/\">Multiple committees examined</a> the country’s lack of preparedness preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and other military installations in 1941. </p>\n\n<p>Almost every month <a href=\"https://levin-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Portraits-in-Oversight-Fulbright-Investigation-Levin-Center.pdf\">during the Vietnam War, one or more of these committees investigated</a> military matters, including one of the most notorious war crimes in U.S. history. In 1968, Army Lt. William Laws Calley commanded a platoon of soldiers <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/vietnam-my-lai-massacre/\">who murdered close to 500 villagers in My Lai</a>, including children and the elderly, none of whom posed a threat and none of whom were lawful targets.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-partisan-and-policy-dynamics-shape-congressional-oversight-in-the-post-trump-era/\">But congressional investigations can be highly political</a>. Even during the My Lai investigation, at least one member of the House, Mendel Rivers, a South Carolina Democrat who was at that time chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, <a href=\"https://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mylai/ecktragedy.html\">attempted to shield officers in the chain of command</a>. There is little reason to believe that a current investigation, conducted by a dramatically polarized Congress, will be free of partisan politics.</p>\n\n<h2>Attorney general investigates</h2>\n\n<p>A second means of investigating is for the U.S. attorney general to preliminarily conclude that crimes have been committed and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury\">to convene a grand jury to investigate</a>. A federal grand jury is a constitutional body consisting of ordinary adult citizens. Its operations are governed by the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp\">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, and its role is to investigate whether there is probable cause to determine that a person has violated the criminal laws.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1536-murder-definition-and-degrees\">A federal statute prohibits murder</a>. <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep018/usrep018076/usrep018076.pdf\">As far back as 1820</a>, if not before, federal grand juries have investigated the crime of “murder on the high seas.”   </p>\n\n<p>No member of the president’s administration is immune from the criminal laws of the country, with the exception of the president himself when he has acted in the capacity of president or commander in chief. The Supreme Court in 2024 determined that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\">the president is mostly immune from prosecution under criminal law</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>But I believe this type of investigation is unlikely. That’s because members of the administration have argued that their actions were legal and that the men killed in the second strike <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/survivors-of-boat-strike-were-actively-continuing-drug-mission-admiral-to-tell-lawmakers-b82f0ab3?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">were continuing in their mission and posed a threat</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the attorney general is supposed to act in an independent capacity from the White House. But Trump’s attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493412/how-pam-bondi-has-redefined-the-attorney-general-role\">Pam Bondi, has demonstrated her loyalty to the president and his agenda</a> in many instances.  </p>\n\n<p>Another consideration is that federal agency heads who rely on their attorneys in good faith are presumed to <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/218/\">be immune from the law</a>. This may be why Hegseth has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/pentagon-lawyers-sidelined-jags\">stated that lawyers had advised the mission’s commanders</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Congress and the AG work a case</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible that during a congressional investigation one or more witnesses will be accused of lying under oath or accused of contempt.  </p>\n\n<p>Congress has the authority to hold individuals in contempt and fine and sentence them, but this is rare. Usually, Congress forwards the claim to the attorney general. <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10974\">Contempt of Congress is a federal misdemeanor offense</a>, meaning a person cannot be sentenced to more than a year. Again, I believe it is unlikely that the attorney general would pursue a contempt charge in a federal court from these events.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1967707828493386023&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Inspector general investigates</h2>\n\n<p>The Department of Defense’s inspector general can investigate allegations of wrongdoing in the department, and this includes the secretary. In the past, inspectors general have discovered criminal activity, written a publicly releasable report, and then a senior official was prosecuted.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2003, the Department of Defense investigated Darleen Druyun, a senior contracting official, for <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/defense/2004/10/ex-pentagon-procurement-executive-gets-jail-time/17737/\">wrongly steering multimillion-dollar contracts to Boeing</a>. The investigative report resulted in criminal charges from the Justice Department, and Druyun was found guilty in a criminal trial. Boeing officials also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/testimony/2006/080106dagmcnultystatementsenate.htm\">left the company</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2006/June/06_civ_412.html\">the company was fined</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The military can investigate its civilian members but cannot prosecute them. The <a href=\"https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/UCMJ%20-%2020December2019.pdf\">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> does not apply to civilians. That includes the president and secretary of defense, even though they are at the pinnacle of the chain of command. </p>\n\n<h2>International courts investigate</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, an investigation could be mounted through international law as enforced by courts outside of the United States.  </p>\n\n<p>Superpowers such as the United States and Russia often get a free pass from international law enforcement. In 1986, the International Court of Justice – a body partly created by the United States – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/28/world/world-court-supports-nicaragua-after-us-rejected-judges-role.html\">ruled that the United States under the Reagan administration violated Nicaragua’s sovereignty</a> during its civil war. </p>\n\n<p>The Reagan administration’s response was that because other nations had disregarded the court, <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1902&amp;context=faculty_publications\">so too would the United States</a>. No American official was <a href=\"https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/06/28/us-owes-nicaragua-reparations-1986-icj/\">ever held to account</a> for the mining of Nicaragua’s main port or for the arming of rebels that led to the deaths of Nicaraguans.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not clear which, if any, of these mechanisms will be used to hold accountable those who ordered and carried out the September 2025 operation in the Caribbean that killed two survivors of an earlier attack. What is clear is that the methods exist to find the facts – and make judgments based on them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271284/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Kastenberg does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

He explained how meditation can change our perceptions about the things we encounter in our daily lives by revealing this interdependence. </p>\n\n<p>Take the example of an apple: Before meditation, an apple is just a piece of fruit. During meditation, the meditator sees how deeply the apple is interconnected with the world – the apple would not exist without the rain, the sunshine, the soil and the farmer who planted the seed. These are just a few of the causes and conditions that allow the apple to exist.</p>\n\n<p>The apple is because of all these other things. An apple is not just a piece of fruit. The apple is also part rain, part sunlight, part soil, part farmer. </p>\n\n<p>After meditation, an apple goes back to being an apple again. The meditator continues to call it an “apple,” but they understand its true nature. Hanh calls this sense of connection “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuDSxr5qBT8\">interbeing</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The apple insight <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-diamond-that-cuts-through-illusion/\">applies to any object</a>: a mountain, a river, a tree, a person. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://jeremydavidengels.com\">my research</a>, I explore how the insights gained by practicing meditation can change how we live our daily lives. Inspired by Hanh, in my forthcoming book “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/on-mindful-democracy/\">On Mindful Democracy: A Declaration of Interdependence to Mend a Fractured World</a>,” I explore what happens when we make “interbeing” – or interdependence – the foundation of democracy. </p>\n\n<h2>The essence of interbeing</h2>\n\n<p>In his book “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-other-shore/\">The Other Shore</a>,” Hanh recounts how he coined the term “interbeing” during a retreat in California in the 1980s, while guiding a mindfulness meditation on the nature of a chair.</p>\n\n<p>He asked his students to look at the chair and notice the trees, sunshine, rain and clouds in it. He then wondered aloud if there was a word in English or French that could capture the reality that a chair is made up of things other than a chair: “I asked if the <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-other-shore/\">word ‘togetherness’ would do</a>. Somebody said that it sounded strange, so I suggested the word ‘interbeing.’” </p>\n\n<p>Hanh explains that interbeing means “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-diamond-that-cuts-through-illusion/\">this is because that is</a>.” No rain means no tree, and no tree means no apple and no chair. </p>\n\n<p>According to Hanh, this knowledge can help us to live a happier life because it reveals the miracle of existence. </p>\n\n<p>Consider all the causes and conditions that had to happen exactly as they did for an apple to exist. Had there been a drought that killed the tree when it was young, or a late spring freeze that stunted the apple flower, or had a person chopped the tree down to make space for a housing development, this particular apple would not exist. The apple is a small miracle composed of many other small miracles. </p>\n\n<p>From what I noticed staying at the Plum Village monastery Hanh established in southern France, people who practice mindfulness meditation in Hanh’s tradition are able to <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-miracle-of-mindfulness/\">see miracles everywhere</a>, because they recognize interbeing in daily life. Even commonplace activities can become special. </p>\n\n<p>When drinking tea at Plum Village, for example, meditators are encouraged to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dn9kqVrKzE\">drink your cloud</a>,” because the water in the tea was once a cloud that was once a river that will one day again fall from the sky as raindrops nourishing the apple trees. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Dn9kqVrKzE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Meditating with Thich Nhat Hahn.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A person is not (just) a person</h2>\n\n<p>The knowledge gained in meditation <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/interbeing-4th-edition/\">applies to people, too</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We as human beings are also interbeing. We are not separate from the world or each other. We are mutually interdependent. None of us would exist without rain, sunshine, food, a planet Earth – and the efforts of other people, including parents, neighbors, teachers, scientists, farmers and doctors. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A white scroll with the words, 'This moment is full of wonders.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706027/original/file-20251203-56-6v4e85.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Thich Nhat Hanh’s calligraphy, Plum Village, France.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Anna Sunderland Engels</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>A person is more than a single, solitary individual. <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo68657749.html\">We contain multitudes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Seen from this perspective, being a human is miraculous. Think of how the stars had to align so that each of us could be here today. Had the Earth been a little farther from the Sun, or one of our ancestors slipped and fallen down a cliff before their children were conceived, we wouldn’t be here at all. </p>\n\n<p>“People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is to walk on earth,” Hanh wrote in his book “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/the-miracle-of-mindfulness/\">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a>.” Each breath, each step, becomes a miracle in this practice of meditation.</p>\n\n<h2>Mindful democracy</h2>\n\n<p>Many of Hanh’s writings and talks <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/zen-and-the-art-of-saving-the-planet/\">were focused on drawing out the civic and ethical implications of interbeing</a>. He believed that a better, more just world is possible if people are committed to cultivating an awareness of “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/good-citizens/\">the interconnectedness of all things</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Everything is interdependent, so it’s not enough to focus on individual well-being while ignoring the well-being of others or the world. </p>\n\n<p>“With the insight of interbeing – that we are inherently interconnected with all other beings – we know that when other people suffer less, we suffer less. And when we suffer less, other people suffer less,” <a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/good-citizens/\">Hanh observed</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>As I explain in my new book, “<a href=\"https://www.parallax.org/product/on-mindful-democracy/\">On Mindful Democracy</a>,” to foreground interbeing changes democracy. </p>\n\n<p>It’s common today to talk about democracy as a partisan conflict and to interpret events through the lens of which party will win. </p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of interbeing, we are interdependent, so we all win, or we all lose, together. To practice meditation is to see that underneath our partisan disagreements, we are interconnected. I therefore define mindful democracy as the practice of caring for each other and for the miraculous life we share. </p>\n\n<p>Concretely, this means building welcoming, vibrant communities where people can meditate on interbeing together. It means learning to disagree – and still work together to reduce suffering – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-buddhism-can-teach-in-this-moment-of-deep-divisions-no-person-is-evil-only-mistaken-242575\">without turning each other into enemies</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Life is a shared project, and all of us benefit when we cooperate to ensure that there is less suffering, and more joy, in the world.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269919/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jeremy David Engels does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Because the symbols of Christmas are so widely recognizable, juxtaposing them with the sounds and values of more niche musical styles can have striking effects.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how genres like roots reggae, thrash metal and pop punk have added new layers to familiar holiday tropes:</p>\n\n<h2>A roots reggae Christmas revival</h2>\n\n<p>Certain sounds elicit certain expectations. </p>\n\n<p>If you hear <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-bells-to-choirs-different-timbres-ring-in-the-christmas-holiday-season-231926\">sleigh bells and a children’s choir</a>, lyrics about wintry fun can’t be far. If you hear off-beat reggae guitars and Jamaican accents, you’ll probably picture pot and palm trees, not Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>And yet the roots reggae sound of Jacob Miller’s “We Wish You A Irie Christmas” infuses the classic “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” <a href=\"https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/articles/rastafari-theology-reggae-music-and-postcolonial-legacy-bob-marley-juan-m-floyd\">with Rastafarian liberation theology</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Singers of the classic carol – which some historians <a href=\"https://hanfordsentinel.com/we-wish-you-a-merry-christmas/article_9b4ed4fb-9414-5b3d-aa00-7fe130b803d8.html\">trace to 16th-century England</a> – clamor for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figgy_pudding\">figgy pudding</a>, a traditional British Christmas dessert. They refuse to leave until they get their sweets: “We won’t go until we get some / So bring it out here!” </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, Miller’s Christmas is “<a href=\"https://jamaicanpatwah.com/term/Irie/1010\">irie</a>,” which, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/05/patwa-is-not-broken-english-the-african-ties-that-bind-us-and-caribbean-languages\">Jamaican Patois</a>, roughly translates to contentment and inner peace.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqNI9BWOXHA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jacob Miller’s 1978 recording ‘We Wish You A Irie Christmas’ critiques materialism.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In his version, Miller points out that poverty and joy are not mutually exclusive: “We rub it and dub it to the Christmas ‘pon a broke pocket this year.” He also stresses freedom from material desire: “Don’t kill nuf oneself to buy it all.” </p>\n\n<p>After all, the biblical Christmas in Bethlehem had no toys – and no snow either, just like the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>For Rastafarians like Miller, the renewal promised by Christmas was deeply personal. In the track, a word that sounds like “Ice-mas” is actually “I’s-mas.” In Rastafarianism, <a href=\"https://www.thecollector.com/iyaric-ini-rastafari/\">the “I” is the deity contained in each person</a>. Miller’s Christmas revelers dance to their own divinity, anticipating a return to the promised land. </p>\n\n<p>In doing so, Miller turns a simple, well-worn carol into an anthem of self-worth and liberation.</p>\n\n<h2>Thrash metal Christmas horror</h2>\n\n<p>Other genres can recast an innocent carol’s lyrics into a horror story. </p>\n\n<p>The 19th-century German carol “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_0dQ0jToSQ\">Kling, Glöckchen, Klingelingeling</a>” was written from the perspective of the “Christkind,” a Christmas gift-bringer in parts of Europe and South America. This “little Jesus” brings gifts in countries where <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/this-christmas-tell-your-children-the-real-santa-claus-story-107424\">Santa Claus</a> isn’t part of holiday traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Each stanza is framed by a melody and words that evoke the sounds of a ringing bell, which are reflected in the title. In the carol, the Christkind implores children to let it inside so it doesn’t freeze to death. Next, the Christkind promises gifts in return for being let into the living room. Finally, the Christkind asks the children to open their hearts to it.</p>\n\n<p>Who could corrupt this child-friendly pitch for piety? </p>\n\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/sodoms-thomas-angelripper-wants-war-to-end/\">Thomas “Angelripper” Such</a>, a former coal miner and the front man of the German thrash metal band Sodom. </p>\n\n<p>Where earlier heavy metal could be <a href=\"https://www.revenantjournal.com/contents/raising-the-devil-horns-coven-and-the-occults-influence-on-the-development-of-metal-music/\">gloomy and occult</a>, Sodom raised the temperature even more with gory, blasphemous lyrics, <a href=\"https://www.loudersound.com/features/german-thrash-kreator-destruction-tankard-holy-moses\">buzzsaw guitars and snarled screams</a>. Sodom’s side project, Onkel Tom Angelripper, has recorded metal versions of popular German songs, including “Kling, Glöckchen, Klingelingeling.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GBKxRtc3zY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Things take an ominous turn in Onkel Tom Angelripper’s version of the German Christmas classic ‘Kling, Glöckchen, Klingelingeling.’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Without changing the lyrics, the thrash metal sound transforms the carol’s wholesomeness into horror. A twee wind arrangement is cut off by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19401159.2022.2109358\">heavy, distorted guitars</a> and a growled “Kling.” Metal musicians often use these sounds to <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/10894/chapter-abstract/159129982\">evoke feelings of danger</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Angelripper’s caroler sounds more like a large predator who manipulates and bribes his way into a home. In this framing, the final stanza’s line – “open your hearts to me!” – sounds less like a call for communion and more like an ominous threat of mutilation. It’s a home invasion akin to that in the classic Christmas movie “Home Alone,” but it’s all terror, no humor.</p>\n\n<p>This musical corruption of ambiguous lyrics lays bare the fragility of festive innocence.</p>\n\n<h2>Christmas grief gets the punk treatment</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a whole catalog of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/eighteen-sad-christmas-songs-that-will-help-you-ease-the-festive-blues-244980\">melancholic Christmas songs</a>, from Elvis Presley’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6WnnZRSKYs\">Blue Christmas</a>” to Bing Crosby’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgaynmY4BNM\">I’ll Be Home for Christmas</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But few touch on painful themes of substance abuse, suicide and guilt like the raw-yet-catchy “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGba4Y6tnhg\">Christmas Vacation</a>” by pop-punk pioneers the Descendents.</p>\n\n<p>For better or worse, many of the Descendents’ songs are unabashedly immature, petulant and sometimes offensive. Yet their boyish bravado puts moments of vulnerability into relief. </p>\n\n<p>“Christmas Vacation” is no different. </p>\n\n<p>Over jangly guitars and sparse bass, front man Milo Aukerman recalls an alcoholic friend or partner who “took a vacation into oblivion.” And while this turn of events wasn’t a surprise to the narrator, that didn’t change anything: “I knew about your plans / I really did understand / But you didn’t let me know / I wasn’t invited to go.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRtpx9VVTJc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The Descendents’ 1985 track ‘Christmas Vacation’ is about loss and longing.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The lyrics portray a process of ongoing grief. What makes “Christmas Vacation” poignant is its lyrical vacillation. The narrator wonders: Did she leave forever? Will she be back? Is she to blame? Am I? </p>\n\n<p>The vocal harmony in the chorus – a pop punk staple – mirrors this ambivalence. In the track, the joining of voices starts to sound like a wail. An expected feature of pop punk is transformed into a moving expression of grief and loneliness: a common, less celebrated, holiday experience.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than sneer at or mock Christmas, these three tracks give voice to the complicated emotions that can accompany the holidays. Miller evokes gratitude and hope; Angelripper provokes fear and vulnerability; the Descendents dwell on grief and longing. And all three perspectives end up complementing the focus of mainstream music on food, fancy gifts, snow and family.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270751/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Florian Walch does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It was a little below freezing as we got moving at 1:30 a.m., and the Moon illuminated the snowy mountaintops above us.  </p>\n\n<p>Our packs were a bit heavier than normal because we were hauling highly accurate surveying equipment to the summits of two peaks, each over 14,000 feet (4,267.2 meters). The peaks, <a href=\"https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5908\">Crestone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5907\">East Crestone</a>, were close enough in height, with a short enough saddle in between, that only the taller of the two would count as a true 14er and the other as a sub-peak. </p>\n\n<p>Crestone had traditionally been thought to be taller and sees hundreds of ascents each year. East Crestone, traditionally believed to be shorter, sees only a fraction as many ascents. Colorado has 58 mountain peaks over 14,000 feet that peakbaggers consider 14ers. For locals and visitors alike, <a href=\"https://www.uncovercolorado.com/colorado-14ers-list/\">bagging a 14er is a sport</a>, and some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ddh45/i_climbed_all_58_of_the_14ers_14000ft4270m_peaks/\">people post reports about having climbed</a> all 58.   </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to measure which was taller, since I suspected previous measurements people had trusted for years might be erroneous.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man stands near a tripod at the top of a mountain.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=452&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=452&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=452&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=568&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=568&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702744/original/file-20251117-56-h9xi8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=568&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">GPS allows Eric Gilbertson to measure the peaks of Crestone and East Crestone in Colorado in October 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Eric Gilbertson</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l4_TGzMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">teach mountain surveying</a>, and I climb and research mountains around the world for fun.

To get accurate surveying equipment to the summits requires ingenuity and specialized gear. Equipment needs to be as light as possible and adaptable to tricky terrain. For these reasons, very few mountains have been surveyed to the level of accuracy I can attain. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, measurements have generally been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acYGPtn77CI&amp;t=5s\">made from a distance with theodolites</a>. These are mechanical devices that can measure an angle up to a mountain summit very accurately. The distance to the mountain can be measured by other means, and trigonometry can be used with the distance and angle to calculate the summit elevation. But if the measurement is taken too far away, the error in elevation can be high. Theodolites are heavy and not easy to carry close to a peak.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An illustration shows how a theodolite measures angles.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=265&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=265&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=265&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=334&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=334&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703968/original/file-20251122-56-r4qgau.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=334&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Schematic diagram of how a theodolite is used to measure an angle to the summit of a mountain.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Eric Gilbertson</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I sometimes carry a 30-pound (13.61 kg) theodolite to a summit, but if the mountain is technical, this is challenging and requires complicated rope systems to haul it up.

The GPS requires an hour or more to get an accurate measurement, so it wouldn’t make sense timewise to measure many nearby points with this device.

In this case, I strap on hiking poles to extend the legs. Another solution is to use a tripod with flexible legs, and I mold the legs to conform to the shape of a sharp boulder. This is what I used to <a href=\"https://americanalpineclub.org/news/2024/8/19/the-line-the-monthly-newsletter-of-the-aaj\">measure the high point of Uzbekistan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another tool I use is <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-lidar-data-and-where-can-i-download-it\">LiDAR, which stands for light detection and ranging</a>. This works by an airplane flying over a mountain and bouncing light signals off the summit. By using the plane’s location and the time it takes the signal to bounce back, the mountain’s elevation can be calculated. </p>\n\n<h2>Colorado 14ers</h2>\n\n<p>All measurements can have errors. I traveled to Colorado because I suspected LiDAR measurements of Crestone Peak, considered a 14er, might be erroneous. LiDAR measurements have been taken for nearly all mountains in Colorado, and these measurements are generally the most accurate available for mountain elevations. </p>\n\n<p>LiDAR measurements hit the ground every few feet of horizontal spacing and can miss the top of sharp summits, leading to an underestimate of summit height. They can also hit things such as bushes, leading to an overestimate of summit height.</p>\n\n<p>LiDAR data showed Crestone Peak and East Crestone <a href=\"https://www.14ers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=61035&amp;start=252\">within a few feet of the same height</a>. But, interestingly, it showed a 3-4 foot (0.9-1.2 meter) spike on the top of Crestone. I climbed Crestone in 2020 <a href=\"https://fastestknowntime.com/article/fktoy-na-2020-winners-announced-pt-1\">while doing the Rocky Mountain Slam</a>, a challenge to climb all the Colorado 14ers, Wyoming 13ers and Montana 12ers in two months, and knew the summit was pretty flat. I speculated that spike could have easily been a person, which meant the LiDAR elevation of Crestone might be too high.</p>\n\n<p>East Crestone has a sharp boulder on the summit, which LiDAR could easily miss because of the horizontal gaps between measurements. So that elevation was possibly too short. In Colorado a point needs 300 feet (91.44 meters) of prominence to <a href=\"https://www.14ers.com/info_peak.php\">count as a separate peak</a>. Other states have different rules, like <a href=\"https://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8039293\">in Washington where 400 feet (121.92 meters) is required</a>. Prominence is a measure of how high a peak sticks up above a saddle connecting it to a taller peak. The saddle between Crestone and East Crestone is short enough that only the taller of them is a true peak and the other is a sub-peak. </p>\n\n<p>On East Crestone I first set up a tall tripod, but the wind blew it down, nearly over a cliff. I switched it out with a shorter one, which was more stable. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a green jacket sits near a device on a tripod on the top of a mountain.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702751/original/file-20251117-56-csp20w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Eric Gilbertson hiked Crestone, one of Colorado’s 14ers, to determine its true height.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Elijah Gendron</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I then scrambled over to Crestone Peak and mounted another identical GPS device.

The universe teems with huge, spectacular objects, and it might seem like these massive objects should hold most of the universe’s matter.</p>\n\n<p>But the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7809624\">Big Bang theory</a> predicts that about 5% of the universe’s contents should be atoms made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Most of those atoms cannot be found in stars and galaxies – a discrepancy that has puzzled astronomers. </p>\n\n<p>If not in visible stars and galaxies, the most likely hiding place for the matter is in the dark space between galaxies. While space is often referred to as a vacuum, it isn’t completely empty. Individual particles and atoms are dispersed throughout the space between stars and galaxies, forming a dark, filamentary network called the “<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1017/S1743921307013956\">cosmic web</a>.”  </p>\n\n<p>Throughout <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OrRLRQ4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">my career as an astronomer</a>, I’ve studied this cosmic web, and I know how difficult it is to account for the matter spread throughout space.</p>\n\n<p>In a study published in June 2025, a team of scientists used a unique radio technique to complete the census of normal matter in the universe.</p>\n\n<h2>The census of normal matter</h2>\n\n<p>The most obvious place to look for normal matter is in the form of stars. Gravity <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/the-universe/galaxies/formation-and-evolution-of-galaxies\">gathers stars together into galaxies</a>, and astronomers can count galaxies throughout the observable universe. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/how-many-atoms-in-universe.html\">The census</a> comes to several hundred billion galaxies, each made of several hundred billion stars. The numbers are uncertain because many stars lurk <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2014.16288\">outside of galaxies</a>. That’s an estimated 10<sup>23</sup> stars in the universe, or hundreds of times more than the number of <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-stars-outnumber-the-sands-of-earths-beaches/\">sand grains</a> on all of Earth’s beaches. There are an estimated <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/how-many-atoms-in-universe.html\">10<sup>82</sup> atoms in the universe</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, this prodigious number falls far short of accounting for all the matter predicted by the Big Bang. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae2485\">Careful accounting</a> indicates that stars contain only 0.5% of the matter in the universe. Ten times more atoms are presumably floating freely in space. Just 0.03% of the matter is <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Chemical+Composition#:%7E:text=The%20chemical%20composition%20of%20the,composition%20of%20the%20solar%20neighbourhood:\">elements other than hydrogen and helium</a>, including carbon and all the building blocks of life.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking between galaxies</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/intergalactic-medium\">intergalactic medium</a> – the space between galaxies – is near-total vacuum, with a density of one atom per cubic meter, or one atom every 35 cubic feet. That’s less than a billionth of a billionth of the density of air on Earth. Even at this very low density, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-space-made-of-an-astrophysics-expert-explains-all-the-components-from-radiation-to-dark-matter-found-in-the-vacuum-of-space-235402\">this diffuse medium</a> adds up to a lot of matter, given the enormous, 92-billion-light-year <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/how-large-universe/\">diameter of the universe</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The intergalactic medium is <a href=\"https://www.space.com/what-happens-in-intergalactic-space.html\">very hot</a>, with a temperature of millions of degrees. That makes it difficult to observe except with <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-11-quantification-intergalactic-medium-cosmic-filaments.html#google_vignette\">X-ray telescopes</a>, since very hot gas radiates out through the universe at <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/\">very short X-ray wavelengths</a>. X-ray telescopes have limited sensitivity because they are smaller than most optical telescopes. </p>\n\n<h2>Deploying a new tool</h2>\n\n<p>Astronomers recently used a new tool to solve this missing matter problem. <a href=\"https://www.space.com/fast-radio-bursts\">Fast radio bursts</a> are intense blasts of radio waves that can put out as much energy in a millisecond as the Sun puts out in three days. First discovered in 2007, scientists found that the bursts are caused by compact stellar remnants in distant galaxies. Their energy peters out as the bursts travel through space, and by the time that energy reaches the Earth, it is a thousand times weaker than a mobile phone signal would be if emitted on the Moon, then detected on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>Research from early 2025 suggests the <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-scientists-pin-down-origins-fast-radio-burst-0101\">source of the bursts</a> is the highly magnetic region around an ultra-compact neutron star. <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/03/What_is_a_neutron_star\">Neutron stars</a> are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity after a supernova explosion. The particular type of neutron star that emits radio bursts is <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Magnetar\">called a magnetar</a>, with a magnetic field a thousand trillion times stronger than the Earth’s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of a bright star with circular rings around it representing magnetic field lines\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703719/original/file-20251120-56-62ufhm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A magnetar is a rare type of neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1415a/\">ESO/L.

As the bursts travel through space, interactions with electrons in the hot intergalactic gas preferentially slow down longer wavelengths. The radio signal is spread out, analogous to the way a prism turns sunlight into a rainbow. Astronomers use the amount of spreading to calculate how much gas the burst has passed through on its way to Earth.</p>\n\n<h2>Puzzle solved</h2>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02566-y\">new study</a>, published in June 2025, a team of astronomers from Caltech and the Harvard Center for Astrophysics studied 69 fast radio bursts using an array of 110 radio telescopes in California. The team found that <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/missing-matter-in-universe-found\">76% of the universe’s normal matter</a> lies in the space between galaxies, with another 15% in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/galactic-halo\">galaxy halos</a> – the area surrounding the visible stars in a galaxy – and the remaining 9% in stars and cold gas within galaxies.</p>\n\n<p>The complete accounting of normal matter in the universe provides a strong affirmation of the Big Bang theory. The theory predicts the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/big-bang-nucleosynthesis\">abundance of normal matter</a> formed in the first few minutes of the universe, so by recovering the predicted 5%, the theory passes a critical test.</p>\n\n<p>Several thousand fast radio bursts have already been observed, and an <a href=\"https://www.deepsynoptic.org/overview\">upcoming array of radio telescopes</a> will likely increase the discovery rate to 10,000 per year. Such a large sample will let fast radio bursts become powerful <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abj3043\">tools for cosmology</a>. <a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/cosmology\">Cosmology</a> is the study of the size, shape and evolution of the universe. Radio bursts could go beyond counting atoms to <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/mapping-the-cosmic-web/\">mapping the three-dimensional structure</a> of the cosmic web.</p>\n\n<h2>Pie chart of the universe</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists may now have the complete picture of where normal matter is distributed, but most of the universe is still made up of stuff they don’t fully understand.</p>\n\n<p>The most abundant ingredients in the universe are dark matter and dark energy, both of which are poorly understood. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dark-energy/\">Dark energy</a> is causing the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-universe-expanding-into-if-its-already-infinite-239702\">accelerating expansion of the universe</a>, and <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dark-matter/\">dark matter</a> is the invisible glue that holds galaxies and the universe together. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702373/original/file-20251113-66-n5qu4t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pie chart showing the composition of the universe.

To come up with this finding, my colleagues and I developed a method that let us <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu5584\">alter the ranking of people’s feeds</a>, previously something only the social media companies could do.</p>\n\n<p>Reranking social media feeds to reduce exposure to posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity affected people’s emotions and their views of people with opposing political views.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=hj-gvXIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">computer scientist</a> who studies social computing, artificial intelligence and the web. Because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aec7388\">only social media platforms</a> can modify their algorithms, we developed and released an open-source web tool that allowed us to rerank the feeds of consenting participants on X, formerly Twitter, in real time. </p>\n\n<p>Drawing on social science theory, we used a large language model to identify posts likely to polarize people, such as those advocating political violence or calling for the imprisonment of members of the opposing party. These posts were not removed; they were simply ranked lower, requiring users to scroll further to see them. This reduced the number of those posts users saw.</p>\n\n<p>We ran this experiment for 10 days in the weeks before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. We found that reducing exposure to polarizing content measurably improved participants’ feelings toward people from the opposing party and reduced their negative emotions while scrolling their feed. Importantly, these effects were similar across political affiliations, suggesting that the intervention benefits users regardless of their political party.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLfr7sU5W2E?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">This ‘60 Minutes’ segment covers how divisive social media posts get more traction than neutral posts.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>A common misconception is that people must choose between two extremes: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testified-that-the-companys-algorithms-are-dangerous-heres-how-they-can-manipulate-you-169420\">engagement-based algorithms</a> or purely chronological feeds. In reality, there is a wide spectrum of intermediate approaches depending on what they are optimized to do. </p>\n\n<p>Feed algorithms are typically optimized to capture your attention, and as a result, they have a significant impact on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916231185057\">your attitudes, moods and perceptions of others</a>. For this reason, there is an urgent need for frameworks that enable independent researchers to test new approaches under realistic conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Our work offers a path forward, showing how researchers can study and prototype alternative algorithms at scale, and it demonstrates that, thanks to large language models, platforms finally have the technical means to detect polarizing content that can affect their users’ democratic attitudes.</p>\n\n<h2>What other research is being done in this field</h2>\n\n<p>Testing the impact of alternative feed algorithms on live platforms is difficult, and such studies have only recently increased in number. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abp9364\">recent collaboration</a> between academics and Meta found that changing the algorithmic feed to a chronological one was not sufficient to show an impact on polarization. A related effort, the <a href=\"https://humancompatible.ai/news/2024/01/18/the-prosocial-ranking-challenge-60000-in-prizes-for-better-social-media-algorithms/\">Prosocial Ranking Challenge</a> led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, explores ranking alternatives across multiple platforms to promote beneficial social outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the progress in large language model development enables richer ways to model how people think, feel and interact with others. We are seeing growing interest in giving users more control, allowing people to decide what principles should guide what they see in their feeds – for example the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.10839\">Alexandria library of pluralistic values</a> and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.10776\">Bonsai feed reranking system</a>. Social media platforms, including <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds\">Bluesky</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1969081066578149547\">X</a>, are heading this way, as well.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>This study represents our first step toward designing algorithms that are aware of their potential social impact. Many questions remain open. </p>\n\n<p>We plan to investigate the long-term effects of these interventions and test new ranking objectives to address other risks to online well-being, such as mental health and life satisfaction. Future work will explore how to balance multiple goals, such as cultural context, personal values and user control, to create online spaces that better support healthy social and civic interaction.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271071/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>This research was partially supported by a Hoffman-Yee grant from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.</span></em></p>",

That’s the key finding from my new research published in the Journal of Marketing Research, where I analyzed thousands of TED Talks and ran controlled experiments to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437251385922\">examine how gestures shape communication</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Talking with your hands</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re giving a presentation, pitching an idea or leading a meeting, you probably spend most of your prep time thinking about what you’ll say. But what about the ways you’ll move your hands?</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in Italy, where gesturing is practically a second language. Now that I live in the United States, I’ve become acutely aware of how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001862\">cultures differ in how, and how much</a>, people move their hands when they talk. Still, across contexts and cultures, one thing is constant: People do talk with their hands.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1s3844AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">someone who studies communication</a>, I’d noticed how some speakers seemed instantly clearer when they gestured. This made me wonder: Do gestures actually make communicators more effective?</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is yes, but only when the gestures visually represent the idea you’re talking about. Researchers call these movements “<a href=\"https://www.paulekman.com/nonverbal-communication/types-of-gestures/\">illustrators</a>.” For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When talking about distance, you might spread your hands apart while saying something is “farther away.”</li>\n<li>When explaining how two concepts relate, you might bring your hands together while saying “these ideas fit together.”</li>\n<li>When describing how the market demand “is going up and down,” you could visually depict a wave shape with your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man speaking holds his hands apart\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=349&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=439&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=439&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704007/original/file-20251122-66-lq1b5v.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=439&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One video included in the study provides an example of a TED speaker on stage gesturing as he presents his talk.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://youtu.be/IRxgDMSp9Gs?si=Su8K_DUkbCPQ0wZB\">YouTube/TED – David Agus: A new strategy in the war against cancer</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437251385922\">To study gestures at scale</a>, my team and I analyzed 200,000 video segments from more than 2,000 TED Talks using AI tools that can detect and classify hand gestures frame by frame. We paired this with controlled experiments in which our study participants evaluated entrepreneurs pitching a product.</p>\n\n<p>The same pattern of results appeared in both settings. In the AI-analyzed TED Talk data, illustrative gestures predicted higher audience evaluations, reflected in more than 33 million online “likes” of the videos. And in our experiments, 1,600 participants rated speakers who used illustrative gestures as more clear, competent and persuasive.</p>\n\n<h2>How hands can help get your point across</h2>\n\n<p>What I found is that these gestures give listeners a visual shortcut to your meaning. They make abstract ideas feel more concrete, helping listeners build a mental picture of what you’re saying. This makes the message feel easier to process – a phenomenon psychologists call “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868309341564\">processing fluency</a>.” And we found that when ideas feel easier to grasp, people tend to see the speaker as more competent and persuasive.</p>\n\n<p>But not all gestures help. Movements that don’t match the message – like random waving, fidgeting or pointing to things in the space – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437251385922\">offer no such benefit</a>. In some cases, they can even distract.</p>\n\n<p>A practical takeaway: Focus on clarity over choreography. Think about where your hands naturally illustrate what you’re saying – emphasizing size, direction or emotion – and let them move with purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Your hands aren’t just accessories to your words. They can be a powerful tool to make your ideas resonate.</p>\n\n<p>I’m now investigating whether people can learn to gesture better – almost like developing a nonverbal vocabulary. Early pilot tests are promising: Even a 5-minute training session helps people become clearer and more effective through the use of appropriate hand gestures.</p>\n\n<p>While my research examined how individual gestures work together with spoken language, the next step is to understand what makes a communicator effective <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4580994\">with their voice</a> and, ultimately, across all the channels they use to communicate – how gestures combine with voice, facial expressions and body movement. I’m now exploring AI tools that track all these channels at once so I can identify the patterns, not just the isolated gestures, that make speakers more effective communicators.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270352/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Giovanni Luca Cascio Rizzo does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The visit was a fruitful one: The West African nation reopened its Iranian embassy, finalized <a href=\"https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/520367/Burkina-Faso-seeks-Iran-s-expertise-in-combating-drugs\">new agreements on security cooperation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/520367/Burkina-Faso-seeks-Iran-s-expertise-in-combating-drugs\">held discussions</a> about strengthening relations in agriculture and industry. </p>\n\n<p>Far from being a routine bilateral diplomatic event for both countries, the trip was part of a broader trend. Since the onset of war in Gaza in late 2023, sparked by the Tehran-aligned and -funded Palestinian group Hamas, Iran has found itself increasingly isolated and facing a number of political and economic crises. Internationally, Tehran’s network of proxy nonstate groups across the Middle East, its so-called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-irans-axis-of-resistance-and-why-is-it-uniting-in-fury-against-the-us-and-israel-222281\">axis of resistance</a>, was stretched to a breaking point with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/israel-has-promised-basic-amount-of-food-into-gaza-but-its-policies-have-already-created-catastrophic-starvation-risk-for-millions-257181\">Israel’s brutal campaigns</a> against Hamas <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-year-on-the-israeli-lebanese-ceasefire-looks-increasingly-fragile-could-a-return-to-cyclical-violence-come-next-270423\">and Hezbollah</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/\">fall of the Assad regime in Syria</a> in late 2024. </p>\n\n<p>Tehran’s regional difficulties then culminated with a <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">punishing 12-day war with Israel in June 2025</a>, which the United States joined, and the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/09/29/iran-sanctions-snapback-council-reimposes-restrictive-measures/\">subsequent EU-imposed U.N. “snapback” sanctions</a> – a series of penalties against Iran that were initially lifted after it signed a deal in 2015 limiting Tehran’s nuclear program in return for the easing of sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, Iran is now facing an <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/11/iran-water-crisis-warning-climate?lang=en\">environmental crisis</a> in the shape of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/irans-president-calls-for-moving-its-drought-stricken-capital-amid-a-worsening-water-crisis-how-tehran-got-into-water-bankruptcy-270456\">severe drought affecting the capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As Iranian officials attempt to weather this rocky new reality, they have looked to advance geostrategic interests elsewhere. As <a href=\"https://pir.fiu.edu//faculty-a-z/eric-lob1/eric-lob.html\">an expert on Iran’s foreign policy</a>, I believe one key emergent area for this is Africa, where Iran has increased its outreach to historically dependable and strategically significant partners such as Burkina Faso. This outreach has created important opportunities for Tehran to engage with countries on issues such as security and critical minerals, while also expanding its market for weapons and other exports while bypassing sanctions.</p>\n\n<h2>Security, uranium and economy in West Africa</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to Burkina Faso, Iran has intensified its outreach to other African countries in West Africa and the Sahel region, such as Mali and Niger. </p>\n\n<p>Since the early 2020s, <a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/2023/iran-sees-potential-gain-in-loss-of-western-influence-in-the-sahel/\">these countries have experienced</a> military coups and distanced themselves from the West. They have also confronted serious security threats from rebels, militias and jihadists. Consequently, and as was the case with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/iran-and-ethiopia-have-a-security-deal-heres-why-they-signed-it-256486\">Ethiopia</a>, they have looked toward Iran as a security partner and a potential supplier of arms, drones and other equipment.</p>\n\n<p>For Iran, expanding relations with these African countries holds the benefit of opening up economically critical markets, including metals and minerals. For instance, Tehran <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/what-to-expect-from-irans-approach-to-africa-after-its-war-with-israel/\">has aspired to access</a> gold from Burkina Faso and Mali, and uranium from Niger. Depending on the extent of the damage and destruction to Iran’s nuclear program during the 12-day war, the potential uranium procured from these countries could be particularly critical if Iran decides to reconstitute or weaponize its program.</p>\n\n<p>After the Iranian and Malian <a href=\"https://en.mfa.ir/portal/newsview/744625/Iran-Mali-FMs-stress-promotion-of-bilateral-relations\">foreign ministers met</a> in May 2024, they did so again the following year <a href=\"https://en.mehrnews.com/news/237768/Iran-Mali-FMs-discuss-expansion-of-bilateral-ties\">in October to discuss</a> reinforcing bilateral and multilateral relations. </p>\n\n<p>To this end, both nations agreed to hold a joint economic commission and to show solidarity and support at meetings of international organizations such as the U.N. and the <a href=\"https://nam.go.ug/history\">Non-Aligned Movement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in April and May 2025, Iran and Niger <a href=\"https://en.irna.ir/news/85818103/Iran-and-Niger-sign-cooperation-document\">signed economic</a> and <a href=\"https://westafricaweekly.com/niger-and-iran-sign-security-cooperation-agreement-to-combat-transnational-threats/\">security agreements</a> after earlier <a href=\"https://rasanah-iiis.org/english/monitoring-and-translation/reports/irans-uranium-deal-with-niger-a-us-iran-face-off-in-a-new-arena/\">inking a deal</a> by which Tehran would <a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202405319613\">acquire 300 tons of uranium</a> for US$56 million. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man gives a speech at a conference.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706132/original/file-20251203-64-w3t9of.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi delivers a speech at the 51st meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on June 22, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/iranian-foreign-minister-abbas-araghchi-delivers-a-speech-news-photo/2220703454\">Elif Ozturk / Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>From February to October, Iran also looked to deepen diplomatic relations with Sierra Leone by <a href=\"https://freetown.mfa.ir/en/NewsView/765658\">holding bilateral meetings</a> with the West African nation. Apart from attempting to access uranium, Tehran <a href=\"https://sierraleone.mfa.gov.ir/en/newsview/761259\">sought Sierra Leone’s support in multilateral institutions</a> such as the U.N. and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. </p>\n\n<p>That said, Sierra Leone, while <a href=\"https://ayvnews.com/iran-seeks-stronger-bilateral-ties-with-sierra-leoneincluding-a-political-committee-and-visa-free-travel/\">serving as a nonpermanent member</a> of the U.N.

At the time, the South African army chief, Gen. Rudzani Maphwanya, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62n9yrynjyo\">made statements supporting Iran</a> and criticizing Israel that created controversy. Between April and October, Iran held meetings and signed agreements with Zimbabwe in the <a href=\"https://president.ir/en/158796\">areas of economy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/516162/Zimbabwe-interested-in-boosting-environmental-ties-with-Iran\">the environment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.heraldonline.co.zw/iran-zimbabwe-ties-strengthen-through-medical-tourism-opportunities/\">medical tourism</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While attending the Non-Aligned Movement’s meeting of foreign ministers in Kampala in October, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi <a href=\"https://en.mfa.ir/portal/newsview/776713/Iranian-FM-meets-Ugandan-President\">met with Ugandan President</a> Yoweri Museveni and thanked him for Uganda’s condemnation of the U.S. and Israel during the 12-day war, during which Uganda <a href=\"https://opm.go.ug/premier-nabbanja-receives-evacuated-ugandans-from-iran/\">evacuated 41 students</a> from Iran. Araghchi also expressed Tehran’s interest and intent on strengthening cooperation with Kampala in agriculture, the economy and commerce. </p>\n\n<p>For Iran, Uganda is strategically important because it possesses not only uranium but also cobalt, which is used to manufacture lithium batteries, superalloys and other industrial products. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a suit sits at a conference.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706134/original/file-20251203-56-sib28a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Iran’s strategic conundrum has only worsened after numerous foreign and domestic challenges.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/iranian-foreign-minister-abbas-araghchi-attends-during-the-news-photo/2220480863\">Arif Hudaverdi Yaman/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How Iran is still constrained</h2>\n\n<p>While Iran has increased its outreach to reliable and significant African partners across the continent, it has encountered a number of consequential constraints. </p>\n\n<p>For one, there continues to be extensive trade competition from Iran’s Middle East rivals. As recently as 2023, the United Arab Emirates <a href=\"https://oec.world/en\">was a top export partner</a> for Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Uganda and Zimbabwe, as well as a top import partner of Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zimbabwe. As it had done with several countries in the Horn of Africa in 2016, the UAE, alongside Saudi Arabia, could pressure others on the continent to reduce or eliminate their engagement with Tehran.</p>\n\n<p>Particularly with the U.N. snapback sanctions now back in place, the ongoing reality of global economic pressure on Iran could also give African countries pause when considering stronger bilateral ties with Tehran. Yet before then, and even with the U.S. reimposing sanctions on Tehran after <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/donald-trump-iran-deal-announcement-decision\">withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018</a>, these countries did not simply stop engaging with Tehran. </p>\n\n<p>The final constraint is the transactional nature of Iran’s outreach. This could create distrust among its African partners. In November 2025, for instance, Tehran reportedly <a href=\"https://hornreview.org/2025/11/12/irans-drone-supply-network-to-eritrea-and-ethiopias-national-security-imperative/\">supplied drones to Eritrea</a> as tensions escalated between it and Ethiopia. Such a move by Iran could complicate its relationship with Ethiopia and put Tehran in the middle of another conflict between those countries.</p>\n\n<p>Time will tell whether the opportunities outweigh the constraints as Iran attempts to forge closer relations with the continent. Yet for government officials in Tehran weathering sundry crises at home and abroad, it will feel like they have few alternatives than to seek opportunities where they can find them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270603/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eric Lob receives funding from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Mamdani claims that his campaign had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats\">over 100,000 volunteers</a> knocking on doors across New York City. </p>\n\n<p>This focus on <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/30/zohran-mamdani-supporters-make-final-campaign-push-why-him-why-now\">on-the-ground mobilization</a> stands out given the increasing attention devoted to online campaigning over the past 15 years. </p>\n\n<p>Particularly during that time period, online platforms have been a major focus of political campaigns and campaign research. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.51685/jqd.2024.010\">Targeted advertising</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.993679\">new media strategies</a> are increasingly viewed as central to campaign success. So is coverage of the campaign by <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/words-that-matter/#:%7E:text=How%20the%202016%20news%20media,journalists%20and%20to%20the%20public.\">legacy and social media</a> more generally. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, solid empirical evidence of the effectiveness of door-to-door canvassing is limited. Recent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055417000363\">work</a> finds very few effects of in-person canvassing, except in very specific circumstances. One recent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2023.102043\">paper</a> suggests that door-to-door canvassing by the candidate can make a difference to election outcomes. But in a race in New York City, it is not likely that Mamdani himself was able to reach enough voters to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>How much did Mamdani’s ground game contribute to his victory? As a <a href=\"https://www.snsoroka.com/\">political communication scholar</a>, I know that assessing the impact of different methods used by political campaigns is difficult – in part because political campaigns include multiple lines of communication. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"TiktokEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@zohran_k_mamdani/video/7541799146538208542&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>‘Hybrid’ campaigns</h2>\n\n<p>No campaign exists in isolation — nearly every candidate’s campaign occurs alongside opposing candidates’ campaigns. The effects of one campaign are often <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163635/the-gamble?srsltid=AfmBOorNSz7v3TRGFh0r1reQY55qhizlSh8gIWxi6oMqO62D4P_1wTtf\">masked</a> by the countering effects of the other. </p>\n\n<p>The size of a campaign on one platform also tends to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00291.x\">correlated</a> with the size of that candidate’s campaign on other platforms. When television advertising increases alongside social media advertising and door-to-door canvassing, identifying the effects of any single platform can be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Clever research designs are in some instances able to identify effects. These generally find that the impact of not just <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055417000363\">door-knocking</a> but also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc4046\">ads</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S11109-013-9239-Z\">online advertising</a> can be relatively limited.</p>\n\n<p>In the modern technological environment, the impact of any single aspect of a campaign may be especially difficult to assess. Campaigning increasingly occurs in what researchers have called a “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hybrid_Media_System/AXAuDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">hybrid media</a>” environment. Campaigns are waged in person, on the news and across multiple social media.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Each of these platforms comes with different advantages and disadvantages. Each also prioritizes different kinds of information.</p>\n\n<p>Plainly stating your policy platform may work for coverage of a campaign stop on the evening news. But if you want that policy to go viral on TikTok, then you may need to add a dance – <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/zohran-mamdanis-private-influencer-briefing-rcna240260\">or an influencer</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Find volunteers online, send them knocking</h2>\n\n<p>Candidates have increasingly recognized the need to tailor messages for different communication platforms, such as television ads, Facebook posts and TikToks, building <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2021.817285\">hybrid campaigns</a> that attempt to spread a message across multiple, different spaces. </p>\n\n<p>This interactivity across platforms has been especially evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats\">postelection assessments</a> of the Mamdani campaign. His social media campaign was adept at producing the kinds of content that attract attention online. That campaign also appears to have been able to convert online engagement into real-world activism, including door-to-door canvassing. </p>\n\n<p>There have been growing concerns among academics and campaign organizers about “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/hqx008\">slacktivism</a>” — activism that amounts to one or two clicks online but nothing more. One worry is that a quick online endorsement may in some instances give people a sense that they have done their share and limit more active forms of engagement. The Mamdani campaign appears to have overcome this problem, at least in part. </p>\n\n<p>But 100,000 people knocking on doors probably does not happen without the success of an online campaign. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQk2g-dDpum/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Finding and mobilizing campaigners</a> was one important focus of Mamdani’s engagement online, after all. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQaVV2wDste&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Do it yourself − then repeat on socials</h2>\n\n<p>In-person campaigning by Mamdani, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQnJj-RjlnA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">on the street</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQk2g-dDpum/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">in the taxi line</a>, is almost certainly made more effective through circulation on Instagram and TikTok. </p>\n\n<p>Using mass media to broadcast campaign stops is not new, of course. </p>\n\n<p>The construction of campaign stops that produce good social media content is becoming more common, however. The ways in which campaigns unfold in person are increasingly intertwined with the way they unfold online. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, the Mamdani campaign may have been a textbook example of a modern hybrid campaign and an illustration of the coevolution of digital and on-the-ground campaigning.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, the success of the Mamdani campaign is probably not about his online presence or his ground game, but both at the same time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269693/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stuart Soroka research has been funded from the National Science Foundation and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</span></em></p>",

Many of the nation’s greatest leaders have praised and memorialized its rhetoric and ideas in the promotion of their own.</p>\n\n<h2>Inalienable rights?</h2>\n\n<p>During the turbulent 1850s, the divisive issue of <a href=\"https://www.americanyawp.com/text/13-the-sectional-crisis/\">slavery permeated every facet of American life</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2023/02/escaping-slavery-the-consquences-of-the-fugitive-slave-act-of-1850/\">challenged basic precepts of American freedom</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In his 1852 speech “<a href=\"https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1852FrederickDouglass.pdf\">What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?</a>” <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/frederick-douglass-july-4th-and-remembering-babylon-in-america-79246\">Frederick Douglass</a>, the formerly enslaved abolitionist, used the declaration to set a standard for American society. As a Black American, Douglass insisted he was “not included within the pale” who enjoyed the “inalienable rights” articulated in the declaration.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the “great principles of the Declaration” gave Douglass hope and cause for optimism. He predicted that the “glorious hour” would soon arrive when all Americans would be defined “by equal birth.”</p>\n\n<h2>Conceived in liberty</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An antique photo of a crowd of soldiers and civilians listening to someone talking in the middle.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705722/original/file-20251201-56-foqft8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A photo by Mathew Brady of Abraham Lincoln – center, bareheaded – giving the Gettysburg Address in 1863.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/photo-by-mathew-brady-of-abraham-lincoln-giving-the-news-photo/514891792?adppopup=true\">Bettman/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In its 1857 <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/dred-scott-v-sandford\">Dred Scott v. Sanford decision</a>, the Supreme Court denied Black Americans the rights of citizenship. </p>\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln denounced the decision and countered by defining a more capacious view of American freedom based on the declaration. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5300/sc5339/000091/000000/000004/restricted/dred_scott/lincoln.htm\">Lincoln told one audience</a> that Thomas Jefferson and the signers of the declaration “set up a standard maxim for free society,” which they “intended to include all men” and to be “constantly looked to, constantly labored for.” </p>\n\n<p>Their goal, Lincoln said, was “augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.”</p>\n\n<p>As civil war ravaged the country and claimed thousands of American lives, Lincoln again drew on the declaration to articulate a vision for the country as president. </p>\n\n<p>In his 1863 Gettysburg Address, commemorating the dead on that Pennsylvania battlefield, Lincoln described the United States as a “<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.24404500/?st=text\">nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>The nation, he said, was undergoing a “new birth of freedom” as it waged war on slavery and defended its government against domestic rebellion.</p>\n\n<h2>Self-evident truth</h2>\n\n<p>Seventy years later, the declaration provided inspiration for President Franklin D. Roosevelt as he steered the nation through a crippling economic depression and the run-up to a world war. Roosevelt advocated for building America’s first social safety net by drawing on the declaration.</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting Roosevelt’s aims, the 1936 Democratic Party platform illustrated this rhetorical strategy, borrowing from the declaration at its very beginning: “<a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/1936-democratic-party-platform\">We hold this truth to be self evident</a> – that government in a modern civilization has certain inescapable obligations to its citizens.” </p>\n\n<p>During his <a href=\"https://www.fdrlibrary.org/address-text\">1944 State of the Union Address</a>, Roosevelt said the nation was built on the rights embedded in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But, he argued, “true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.”</p>\n\n<h2>All created equal</h2>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qyk8sYGghiQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=22\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King Jr. drew on the declaration to define America’s promises to all its citizens.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Amid the political and social upheaval of the 1960s, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. drew directly and self-consciously on the declaration. </p>\n\n<p>In his 1963 “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety\">I Have a Dream” speech</a>, King defined an America that “guaranteed unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” to its citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Though the nation had “defaulted on this promissory note insofar as its citizens of color are concerned,” King said, the declaration still offered him hope: “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal.”</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, Americans saw <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5593112/national-guard-mass-deportations-trump-2026\">the deployment of U.S. troops</a> in major cities, as well as <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/06/11/trumps-deportation-frenzy-echoes-the-fugitive-slave-hunts-of-the-1850s/\">mass immigrant deportations</a>.

      "content": "<p>Picture this: You’re looking to buy a place to live, and you have two options. </p>\n\n<p>Option A is a beautiful home in California near good schools and job opportunities. But it goes for nearly a million dollars – <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/median-home-prices-by-state/\">the median California home sells for US$906,500</a> – and you’d be paying a mortgage that’s <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/793\">risen 82% since January 2020</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Option B is a similar home in Texas, where the median home costs less than half as much: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/median-home-prices-by-state/\">just $353,700</a>. The catch? Option B sits in an area with significant hurricane and flood risk.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.arch.tamu.edu/staff/ivis-garcia/\">professor of urban planning</a>, I know this isn’t just a hypothetical scenario. It’s the impossible choice millions of Americans face every day as the U.S. housing crisis collides with climate change. And we’re not handling it well.</p>\n\n<h2>The numbers tell the story</h2>\n\n<p>The migration patterns are stark. Take California, which <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/population-estimates-international-migration.html\">lost 239,575 residents</a> in 2024 – the largest out-migration of any state. High housing costs are a primary driver: The median home price in California is <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/commentary/2024/10/homeowner-wealth-divide-california-cost/\">more than double the national median</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Where are these displaced residents going? Many are heading to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-texas-moving-arizona-florida-expensive-housing-costs-washington-nevada-2023-10\">southern and western states</a> like Florida and Texas. Texas, which is the top <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-texas-moving-arizona-florida-expensive-housing-costs-washington-nevada-2023-10\">destination for former California residents</a>, saw a net gain of <a href=\"https://www.housingwire.com/articles/migration-2025-where-americans-are-moving-to-and-why/\">85,267 people in 2024</a>, much of it from domestic migration. These newcomers are drawn primarily by more affordable housing markets.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/joFsKIp4Opg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=92\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Housing costs are the main driver of the California exodus, the Los Angeles Times notes.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This isn’t simply people chasing lower taxes. It’s a housing affordability crisis in motion. The annual household income needed to qualify for a mortgage on a mid-tier California home was about $237,000 in June 2025, a recent analysis found – <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/793\">over twice the state’s median household income</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Over 21 million renter households nationwide spent more than 30% of their income on housing costs in 2023, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/renter-households-cost-burdened-race.html\">according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>. For them and others struggling to get by, the financial math is simple, even if the risk calculation isn’t. </p>\n\n<p>I find this troubling. In essence, the U.S. is creating a system where your income determines your exposure to climate disasters. When housing becomes unaffordable in safer areas, the only available and affordable property is often in riskier locations – low-lying areas at flood risk in Houston and coastal Texas, or higher-wildfire-risk areas as California cities expand into fire-prone foothills and canyons.</p>\n\n<h2>Climate risk becomes part of the equation</h2>\n\n<p>The destinations drawing newcomers aren’t exactly safe havens. Research shows that America’s high-fire-risk counties saw <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/climate-migration-real-estate-2024/\">63,365 more people move in than out in 2023</a>, much of that flowing to Texas. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103279\">my own research</a> and other studies of post-disaster recovery have shown how the most vulnerable communities – low-income residents, people of color, renters – face the greatest barriers to rebuilding after disasters strike.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the insurance crisis brewing in these destination states. Dozens of insurers in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and beyond have <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/climate-change-home-insurance\">collapsed in recent years</a>, unable to sustain the mounting claims from increasingly frequent and severe disasters like wildfires and hurricanes. Economists Benjamin Keys and Philip Mulder, who study climate change impacts on real estate, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3386/w32579\">describe the insurance markets in some high-risk areas as “broken”</a>. Between 2018 and 2023, insurers canceled nearly 2 million homeowner policies nationwide – four times the historically typical rate.</p>\n\n<p>Yet people keep moving into risky areas. For example, recent research shows that people have been moving <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fhumd.2022.886545\">toward areas most at risk of wildfires</a>, even holding wealth and other factors constant. The wild beauty of fire-prone areas may be part of the attraction, but so is housing availability and cost.</p>\n\n<h2>The policy failures behind the false choice</h2>\n\n<p>In my view, this isn’t really about individual choice – it’s about policy failure. The state of California aims to build 2.5 million new homes by 2030, which would <a href=\"https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/blog/plan-simplify-housing-california\">require adding more than 350,000 units annually</a>. Yet in 2024, the state only added about 100,000 – <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-housing-production-progress-california/\">falling dramatically short of what’s needed</a>. When local governments restrict housing development through exclusionary zoning, they’re effectively pricing out working families and pushing them toward risk.</p>\n\n<p>My research on disaster recovery has consistently shown how housing policies <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wds.2023.100062\">intersect with climate vulnerability</a>. Communities with limited housing options before disasters become even more constrained afterward. People can’t “choose” resilience if resilient places <a href=\"https://hazards.colorado.edu/public-health-disaster-research/community-based-organizations-in-public-housing-resident-recovery-in-puerto-rico\">won’t let them build affordable housing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government started recognizing this connection – to an extent. For example, in 2023, the Federal Emergency Management Agency encouraged communities to consider <a href=\"https://www.caloes.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Hazard-Mitigation/Documents/FEMA-Local-Mitigation-Planning-Policy-Guide-04.2022.pdf\">“social vulnerability” in disaster planning</a>, in addition to things like geographic risk. Social vulnerability refers to socioeconomic factors like poverty, lack of transportation or language barriers that make it harder for communities to deal with disasters. </p>\n\n<p>However, the agency more recently stepped back from that move – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hurricane-season-is-here-but-femas-policy-change-could-leave-low-income-areas-less-protected-256985\">just as the 2025 hurricane season began</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, when a society forces people to choose between paying for housing and staying safe, that society has failed. Housing should be a right, not a risk calculation. </p>\n\n<p>But until decision-makers address the underlying policies that create housing scarcity in safe areas and fail to protect people in vulnerable ones, climate change will continue to reshape who gets to live where – and who gets left behind when the next disaster strikes.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266136/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Ivis García has received funding from the National Science Foundation; the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; the U.S. Department of Transportation&#39;s National Institute for Transportation and Communities; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; JPB Foundation; Ford Foundation, Pritzker Traubert Foundation; Chicago Community Trust, SBAN, Texas Appleseed, Fundación Comunitaria de Puerto Rico, Urban Institute &amp; UNIDOS, and Natural Hazards Center.</span></em></p>",

And it says the deaths were <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccine-death-and-side-effects-database-relies-on-unverified-reports-and-trump-officials-and-right-wing-media-are-applying-it-out-of-context-265362\">reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS</a>, but provides no evidence that the vaccines caused the deaths. </p>\n\n<p>The death of children due to an unsafe vaccine is a serious allegation. I am a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9AwhlQwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">pediatric cardiologist</a> who has studied the link between COVID-19 vaccines and heart-related side effects <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102809\">such as myocarditis in children</a>. To my knowledge, studies to date have shown such side effects are rare, and severe outcomes even more so. However, I am open to new evidence that could change my mind. </p>\n\n<p>But without sufficient justification and solid evidence, restricting access to an approved vaccine and changing well-established procedures for testing vaccines would carry serious consequences. These moves would limit access for patients, create roadblocks for companies and worsen distrust in vaccines and public health. </p>\n\n<p>In my view, it’s important for people reading about these FDA actions to understand how the evidence on a vaccine’s safety is generally assessed.</p>\n\n<h2>Determining cause of death</h2>\n\n<p>The FDA memo claims that the deaths of these children were <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccines-children-deaths-rcna246437\">directly related to receiving a COVID-19 immunization</a>. </p>\n\n<p>From my perspective as a clinician, it is awful that any child should die from a routine vaccination. </p>\n\n<p>However, health professionals like me owe it to the public to uphold the highest possible standards in investigating why these deaths occurred. If the FDA has evidence demonstrating something that national health agencies worldwide have missed – widespread child deaths due to myocarditis caused by the COVID-19 vaccine – I don’t doubt that even the most pro-vaccine physician will listen. So far, however, no such evidence has been presented. </p>\n\n<p>While a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccine-death-and-side-effects-database-relies-on-unverified-reports-and-trump-officials-and-right-wing-media-are-applying-it-out-of-context-265362\">death logged in VAERS is a starting point</a>, on its own it is insufficient to conclude whether a vaccine caused the death or other medical causes were to blame. </p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate a causal link, FDA staff and physicians must align the VAERS report with physicians’ assessments of the patient, as well as data from other sources for <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-childhood-vaccines-are-carefully-studiedincluding-with-placebosto-ensure-theyre-safe-and-effective/\">monitoring vaccine safety</a>. These include <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.04.088\">PRISM, which logs insurance claims data</a>, and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.048\">Vaccine Safety Datalink, which tracks safety signals</a> in electronic medical records.</p>\n\n<p>It’s known that most deaths logged only in VAERS of children who recently received vaccines <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/what-vaers-is-and-isnt\">have been incorrectly attributed to the vaccines</a> – either by accident or in some cases <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/how-anti-vaxxers-target-grieving-moms-turn-them-crusaders-n1057566\">on purpose by anti-vaccine activists</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Heart-related side effects of COVID-19 vaccines</h2>\n\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://substack.com/@vinayprasadmdmph\">Substack</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1470143561039421442\">Twitter accounts</a>, Prasad has said that he believes the rate of severe cardiac side effects after COVID-19 vaccination is severely underestimated and that the vaccines should be restricted far more than they currently are. </p>\n\n<p>In a July 2025 presentation, Prasad quoted a risk of <a href=\"https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5977619\">27 cases per million of myocarditis</a> in young men who received the COVID-19 vaccine. A 2024 review suggested that number was a bit lower – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12101193\">about 20 cases out of 1 million people</a>. But that same study found that unvaccinated people had greater risk of heart problems after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people. In a different study, people who got myocarditis after a COVID-19 vaccination <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.16380\">developed fewer complications</a> than people who got myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection. </p>\n\n<p>Existing vaccine safety infrastructure in the U.S. successfully identifies dangers posed by vaccines – and did so during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, most COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-rfk-jr-s-misguided-science-on-mrna-vaccines-is-shaping-policy-a-vaccine-expert-examines-the-false-claims-263027\">rely on mRNA technology</a>. But as vaccines were first emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic, two pharmaceutical companies, Janssen and AstraZeneca, rolled out a vaccine that used a different technology, called a viral vector. This type of vaccine had a very rare but genuine safety problem that was detected.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYcDfxjmtxY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A report in VAERS is at most a first step to determining whether a vaccine caused harm.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>VAERS, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, clinical investigators in the U.S. and their European counterparts detected that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779731\">these vaccines did turn out</a> to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34304601/\">cause blood clotting</a>. In April 2021, the FDA <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e4.htm\">formally recommended pausing their use</a>, and they were later pulled from the market. </p>\n\n<p>Death due to myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.049\">exceedingly rare</a>. Demonstrating that it occurred requires proof that the person had myocarditis, evidence that no other reasonable cause of death was present, and the absence of any additional cause of myocarditis. These factors cannot be determined from VAERS data, however – and to date, the FDA has presented no other relevant data. </p>\n\n<h2>A problematic vision for future vaccine approvals</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/fda-official-proposes-impossible-standards-vaccine-testing-could-curtail-access\">vaccines are tested</a> both by seeing how well they prevent disease and by how well they generate <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22971-antibodies\">antibodies</a>, which are the molecules that help your body fight viruses and bacteria. </p>\n\n<p>Some vaccines, such as <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/covid-vaccine\">the COVID-19 vaccine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-do-we-need-new-flu-shots-every-year\">the influenza vaccine</a>, need to be updated based on new strains. The FDA generally approves these updates based on how well the new versions generate antibodies. Since the previous generation of vaccines was already shown to prevent infection, if the new version can generate antibodies like the previous one, researchers assume its ability to prevent infection is comparable too. Later studies can then test how well the vaccines prevent severe disease and hospitalization.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA memo says this approach is insufficient and instead argues for <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/prasad-tells-staffers-fda-planning-tighten-vaccine-recommendations\">replacing such studies</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/29/regulator-fda-stricter-protocols-vaccine-approvals\">many more placebo-controlled trials</a> – not just for COVID-19 vaccines but also for widely used influenza and pneumonia vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>That may seem reasonable theoretically. In practice, however, it is not realistic.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s influenza vaccines must be changed every season to reflect mutations to the virus. If the FDA were to require new placebo-controlled trials every year, the vaccine being tested would become obsolete by the time it is approved. This would be a massive waste of time and resources.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pharmacy with a sign advertising flu shots\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/706214/original/file-20251203-74-rl6vf0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Influenza vaccines must be updated for every flu season.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/healthcare-pharmacy-or-flu-shots-poster-to-promote-royalty-free-image/2158342053\">Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Also, detecting vaccine-related myocarditis at the low rate at which it occurs would have required clinical trials many times larger than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577\">the ones that were done to approve</a> COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. This would have cost at least millions of dollars more, and the delay in rolling out vaccines would have also cost lives. </p>\n\n<p>Placebo-controlled trials would require comparing people who receive the updated vaccine with people who remain unvaccinated. When an older version of the vaccine is already available, this means purposefully <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/14777509211052467\">asking people to forgo that vaccine</a> and risk infection for the sake of the trial, a practice that is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-025-00530-5\">widely considered unethical</a>. Current scientific practice is that only a brand-new vaccine may be compared against placebo.</p>\n\n<p>While suspected vaccine deaths should absolutely be investigated, stopping a vaccine for insufficient reasons can lead to a significant <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv349\">drop in public confidence</a>. That’s why it’s essential to thoroughly and transparently investigate any claims that a vaccine causes harm.</p>\n\n<h2>Vaccine vs illness</h2>\n\n<p>To accurately gauge a vaccine’s risks, it is also crucial to compare its side effects with the effects of the illness it prevents. </p>\n\n<p>For COVID-19, data consistently shows that the disease is clearly more dangerous. From Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, more than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53590\">800 children in the U.S. died due to COVID-19</a>, but very few deaths from COVID-19 vaccines in children have been been verified worldwide. What’s more, the disease <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059970\">causes many more heart-related side effects</a> than the vaccine does. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, extensive evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccination <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.873596\">reduces the risk of hospitalization by more than 70%</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2202826\">the risk of severe illness in adolescent children by 79%</a>. Studies also show it dramatically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211\">reduces their risk of developing long COVID</a>, a condition in which symptoms such as extreme fatigue or weakness persist more than three months after a COVID-19 infection. </p>\n\n<p>Reporting only the vaccines’ risks, and not their benefits, shows just a small part of the picture.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271028/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I am a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and regularly go on social media to share pro vaccine information.</span></em></p>",

I heard it first thanks to my son, whose friend had been singing it on the swings at school. My son found it utterly hilarious, and it’s been playing in our house nonstop ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Like parents all over the world, I rue how my son’s musical tastes have hijacked my listening history. But I’m also tickled to learn that our household is probably one of the few even listening to it.</p>\n\n<p>Spotify Wrapped is an annual campaign by the popular streaming music platform. <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-12-04/10-years-spotify-wrapped/\">Since 2015</a>, the streaming service has been repackaging user data – specifically, the listening history of Spotify’s users over the past year – into attractive, personalized slideshows featuring, among other data points, your top five songs, your total listening time and even your “listening personality.” (Are you a “Replayer,” a “Maverick” or a “Vampire”?)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wvh3JvAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">As a consumer behavior researcher</a>, I’ve thought about why these lists get so much attention each year. I suspect that the success of Spotify Wrapped may have a lot to do with how the flashy, shareable graphics are connected to a couple of fundamental – and somewhat contradictory – human needs.</p>\n\n<h2>Individuality and belonging</h2>\n\n<p>In 1991, social psychologist <a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/person/marilynn-b-brewer\">Marilynn Brewer</a> introduced what she coined “<a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Intergroup_Conflict/Brewer_1991_The_social_self.pdf\">optimal distinctiveness theory</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>She argued that most people are torn between two human needs. On the one hand, there’s the need for “validation and similarity to others.” On the other hand, people want to express their “uniqueness and individuation.” Thus, most of us are constantly striving for a balance between feeling connected to others while also maintaining a sense of our own distinct individuality. </p>\n\n<p>At Thanksgiving, for example, your need for connection is likely more than satisfied. In that moment, you’re surrounded by family and friends who share a lot in common with you. In fact, it can feel so fulfilled that you may start craving the opposite: a way to assert your individuality. Maybe you choose to wear something that really reflects your personality, or you tell stories about interesting experiences you’ve had in the past year. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, you may feel relatively isolated when you move to a new town and feel a stronger need for connection. You may wear the styles and brands you see your neighbors and co-workers wearing, pop into popular cafes and restaurants, or invite people over to your home in an effort to make new friends. </p>\n\n<h2>Have it your way</h2>\n\n<p>When people buy things, they often make choices as a way to satisfy their needs for connection and individuality.</p>\n\n<p>Brands recognize this and usually try to entice consumers with at least one of these two elements. It’s partly why Coca-Cola started releasing bottles featuring popular names on the labels as part of its “<a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/iconic-share-a-coke-is-back-for-a-new-generation\">Share a Coke</a>” campaign. The soft drink remains the same, but grabbing a Coke with your name on it can cultivate a sense of connection with everyone else who has it. And it’s why Apple offers <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/engraving\">custom, personalized engravings</a> for products such as its AirPods and iPads.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Five soft drink bottles, each featuring labels with a different name.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=268&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=268&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=268&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704636/original/file-20251125-56-rp8nvs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Coca-Cola’s ‘Share a Coke’ campaign taps into optimal distinctiveness theory.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ShareaCokeReturnswithMoreNamesMoreFlavorsandMoreWaystoEnjoyIce-ColdSummerRefreshment/9b698ca60a9103d03d4a50e75951b841/photo\">AP Photo/Business Wire</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Spotify Wrapped works because it nails the balance between competing needs: the desire to belong and the desire to stand out.

It’s no wonder, then, that the Wrapped feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/spotify-wrapped-2024-success-failure-engagement-truth-josiah-du-fault-tfh6c/\">has led to impressive engagement</a>: On TikTok, the hashtag #SpotifyWrapped <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-wrapped-a-ux-review-ed8ee19bac2e\">garnered 73.7 billion views in 2023</a>.

We believe the program’s research could be applied to the challenges facing future peace in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons from Colombia</h2>\n\n<p>The Peace Accords Matrix team’s <a href=\"https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/barometer\">work in Colombia</a> is instructive on how an effective monitoring mechanism could be shaped in Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Notre Dame’s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies was tasked with carrying out on-the-ground and real-time monitoring of the <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/a-path-forward-for-colombias-2016-peace-accord-and-lasting-security/\">2016 peace deal</a> between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDZK5UIEW8o?wmode=transparent&amp;start=50\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Peace Accords Matrix’s 30-staffer team in Colombia has served as an independent body monitoring 578 peace accord commitments in areas such as rural reform, political participation and securing justice for victims. These staffers have, for example, traveled to reintegration camps to speak to former combatants in verifying <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/06/560442\">United Nations data</a> on the number of weapons surrendered and destroyed, among other accord targets.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with quantitative and qualitative data, matrix members regularly meet with stakeholders – including victims, former guerrillas and politicians – to <a href=\"https://curate.nd.edu/articles/report/Six_Years_of_Implementation_of_the_Colombian_Final_Accord_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_the_New_Political_Phase/25065881?file=44235263\">assess the status of implementation and to identify areas</a> that need to be prioritized.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, the work has highlighted when and where there has been insufficient progress in boosting livelihoods and leadership <a href=\"https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Towards-Implementation-of-Womens-Rights-in-the-Colombian-Final-Peace-Accord-2.pdf\">opportunities for women</a> and <a href=\"https://curate.nd.edu/articles/report/A_Call_to_Action_to_Accelerate_the_Colombian_Accord_s_Ethnic_Commitments/26931982/1?file=49234405\">ethnic minorities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This reporting has prompted new attention toward implementing these obligations laid out in the accord.</p>\n\n<h2>What does Ukraine need?</h2>\n\n<p>Our experience shows that when it comes to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine, it is imperative that a mandate for robust monitoring is spelled out clearly and realistically. To be effective, a monitoring body must have the independence to <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-Y3_P31-PURL-gpo147795/pdf/GOVPUB-Y3_P31-PURL-gpo147795.pdf\">fully report and document violations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s just the first step. Consider the <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/ukraine-russia-and-the-minsk-agreements-a-post-mortem/\">failure of the Minsk agreements</a>, signed in 2014 and 2015 to end fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists.</p>\n\n<p>Those accords failed in part because the monitoring mission, led by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, lacked any defined mechanism to press for any action or change once violations – and there were many – <a href=\"https://gppi.net/assets/Presence-without-Power_Lessons-from-the-OSCE-SMM.pdf\">had been established</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the organization’s Special Monitoring Mission <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/shrs/31/1-4/article-p121_121.xml\">may have contributed</a> to some temporary de-escalation in the Donbas conflict, ultimately Russia was able to exploit the <a href=\"https://epicenter.wcfia.harvard.edu/blog/through-ashes-minsk-agreements\">weaknesses of the Minsk agreements</a> and commit hostile acts, laying the groundwork for the current war.</p>\n\n<p>Research suggests that monitoring works best when it extends beyond physical ceasefire lines to encompass the cyber domain, too. Moscow has carried out <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/learning-the-lessons-from-ukraines-fight-against-russian-cyber-warfare/\">extensive cyberattacks</a> on Ukrainian infrastructure throughout the conflict. Such aggression could continue invisibly despite a ceasefire, allowing one party to pre-position capabilities for future attacks or to conduct espionage without triggering traditional monitoring mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike conventional military activities, such cyber hostilities are inherently difficult to monitor and verify. A comprehensive monitoring arrangement will need to grapple with these threats, requiring carefully designed information-sharing protocols with the few international actors capable of <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/securing-digital-and-orbital-frontiers-ukraine\">monitoring the online activities of both sides</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A bigger tent</h2>\n\n<p>A key element of ensuring a durable peace is building trust between conflict parties over time. With the right mandate and authority, monitoring bodies can create space and structure for follow-on dialogue as implementation obstacles emerge. Durable <a href=\"https://curate.nd.edu/articles/report/A_Panoramic_View_of_Factors_for_Successful_Peace_Accord_Implementation/24742146/1/files/43645278.pdf\">peace processes require</a> fine-tuning to adapt to changing political realities on the ground.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A soldier walks down a road surrounded by bombed-out buildings\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=336&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705940/original/file-20251202-56-c1aend.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The war in Ukraine has dragged on for nearly four years.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/screen-grab-from-a-video-shows-the-city-as-the-kremlin-news-photo/2248935100?adppopup=true\">Russian Defense Ministry/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Involving public stakeholders in the implementation of a peace agreement is another key element, <a href=\"https://curate.nd.edu/articles/report/A_Panoramic_View_of_Factors_for_Successful_Peace_Accord_Implementation/24742146/1/files/43645278.pdf\">our research shows</a>. Third-party monitoring can provide the framework for soliciting outside perspectives and participation. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations have steadily developed expertise in monitoring and accountability in areas including elections, procurement, humanitarian operations and <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-ngos-help-prosecutors-document-russian-war-crimes/a-65095322#:%7E:text=Over%2030%20Ukrainian%20NGOs%20are%20supporting%20investigations,since%20Russia%20illegally%20annexed%20Crimea%20in%202014.\">potential war crime activity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Building on this experience by involving broader segments of civil society – including the country’s highly trusted <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/programs/religion-and-conflict-country-profiles/ukraine\">faith-based communities</a> – would strengthen the legitimacy of third-party monitoring in the eyes of the domestic public and assuage uneasy acceptance of any peace accord.</p>\n\n<h2>Ready on Day 1</h2>\n\n<p>While the United Nations and other multinational bodies are well placed to support some core monitoring tasks, those planning for peace now should, we believe, consider the benefits of involving a wider range of third-party actors. Indeed, many Ukrainians are skeptical that <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/06/un-security-council-reform-what-the-world-thinks?lang=en\">institutions of which Russia is a member</a> can carry out their work with the needed independence. </p>\n\n<p>As we have seen with the Peace Accords Matrix’s experience, the involvement of an independent research institution can open up new possibilities for monitoring. </p>\n\n<p>And ideally, monitoring missions should be ready to go from Day 1, or as close to that as possible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-Y3_P31-PURL-gpo147795/pdf/GOVPUB-Y3_P31-PURL-gpo147795.pdf\">Comparative research</a> has shown that the speed at which a monitoring mission starts its work can affect its relevance. Yet, many monitoring bodies are wracked by delays due to lack of planning, support and resources. </p>\n\n<p>The current 28-point peace plan being mulled by Russia and Ukraine makes only a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/20/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-28-points-russia\">brief mention of monitoring</a>, by a “Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump.”</p>\n\n<p>But our experience shows that prioritizing third-party monitoring and delving into the details of how it would be carried out – even as ceasefire negotiations are ongoing – can help ensure the <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3987-1.html\">success of a future deal</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It would serve as a vital signal to Ukrainians that, unlike the aftermath of the Minsk agreements, this time the <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/ukraine/bigger-table-case-more-global-diplomacy-over-ukraine\">international community</a> will continue to engage and act to ensure their country’s peace.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268469/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Imagine going from having a book club with your co-workers to seeing them only on a Signal chat where every member has to be vetted – and the main conversation topic is when you might lose your job.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what it was like for workers at one federal agency earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>“I’d never seen anything like the sort of organization that happened during the RIFs (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12908\">layoffs, or reductions in force</a>) in supporting each other with news, information and job resources,” said Anthony, a federal worker who’d been with the agency for almost a decade before his position was eliminated. He asked that his real name and other identifying details not be published, out of fear of retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony’s not alone. So far in 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/tracking-federal-workforce-firings-dg\">tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs</a>. And during the shutdown, approximately <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-furloughs.html\">600,000 were threatened with layoffs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But something else happened alongside the cuts: Federal workers began building support networks online – connecting with colleagues inside their agencies and with strangers outside them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://anth.la.psu.edu/people/anne-pisor/\">I’m an anthropologist</a>, which means I study human nature and human diversity, and I’m an expert in how people cooperate to manage risk. Watching federal workers use social media to provide mutual support offered a rare real-time view of the process. To deepen my understanding, I interviewed several federal workers who work in different parts of government.</p>\n\n<p>They told me that in the past, federal workers haven’t always interacted with their co-workers outside of work, much less connected across federal agencies. But thanks to online platforms, that’s changing.</p>\n\n<p>As they’ve faced RIFs, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/oral-history-doge-federal-workers/\">operational changes from the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-house-vote-deal-end-longest-government-shutdown-history-2025-11-12/\">the longest government shutdown in history</a>, current and former federal workers have come together in online spaces to support one another. The result is a vivid example of how people create resilient networks, often spanning group boundaries and distance, in response to uncertainty and threats. </p>\n\n<h2>Reaching out across groups and across distance</h2>\n\n<p>In 2025, federal workers built social networks like the ones we study in my lab. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/evan.21793\">When experiencing widespread shocks</a> – things such as droughts or mass job loss – humans past and present have relied on relationships that stretch beyond the individuals affected. Often that means getting support from people at a distance, and it can also mean <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-022-09431-1\">reaching out across groups</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When just a few people reach across groups, social scientists call these connectors “brokers.” They often <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392\">move information across groups</a>. As a user of LinkedIn and Bluesky, I have observed that federal workers in positions of power, or who have been recently RIFed and thus have less to lose, are often brokers, because <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/nih-trump-jenna-norton.html\">with visibility comes risk of retribution</a>. These brokers share information on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/furloughed-federal-workers-unemployment-claims\">where to find unemployment benefits</a> or how to sign petitions calling for scientific independence.</p>\n\n<p>There are even more connections spanning distance and agencies when workers can remain anonymous. Platforms such as Reddit and Bluesky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/altgov-elon-musk-doge-federal-workers\">are places where workers feel safer to speak freely</a>. There, workers can share information and also frustration, little wins, and some laughs.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, as my lab has shown, these long-distance relationships can also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2022.0269\">bolster collective action</a> – working toward a shared goal, often across space and across groups, such as federal agencies.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Julia Simon – who agreed to let me use her name but asked that other identifying details be withheld – has a friend who works at the same federal agency as her but lives in a different part of the country. This year, her friend suggested that Julia join the <a href=\"https://www.federalunionists.net\">Federal Unionists Network</a>. Members from across agencies provide mutual support and work together toward change in their union – the <a href=\"https://www.afge.org\">American Federation of Government Employees</a> – and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve felt that within my own local and district I’ve been seen as too radical so my ideas tend to get shot down or ignored,” Simon told me in an interview. “But finding a group of other AFGE activists who have similar views and goals has been validating.”</p>\n\n<h2>Hunkering down among trusted others</h2>\n\n<p>That said, when people fear surveillance and possible retaliation, they may not reach out to long-distance connections. Instead, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-13381-8_9\">networks often shift toward tight-knit clusters</a>, reducing risk of exposure and increasing trust.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/25/signal-government-trump-administration-federal-workers/\">many federal workers leaned into private Signal chats</a> with their co-workers. Users are vetted before they can join Signal chats to help workers feel safer in these spaces.</p>\n\n<p>When workers were faced with RIFs, a visit from DOGE or the government shutdown, Signal chat activity would increase, workers told me.</p>\n\n<p>“The content was largely ‘I heard from our division director that the RIF notices will go out Friday’ or ‘If you’re comfortable with it, here’s a Zoom workshop on how to manage your emotions during layoffs,’” Anthony said. At their peak, he told me, these chats had hundreds of participants.</p>\n\n<p>Mason, furloughed from a different agency during the shutdown, gave another example. “Today, there are about a dozen messages among federal employees who are trying to provide information and support to each other about applying for unemployment benefits,” he said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p>Though these Signal groups are tight-knit, long-distance relationships still are a source of information – bringing news from spouses and friends at other agencies and content from Reddit, LinkedIn and Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p>For some workers, the most important benefit of these Signal chats is the sense of community they provide.</p>\n\n<p>“These group chats and communities sprung up because we were being terrorized and we only had each other for support,” Anthony said. “I remember seeing some wild statistic early on that said a lot of folks support DOGE’s mission – from our side, it was like, ‘Guess we’re on our own.’ I can’t tell you how many times I heard, ‘Nobody is coming to save us’ – so that’s why we needed these groups.”</p>\n\n<h2>Learning from federal workers’ experiences</h2>\n\n<p>These stories from federal workers are a reminder of how hundreds of thousands of Americans working for the public may be experiencing <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2025/06/federal-workers-manage-uncertainty\">uncertainty, fear, loss and isolation this year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>They also offer important lessons on how to build the resilient networks that sustain us as people.</p>\n\n<p>First, if you feel you cannot trust others, trust can emerge in highly connected clusters that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-13381-8_9\">pool information and take action</a>. As Anthony highlighted, forming these clusters can provide individuals with a sense of community.</p>\n\n<p>Second, connections spanning groups and distance open doors for transmitting information and, as Julia experienced, for <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2022.0269\">engaging in collective action</a>. Long-distance relationships can also help you access things that can be hard to find, such as information about what’s next, support with food or loans, and even new job opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>These resilient networks are a reminder that online platforms have a silver lining. Many news stories focus on how social media use can negatively affect people’s mental health or social relationships. What federal workers highlight, however, is that the effect of online platforms on your well-being <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.10.005\">can depend on how you use them</a>. </p>\n\n<p>LinkedIn, Reddit, Signal and other platforms can allow you to create and sustain networks that might be impossible to have in person, either because trust is low or simply because you’re busy. Online platforms allow people to build tight-knit clusters or to have more long-distance relationships at greater distances than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>So whether you’re looking for like-minded others, people who can help you face something you’ve never faced before, or a sense of community when you’ve lost so much, online platforms remain an important tool to help us find each other.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270272/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Anne Pisor receives funding from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Penn State Social Science Research Institute.

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/resources/databases/advanced-reactors-information-system-aris\">about 70 different designs</a> being researched and developed around the world, including reactors that could one day serve small or remote communities, military applications and even ships at sea or spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents say these reactor designs provide <a href=\"https://www.arup.com/en-us/insights/small-modular-reactors-and-their-potential/\">consistent power without climate-changing carbon emissions</a>. They can also be located close to places that need their energy, reducing dependence on the electricity grid. They are still years from being commercially available: Demonstration projects may begin construction before 2030, with commercial ones <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/the-path-to-a-new-era-for-nuclear-energy/executive-summary\">reaching operation perhaps by the mid-2030s</a>.

Conventional plants are built in permanent locations on large plots of land around reactor cores as tall as 30 feet (10 meters). They usually generate <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65104\">more than 1,000 megawatts of power</a>, enough to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/electricity-use-in-homes.php\">supply 700,000 to 1 million homes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The other types are still being researched and are considerably smaller. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nuclear-in-your-backyard-tiny-reactors-could-one-day-power-towns-and-campuses-but-community-input-will-be-key-261225\">Microreactors</a> have cores that are small enough to fit into the trailer of a semitruck. They can be installed on land about as big as a football field and generate less than 20 megawatts.</p>\n\n<p>Small modular reactors are in between. Their cores are roughly 9 feet (3 meters) across and 18 feet (6 meters) tall. The entire operation occupies an area of <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2022/12/15/dominion-energy-plans-to-deploy-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-statewide-by-2032/\">about 50 acres</a> and can <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/in-charts-will-small-modular-reactors-drive-nuclear-growth-in-2024-4403e824/\">generate up to 300 megawatts</a> of electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the reactors’ size, they can be built in factories from various components and then be shipped by truck, rail or water to the location where they are assembled.</p>\n\n<p>All the different types of small modular reactors generate heat the same way: by splitting heavy atoms and capturing the heat into a variety of materials – like <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/power/pwrs\">water</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/liquid-metal-cooled-reactor\">liquid metal</a> or <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-molten-salt-reactors\">molten salt</a> – that circulate through water to generate steam that drives a turbine.</p>\n\n<p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_71126/examining-the-safety-of-small-modular-reactors\">designed with safety features</a> to reduce the risk and severity of accidents that might release radiation or radioactive material into the surroundings. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/products/nuscale-power-module\">passive systems</a> and those based on fundamental principles like gravity can terminate nuclear reactions before they reach levels where explosions or leaks might occur. These reactors also produce less heat and have far smaller amounts of nuclear material than traditional large reactors, which can reduce the radioactivity risk as well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large green item is on a pier next to a ship and a crane.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703228/original/file-20251118-56-c664sz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The green-wrapped core module of a small nuclear reactor is readied for transfer to a ship.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-core-module-of-the-acp100-multi-purpose-small-modular-news-photo/1549715408\">Liu Xuan/VCG via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Construction and deployment</h2>\n\n<p>Small modular reactors are well-suited to provide electricity in remote places or regions without a large power grid – places where large nuclear power plants are impractical.</p>\n\n<p>Their compact design and flexible placements make them ideal for small geographical regions or industrial installations, like desalination plants, or in countries just starting to develop nuclear power.</p>\n\n<p>They can be built and put into operation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2022.111922\">within two or three years</a> – more quickly than the decade or longer it can take to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231201044031/https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/generic-schedules\">secure permits and construction of standard nuclear power plants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/nuclear-construction-time\">complete construction</a> of a large nuclear plant.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a range of technical challenges before small modular reactors can actually be built and put into use. These include relatively straightforward questions like how many people are needed to operate each reactor, and more complex <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced\">decisions about refinements to safety regulations</a>, both <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/international-cooperation/nrc-cnsc-moc\">in the U.S. and internationally</a>. It’s also not yet clear what the best way is to <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/publications/15790/small-modular-reactors-advances-in-smr-developments-2024\">manage the transport of radioactive materials</a>, especially for reactors that use coolants other than water, which could produce new forms of radioactive waste.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding the fuel</h2>\n\n<p>Larger nuclear power plants use fuel that is <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/topics/leubank/what-is-leu\">about 5% uranium-235</a>, the element that splits in a nuclear reaction, releasing heat. But many small modular reactor designs use a  different fuel, with <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-high-assay-low-enriched-uranium-haleu\">between 5% and 20% uranium-235</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This different fuel, called “high-assay low-enriched uranium,” lets the reactors generate more electricity from a smaller volume of fuel material. And though it contains significantly more uranium than standard nuclear fuel, it remains far below the concentration of <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/uranium-enrichment-for-peace-or-for-weapons/\">90% uranium-235 that is used in nuclear weapons</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The more concentrated fuel also allows reactors to run longer between refueling and reduces the amount of radioactive waste that remains after the fuel is spent.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person stands in front of a complicated piece of machinery.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703230/original/file-20251118-56-d5xn9w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An engineer at a French research center works on equipment as part of efforts to develop a small modular reactor.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/engineers-work-in-the-everest-installation-of-the-poseidon-news-photo/1800258861\">Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>US efforts</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Energy is working to develop <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/haleu-availability-program\">domestic manufacturing of this type of uranium for small modular reactors</a>, to avoid being dependent on foreign sources.</p>\n\n<p>Under a government contract, a Maryland-headquartered nuclear fuel company called Centrus Energy has <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/centrus-reaches-900-kilogram-mark-haleu-production\">produced nearly 1 ton (920 kilograms)</a> of that fuel since 2023 under a contract <a href=\"https://www.centrusenergy.com/news/centrus-energy-finalizes-contract-with-u-s-department-of-energy-to-complete-haleu-cascade-construction-and-produce-haleu-for-up-to-10-years/\">estimated to cost taxpayers US$120 million</a>. In mid-2025, Centrus received a <a href=\"https://investors.centrusenergy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/centrus-energy-secures-contract-extension-department-energy\">$110 million contract extension</a> to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/centrus-reaches-900-kilogram-mark-haleu-production\">produce that amount again</a> by the middle of 2026.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy is distributing the fuel Centrus has made to five companies for <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-distribute-first-amounts-haleu-us-advanced-reactor-developers\">demonstrations and development projects</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing waste</h2>\n\n<p>All nuclear plants require safe handling of the fuel and the resulting waste. There is no permanent place to store nuclear waste in the U.S. Most nuclear waste is stored <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-and-where-is-nuclear-waste-stored-in-the-us-252475\">on the land around the reactors</a> where it was generated.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy says it is trying to find a place to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/em/doe-managed-spent-nuclear-fuel\">temporarily store waste from small modular reactors</a>, but that process has been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-and-where-is-nuclear-waste-stored-in-the-us-252475\">tied up in the courts for years</a> and may not be resolved anytime soon. </p>\n\n<h2>Other industrial uses</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to delivering electricity, small modular reactors can also <a href=\"https://www.arup.com/en-us/insights/small-modular-reactors-and-their-potential/\">directly generate large amounts of heat</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That can be <a href=\"https://www.arup.com/en-us/insights/small-modular-reactors-and-their-potential/\">useful for desalination plants</a>, which use both electricity and heat to convert seawater into fresh water for drinking and irrigation. Remote mining operations also often need both heat and power to operate equipment, ensure living quarters are habitable and <a href=\"https://imegcorp.com/insights/blog/how-small-modular-reactors-could-transform-industrial-energy-use-podcast-included/\">process minerals</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Small modular reactors may also be useful on university campuses. A <a href=\"https://npre.illinois.edu/about/illinois-microreactor-project\">microreactor planned for the University of Illinois</a> will provide power and steam to campus buildings, while also teaching students how to operate nuclear plants, and offer research and demonstration opportunities for more reactor improvements in the future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268628/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Leonel Lagos does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The divisions were rooted in religion. </p>\n\n<p>The Protestant minority denounced Catholics as “superstitious idolaters,” while the Catholics condemned Protestants as “<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Hatred-in-Print-Catholic-Propaganda-and-Protestant-Identity-During-the-French-Wars-of-Religion/Racaut/p/book/9780754602842\">seditious heretics</a>.” In 1560, Protestant conspirators attempted to <a href=\"https://www.amphilsoc.org/publications/season-conspiracy-calvin-french-reformed-churches-and-protestant-plotting-reign\">kidnap the young King Francis II</a>, hoping to replace his zealous Catholic regents with ones more sympathetic to the Protestant cause. </p>\n\n<p>Two years later, the country collapsed into civil war. The French Wars of Religion had begun – and would convulse the country for the next 36 years.</p>\n\n<p>I am <a href=\"https://sites.mst.edu/bruening/\">a historian of the Reformation</a> who writes about the <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/refusing-to-kiss-the-slipper-9780197566954?q=bruening&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us\">opponents of John Calvin</a>, a leading Protestant theologian who influenced Reformed Christians, Presbyterians, Puritans and other denominations for centuries. One of the most significant of Calvin’s rivals was the humanist <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315243597/sebastian-castellio-1515-1563-bruce-gordon-hans-guggisberg\">Sebastian Castellio</a>, whom he had worked with in Geneva before a bitter falling out over theology.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after the first war in France broke out, Castellio penned <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1012796780\">a treatise that was far ahead of its time</a>. Rather than join in the bitter denunciations raging between Protestants and Catholics, Castellio condemned intolerance itself.</p>\n\n<p>He identified the main problem as both sides’ efforts to “force consciences” – to compel people to believe things they did not believe. In my view, that advice from nearly five centuries ago has much to say to the world today. </p>\n\n<h2>Foreseeing the carnage</h2>\n\n<p>Castellio rose to prominence in 1554 when he condemned the execution of Michael Servetus, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Servetus\">a medical doctor and theologian</a> convicted of heresy. Servetus had rejected the standard Christian belief in the Trinity, which holds that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three persons in one God.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A dark-colored statue of a downcast, seated man, positioned in front of trees and bushes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704060/original/file-20251123-56-w1vyx0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A monument to Michael Servetus, who was condemned for heresy and executed, in Geneva.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monument_to_Michael_Servetus,_Geneva.jpg\">Iantomferry/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Already condemned by the Catholic Inquisition in France, Servetus was passing through Geneva when Calvin urged his arrest and advocated for his execution.

To the Catholics, referring to decades of Protestant persecution in France, he said: “Recall how you have treated the evangelicals. You have pursued and imprisoned them … and then you have roasted them alive at a slow fire to prolong their torture. And for what crime? Because they did not believe in the pope, the Mass, and purgatory. … Is that a good and just cause for burning men alive?”</p>\n\n<p>To the Protestants, he complained, “You are forcing them against their consciences to attend your sermons, and what is worse, you are forcing some to take up arms against their own brothers.” He noted that they were using three “remedies” for healing the church, “namely bloodshed, the forcing of consciences, and the condemning and regarding as unfaithful of those who are not entirely in agreement with your doctrine.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A sepia-colored illustration of a man with a long goatee, wearing a black jacket with buttons.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1100&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1100&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704064/original/file-20251123-62-t5vjm3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1100&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A portrait of Sebastian Castellio, made by 18th-century printmaker Heinrich Pfenninger.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/portrait-of-sebastian-castellio-print-maker-heinrich-news-photo/1486947410?adppopup=true\">Sepia Times/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In short, Castellio accused both sides of ignoring the Golden Rule: “Do not do unto others what you would not want them to do unto you,” he wrote. “This is a rule so true, so just, so natural, and so written by the finger of God in the hearts of all,” he asserted, that none can deny it.</p>\n\n<p>Both sides were trying to promote their vision of true religion, Castellio said, but both were going about it the wrong way. In particular, he warned against trying to justify evil behavior by appealing to its possible effects: “One should not do wrong in order that good may result from it.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/autour-de-michel-servet-et-de-sebastien-castellion-recueil/oclc/819531\">In another essay</a>, he made the same point to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20673701\">argue against torture</a>, writing that “Evil must not be done in order to pursue the good.” Castellio was the anti-Machiavelli; for him, the ends did not justify the means.</p>\n\n<h2>Force doesn’t work</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, “Advice to a Desolate France” argued that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Dvo7AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=conseil%20%C3%A0%20la%20france%20d%C3%A9sol%C3%A9e&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">forcing people to your own way of thinking never works</a>: “We manifestly see that those who are forced to accept the Christian religion, whether they are a people or individuals, never make good Christians.”</p>\n\n<p>Americans, I believe, would do well to bear Castellio’s words in mind today. The country’s two dominant political parties <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/655190/political-parties-historically-polarized-ideologically.aspx\">have become increasingly polarized</a>. Students are <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2024/04/25/students-increasingly-uncomfortable-sharing-political-opinions\">reluctant to speak out</a> on controversial topics for fear of “saying the wrong thing.” Americans increasingly think in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/derrida-trump-ted-lasso-binaries.html\">binary terms</a> of good and evil, friends and enemies.</p>\n\n<p>In the 16th century, Christians failed to heed Castellio’s advice and continued to kill each other over differences of belief for another hundred years. It would be wise to apply his ideas to today’s bitter divisions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266457/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michael Bruening does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/18/ice-spends-millions-on-social-media-spy-tech-banned-by-meta-facebook/\">is one of the customers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. government doesn’t need to collect data about people’s locations itself, because your mobile phone is already doing it. While location data is sometimes collected as part of a mobile phone app’s intended use, like for navigation or to get a weather forecast, more often locations are collected invisibly in the background.</p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uXpvv2V2xKkC&amp;hl=en\">privacy researcher</a> who studies how people understand and make decisions about data that is collected about them, and I research new ways to help consumers get back some control over their privacy. Unfortunately, once you give an app or webpage permission to collect location data, you no longer have control over how the data is used and shared, including who the data is shared with or sold to. </p>\n\n<h2>Why mobile phones collect location data</h2>\n\n<p>Mobile phones collect location data for two reasons: as a by-product of their normal operation, and because they are required to by law. </p>\n\n<p>Mobile phones are constantly scanning for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5DtwjQnNgiw?si=WICOXGd6um9CkXnd\">nearby cell towers</a> so that when someone wants to place a call or send a text, their phone is already connected to the closest tower. This makes it faster to place a call or send a text.</p>\n\n<p>To maintain quality of service, mobile phones often connect with multiple cell towers at the same time. The range of the radio signal from a cell tower can be thought of as a big bubble with the cell tower in the center. The location of a mobile phone can be <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/module/mobile-phones-location-tracking\">calculated via triangulation</a> based on the intersection of the bubbles surrounding each of the cell towers the phone is connected to.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to cell tower triangulation, since 2001 mobile phone carriers have been <a href=\"https://www.911.gov/assets/History-of-911-And-What-It-Means-for-the-Future-of-Emergency-Communications.pdf\">required by law</a> to provide latitude and longitude information for phones that have been used to call 911. This supports faster response times from emergency responders. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0kvYuAnJNQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The ‘Today’ show gives an overview of how your phone reveals where you go and what you do.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How location data ends up being shared</h2>\n\n<p>When people allow webpages and apps to access location data generated by their mobile phones, the software maker can share that data widely without asking for further permission. Sometimes the apps themselves do this directly through partnerships between the maker and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers\">data brokers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>More often, apps and webpages that contain advertisements share location data via a process called “<a href=\"https://epic.org/what-is-real-time-bidding/\">real-time bidding</a>,” which determines which ads are shown. This process involves third parties hired by advertisers, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-bad-ads-appear-on-good-websites-a-computer-scientist-explains-178268\">place automated bids</a> on the ad space to ensure that ads are shown to people who match the profile of interests the advertisers are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>To identify the target audience for the ads, software embedded in the app or webpage shares information collected about the user, including their location, with the third parties placing the bids. These third parties are middlemen that can keep the data and do whatever they want with it, including selling the data to location data brokers, whether or not their bid wins the auction for the ad space.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens to the data once it is shared</h2>\n\n<p>The data acquired by location data brokers is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/data-brokers-know-everything-about-you-what-ftc-case-against-ad-tech-giant-kochava-reveals-218232\">sold widely</a>, including to companies called <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/computer-science/location-based-services-lbs\">location-based service providers</a> that repackage it and sell access to tools that monitor people’s locations. Some of these tools do things like provide roadside assistance. Others are used by <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/how-ad-tech-became-cop-spy-tech\">police</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-agencies-buy-vast-quantities-of-personal-information-on-the-open-market-a-legal-scholar-explains-why-and-what-it-means-for-privacy-in-the-age-of-ai-207707\">government agencies</a> and others to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile/\">track down individuals</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2025, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/18/ice-spends-millions-on-social-media-spy-tech-banned-by-meta-facebook/\">news outlets reported</a> that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had purchased a location surveillance tool from a company called Penlink that can <a href=\"https://www.acludc.org/app/uploads/2025/08/8.5.2025-FOIA-Request-Cobwebs.pdf\">track movements of specific mobile devices</a> over time in a given location. Tools like this allow users to access location data from “<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-buys-sinister-tool-built-to-map-your-everyday-movements/\">hundreds of millions of mobile phones</a>” without a warrant.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>The invisible collection, sale and repackaging of location data is a problem because location data is extremely sensitive and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep01376\">cannot be made anonymous</a>. The two most common locations a person visits are their home and where they work. From this information alone, it is trivially easy to determine a person’s identity and match it with the other location data about them that these companies have acquired. </p>\n\n<p>Also, most people don’t realize that the location data they allowed apps and services to collect for one purpose, like navigation or weather, can reveal sensitive personal information about them that they may not want to be sold to a location data broker. For example, a research study I published about fitness tracker data found that even though people use location data to track their route while exercising, they <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2017/technical-sessions/presentation/rader\">didn’t think about</a> how that data could be used to infer their home address. </p>\n\n<p>This lack of awareness means that people can’t be expected to anticipate that data collected through the normal use of their mobile phones might be available to, for example, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>More restrictions on how mobile phone carriers and apps are allowed to collect and share location data – and on how the government is allowed to obtain and use location information about people – could help protect your privacy. To date, Federal Trade Commission efforts to curb carriers’ data sales have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/court-rejects-verizon-claim-that-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal/\">had mixed results</a> in federal court, and only a few states are <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/privacy-map-how-states-are-fighting-location-surveillance\">attempting to pass legislation</a> to tackle the problem.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267808/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Emilee Rader receives funding from the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

The surge has strained data infrastructure, which requires lots of electricity to operate. A single, medium-sized data center here on Earth can consume enough electricity to power about 16,500 homes, with even larger facilities <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/data-centers-powering-ai-could-use-more-electricity-than-entire-cities.html\">using as much as a small city</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, tech leaders have increasingly advocated for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/now-tech-moguls-want-to-build-data-centers-in-outer-space-a8d08b4b\">space-based AI infrastructure</a> as a way to address the power requirements of data centers.</p>\n\n<p>In space, sunshine – which solar panels can convert into electricity – is abundant and reliable. On Nov. 4, 2025, <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/\">Google unveiled Project Suncatcher</a>, a bold proposal to launch an 81-satellite constellation into low Earth orbit. It plans to use the constellation to harvest sunlight to power the next generation of AI data centers in space. So, instead of beaming power back to Earth, the constellation would beam data back to Earth. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you asked a chatbot how to bake sourdough bread, instead of firing up a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/data-center-locations-us-map-ai-boom-2025-9\">data center in Virginia</a> to craft a response, your query would be beamed up to the constellation in space, processed by chips running purely on solar energy, and the recipe sent back down to your device. Doing so would mean leaving the <a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/ai-models-are-devouring-energy-tools-reduce-consumption-are-here-if-data-centers-will-adopt\">substantial heat generated</a> behind in the cold vacuum of space.</p>\n\n<p>As a technology entrepreneur, I applaud Google’s ambitious plan. But <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oeyIipsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">as a space scientist</a>, I predict that the company will soon have to reckon with a growing problem: space debris.</p>\n\n<h2>The mathematics of disaster</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/space-junk-in-earth-orbit-and-on-the-moon-will-increase-with-future-missions-but-nobodys-in-charge-of-cleaning-it-up-212421\">Space debris</a> – the collection of defunct human-made objects in Earth’s orbit – is already affecting space agencies, companies and astronauts. This debris includes large pieces, such as spent rocket stages and dead satellites, as well as tiny flecks of paint and other fragments from discontinued satellites. </p>\n\n<p>Space debris travels at hypersonic speeds of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/headquarters/library/find/bibliographies/space-debris/\">approximately 17,500 miles per hour</a> (28,000 km/h) in low Earth orbit. At this speed, colliding with a piece of debris the size of a blueberry would feel like being hit by a falling anvil. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"F7vsM\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F7vsM/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Satellite breakups and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/russian-anti-satellite-weapon-test-what-happened-and-what-are-the-risks-172016\">anti-satellite tests</a> have created an alarming amount of debris, a crisis now exacerbated by the rapid expansion of commercial constellations such as SpaceX’s Starlink. The Starlink network has <a href=\"https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html\">more than 7,500 satellites</a>, which provide global high-speed internet.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Space Force actively tracks over 40,000 objects larger than a softball using <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/article/space-debris-101\">ground-based radar and optical telescopes</a>. However, this number <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/there-is-too-much-trash-in-space/\">represents less than 1%</a> of the lethal objects in orbit. The majority are too small for these telescopes to reliably identify and track. </p>\n\n<p>In November 2025, three Chinese astronauts aboard the Tiangong space station were <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stranded-chinese-astronauts-return-to-earth-but-space-junk-threats-remain/\">forced to delay their return to Earth</a> because their capsule had been struck by a piece of space debris. Back in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/science/spacewalk-russia-soyuz.html\">a similar incident</a> on the International Space Station challenged relations between the United States and Russia, as Russian media speculated that a NASA astronaut may have deliberately sabotaged the station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The orbital shell Google’s project targets – a Sun-synchronous orbit approximately 400 miles (650 kilometers) above Earth – is a prime location for uninterrupted solar energy. At this orbit, the spacecraft’s solar arrays will always be in direct sunshine, where they can generate electricity to power the onboard AI payload. But for this reason, Sun-synchronous orbit is also the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/satellites/is-low-earth-orbit-getting-too-crowded-new-study-rings-an-alarm-bell\">single most congested highway in low Earth orbit</a>, and objects in this orbit are the most likely to collide with other satellites or debris.</p>\n\n<p>As new objects arrive and existing objects break apart, low Earth orbit could approach <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-OwOc1AFQ\">Kessler syndrome</a>. In this theory, once the number of objects in low Earth orbit exceeds a critical threshold, collisions between objects generate a cascade of new debris. Eventually, this cascade of collisions could render certain orbits entirely unusable.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications for Project Suncatcher</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-suncatcher/\">Project Suncatcher proposes</a> a cluster of satellites carrying large solar panels. They would fly with a radius of just one kilometer, each node spaced less than 200 meters apart. To put that in perspective, imagine a racetrack roughly the size of the Daytona International Speedway, where 81 cars race at 17,500 miles per hour – while separated by gaps about the distance you need to safely brake on the highway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ultradense formation is necessary for the satellites to transmit data to each other. The constellation splits complex AI workloads across all its 81 units, enabling them to “think” and process data simultaneously as a single, massive, distributed brain. Google <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/anishasircar/2025/11/11/google-unveils-project-suncatcher-to-run-ai-on-solar-satellites-in-orbit/\">is partnering with a space company</a> to launch two prototype satellites by early 2027 to validate the hardware.</p>\n\n<p>But in the vacuum of space, flying in formation is a constant battle against physics. While the atmosphere in low Earth orbit is incredibly thin, it is not empty. Sparse air particles create <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/impacts/satellite-drag\">orbital drag on satellites</a> – this force pushes against the spacecraft, slowing it down and forcing it to drop in altitude. Satellites with large surface areas have more issues with drag, as they can act like a sail catching the wind. </p>\n\n<p>To add to this complexity, streams of particles and magnetic fields from the Sun – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-solar-storms-and-the-solar-wind-3-astrophysicists-explain-how-particles-coming-from-the-sun-interact-with-earth-264013\">known as space weather</a> – can cause the density of air particles in low Earth orbit to fluctuate in unpredictable ways. These fluctuations directly affect orbital drag. </p>\n\n<p>When satellites are spaced less than 200 meters apart, the margin for error evaporates. A single impact could not only destroy one satellite but send it blasting into its neighbors, triggering a cascade that could wipe out the entire cluster and randomly scatter <a href=\"https://dlmultimedia.esa.int/download/public/videos/2021/04/006/2104_006_BR_006.mp4\">millions of new pieces of debris</a> into an orbit that is already a minefield.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of active avoidance</h2>\n\n<p>To prevent crashes and cascades, satellite companies could adopt a <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite/Fly_Your_Satellite_Zero_Space_Debris_Policy\">leave no trace</a> standard, which means designing satellites that do not fragment, release debris or endanger their neighbors, and that can be safely removed from orbit. For a constellation as dense and intricate as Suncatcher, meeting this standard might require equipping the satellites with “<a href=\"https://www.aerospacetestinginternational.com/features/radar-and-robotic-solutions-take-shape-for-space-debris-removal.html\">reflexes” that autonomously detect</a> and dance through a debris field. Suncatcher’s current design doesn’t include these active avoidance capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>In the first six months of 2025 alone, SpaceX’s Starlink constellation performed a staggering <a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/heavy-traffic-ahead/\">144,404 collision-avoidance maneuvers</a> to dodge debris and other spacecraft. Similarly, Suncatcher would likely encounter debris larger than a grain of sand <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/Analysis_and_prediction\">every five seconds</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today’s object-tracking infrastructure is generally limited to debris larger than a softball, leaving <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/feature-articles/rubble-trouble\">millions of smaller debris pieces</a> effectively invisible to satellite operators. Future constellations will need an onboard detection system that can actively <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/the-next-generation-of-radar-needed-to-detect-micro-debris-and-enable-a-safer-leo/\">spot these smaller threats</a> and maneuver the satellite autonomously in real time. </p>\n\n<p>Equipping Suncatcher with active collision avoidance capabilities would be an engineering feat. Because of the tight spacing, the constellation would need to respond as a single entity. Satellites would need to reposition in concert, similar to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nAzNbWKWhBI\">a synchronized flock of birds</a>. Each satellite would need to react to the slightest shift of its neighbor.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUKabPRalhk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Detecting space debris in orbit can help prevent collisions.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Paying rent for the orbit</h2>\n\n<p>Technological solutions, however, can go only so far. In September 2022, the Federal Communications Commission created a rule requiring satellite operators to remove their spacecraft from orbit <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-new-5-year-rule-deorbiting-satellites-0/starks-statement\">within five years of the mission’s completion</a>. This typically involves a controlled de-orbit maneuver. Operators must now reserve enough fuel to fire the thrusters at the end of the mission to lower the satellite’s altitude, until atmospheric drag takes over and the spacecraft burns up in the atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>However, the rule does not address the debris already in space, nor any future debris, from accidents or mishaps. To tackle these issues, some policymakers have proposed a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/24/space-is-filling-up-with-garbage-heres-why-we-should-tax-it/\">use-tax for space debris removal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A use-tax or orbital-use fee would charge satellite operators a levy based on the orbital stress their constellation imposes, much like larger or heavier vehicles paying greater fees to use public roads. These funds would finance <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/Active_debris_removal\">active debris removal missions</a>, which capture and remove the most dangerous pieces of junk.</p>\n\n<p>Avoiding collisions is a temporary technical fix, not a long-term solution to the space debris problem. As some companies look to space as a new home for data centers, and others continue to send satellite constellations into orbit, new policies and active debris removal programs can help <a href=\"https://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/2020.07.pdf\">keep low Earth orbit open for business</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270410/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti receives funding from NASA and Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).

For example, after tuition, federal money allocated <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf23303\">for research</a> made up 40% of the total revenue for two major research <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-much-federal-funding-do-colleges-and-universities-receive\">universities – Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> – in the 2022-23 academic year. </p>\n\n<p>Since January 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/mapping-federal-funding-cuts-to-us-colleges-and-universities/\">Trump administration has terminated various federal grants</a> for universities valued between US$6.9 billion and $8.2 billion. </p>\n\n<p>While there’s been a lot of public attention to the federal government’s financial pressure on universities, universities have been experiencing financial pressure from other sources. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding that is key for applicants and parents to understand their bargaining position when choosing whether and where to pursue a college degree.</p>\n\n<p>As scholars of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WJj8AC0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">public administration</a> and economics and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EoeScNMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">former university administrators</a>, we think parents and college applicants need to understand this economic landscape to make smart choices about making such a major investment. Here are four key things to know. </p>\n\n<h2>1. Universities are an industry</h2>\n\n<p>Most American private colleges and universities are nonprofits, but they still care about revenue. These schools aren’t responsible to shareholders, but they may respond to pressure from alumni, students, employees, donors, boards, the federal government and, if the schools are public universities, state governments. </p>\n\n<p>And like businesses, nonprofit colleges and universities need money. As a result, despite what you might think, <a href=\"https://www.collegeraptor.com/getting-in/articles/college-admissions/4-year-colleges-with-open-admission/\">most colleges</a> are not particularly selective. Though they don’t advertise that fact, hundreds of schools will take any student who meets minimal academic requirements and can pay tuition. </p>\n\n<p>The added cost of teaching additional students is minimal when there are empty seats, so admitting more students can lead to an increase in revenue for most schools.</p>\n\n<p>This is important because colleges’ costs – largely staff salaries and building maintenance – are hard to cut and are mostly fixed. Those costs must be spread across fewer students when there are unfilled seats.  </p>\n\n<p>As the number of people <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5246200/demographic-cliff-fewer-college-students-mean-fewer-graduates\">who go to college is declining</a>, colleges need to respond to people’s skepticism about the value of degrees – but change is difficult  </p>\n\n<p>Becoming a smaller school is challenging. If students show less interest in foreign language study and more interest in data science classes, the school cannot have a German language professor suddenly teach data science. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, colleges can become stuck with faculty who teach course students don’t want to take. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike business leaders, who may be rewarded for fixing a failing company by laying off workers, university leaders who eliminate faculty positions become unpopular among their peers. This can reduce their chance to advance their careers at their current universities or switch to a new school. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705668/original/file-20251201-56-8arll1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young woman hangs a plant under a lofted bed with a brick wall against it.

Schools have to work to admit students</h2>\n\n<p>Colleges <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics\">enrolled 8.4% fewer students</a> in 2024 than when attendance peaked at 21 million in 2010. As a result, schools must increasingly compete harder to attract students. </p>\n\n<p>One way is to offer a better price, meaning lower tuition. Like most elite schools, Harvard has a listed price of <a href=\"https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/tuition-and-fees\">about $60,000</a> for tuition alone in one academic year – and nearly $87,000 when food, housing and other services are included. <a href=\"https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid\">Few students actually pay that</a> amount, though the exact percentage getting a discount is not public information. </p>\n\n<p>The average net price a Harvard student paid in 2023-24 was <a href=\"https://collegeiq.com/colleges/harvard-university/financials\">$17,900, as colleges</a> offered either financial aid, straight-up discounts or scholarships. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/90/3/1228/6651855\">Most schools</a> engage in this <a href=\"https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2021/NACUBO-Tuition-Discounting-Study\">sort of price discrimination</a>, the term economists use to describe charging different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay. In some ways, this is much like airlines selling seats on the same flights at different prices. </p>\n\n<h2>3. Schools have a declining foreign customer base</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10832447/\">Another enrollment remedy</a> for colleges and universities to boost tuition revenue has been focusing on admitting international students, who <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/discrimination-chinese-students-us\">typically pay full</a> price. </p>\n\n<p>One-fourth of all <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/discrimination-chinese-students-us\">international students</a> in the U.S. come from China, while another <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-in-four-international-students-in-us-were-from-india-at-4-2-lakh-indian-students-fuelled-surge-in-numbers-during-2024/articleshow/121681122.cms#:%7E:text=In%202024%2C%20there%20were%2015.8%20lakh%20international,27%25%20of%20the%20total%20foreign%20student%20population\">quarter come from India</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Most schools have not pursued this strategy of expanding foreign enrollment as aggressively as <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/trumps-immigration-policies-threaten-columbias-core-revenue-source/articleshow/121263634.cms?from=mdr\">Columbia University</a>, where international students approach <a href=\"https://standcolumbia.org/2025/05/31/issue-049-columbias-student-body-is-39-international-that-creates-risks-and-opportunities/\">40% of the student body</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>By comparison, <a href=\"https://opir.columbia.edu/sites/opir.columbia.edu/files/content/Columbia%20Facts/Facts_2011.pdf\">international undergraduate students made up</a> 6% of Columbia’s undergraduate student population in 2000, and 12% in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>But the revenue that international students generate is not a guarantee. Foreign student enrollment declined <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/11/17/fewer-international-students-came-us-fall\">17% from fall of 2024 to 2025</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In part, that’s because of some students’ <a href=\"https://stateline.org/2025/11/05/some-public-universities-report-fewer-international-students-amid-trump-restrictions/\">inability to get a visa</a> or fear their authorization to study in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o\">will be revoked</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Rising competition from universities in <a href=\"https://en.amb.ltd/resources/as-trump-wavers-canada-the-uk-and-australia-face-their-own-enrollment-tests\">Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom</a>, combined with stricter U.S. visa policies and geopolitical tensions with China, have led to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/11/17/fewer-international-students-came-us-fall\">rapid declines</a> in Chinese students enrolling at American schools. </p>\n\n<p>The number of Chinese <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/discrimination-chinese-students-us\">undergraduate and graduate students</a> attending U.S. colleges and universities has dropped from 317,299 in 2019 to 265,919 in the 2024-25 school year. </p>\n\n<p>This change has increased the financial strain on American colleges and universities, many of which have grown accustomed to having large numbers of international students who pay their own way.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705665/original/file-20251201-66-k60gjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of young people wear light blue graduation robes and throw their caps into the air.

This amount goes up to $39,608 10 years after graduation, resulting in a negative $324,210 return on the price of college over that first decade. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, some degrees pay off. A University of Texas at Arlington graduate with a degree in civil engineering earns an average of $67,920 one year after college and $105,377 10 years after graduation, demonstrating a positive return on investment of <a href=\"https://freopp.org/roi-in-higher-education/roi-undergraduate/\">$1.15 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We believe that universities and colleges should reform to address the next generation’s uncertainty about higher education. </p>\n\n<p>College applicants should be asking hard questions. What is the data on graduates’ earnings compared to the cost of their program? Where are graduates employed? </p>\n\n<p>If more people treated buying a college degree with the same care they use to buy their first home – an equivalent investment – colleges and universities would feel pressure to become more transparent for students and parents. They would also become more aligned with the rapidly evolving demands of the workplace.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268974/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

When these memoranda, like NSPM-7, relate to national security and military and foreign policy, they are called <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11358\">national security directives</a>, although the specific name of these directives changes with each administration. </p>\n\n<p>Many of these directives are classified. They <a href=\"https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/10-Duncan-Book-2-Vol.-35.pdf\">may not be declassified</a>, if at all, until years or decades after the end of the administration that issued them.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>The stated purpose of NSPM-7 is to counter domestic terrorism and organized political violence, focusing mainly on perceived threats from the political left. The memorandum identifies “anti-Christian,” “anti-capitalism” or “anti-American” views as potential indicators that a group or person will commit domestic terrorism. </p>\n\n<p>The memorandum claims that political violence originates with “anti-fascist” groups that hold the following views: “support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” </p>\n\n<p>The strategy laid out in NSPM-7 includes <a href=\"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs\">preemptive measures</a> to disrupt groups before they engage in violent political acts. For example, multiagency task forces are empowered to investigate potential federal crimes related to radicalization, as well as the funders of those potential crimes. </p>\n\n<h2>‘Domestic terrorist organizations’</h2>\n\n<p>The memorandum directs the Department of Justice to focus the resources of the FBI’s approximately 200 <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism/joint-terrorism-task-forces\">Joint Terrorism Task Forces</a> on investigating “acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons” for the purpose of “political violence, terrorism, or conspiracy against rights; and the violent deprivation of any citizen’s rights.” </p>\n\n<p>NSPM-7 also allows the attorney general to propose groups for designation as “domestic terrorist organizations.” That includes groups that engage in the following behaviors: “organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder.” </p>\n\n<p>Existing laws allow the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations\">secretary of state</a> to designate groups as “foreign terrorist organizations” that are then subject to financial sanctions. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-domestic-terrorist-designation-wont-stop-extremism-141258\">But these laws do not permit</a> the president to label domestic groups this way. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A protest with a person in an orange outfit carrying a sign saying 'It's my First Amendment right to be HERE.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705692/original/file-20251201-56-x78xwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Would protesters like these at a Washington, D.C., ‘No Kings’ demonstration be seen as potential domestic terrorists by the Trump administration?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/USNoKingsProtestWashington/92f377aa4343460fb79a761dcbbaab88/photo?vs=false\">Jose Luis Magana/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Defining terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>NSPM-7 marks a major conceptual shift in U.S. counterterrorism policy. Its focus on domestic terrorism significantly departs from historical approaches that primarily targeted foreign threats.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB55/index1b.html\">Earlier presidential directives largely defined terrorism</a> as a foreign threat to be countered through military power, diplomacy and international cooperation. </p>\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/archives/reference/scanned-nsdds/nsdd207.pdf\">Ronald Reagan’s presidency</a>, the U.S. government had treated terrorism as a <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/archives/reference/scanned-nsdds/nsdd138.pdf\">global menace</a> to democratic institutions, emphasizing protection of citizens and allies abroad. By moving away from a traditional law enforcement framework and <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/reagan-rogue-states-and-problem-terrorism\">recasting terrorism as an act of war</a>, the Reagan administration situated the issue within the broader realm of Cold War geopolitics and military advantage.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, the Clinton administration reframed terrorism as both a foreign policy and domestic security challenge, particularly after high-profile attacks such as the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/world-trade-center-bombing-1993\">1993 World Trade Center bombing</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/oklahoma-city-bombing\">1995 Oklahoma City bombing</a>. Clinton’s policy highlighted the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdd-39.pdf\">transnational networks</a> and the need to defend <a href=\"https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdd-62.pdf\">critical infrastructure</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After the 9/11 attacks, the <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/president/gwbush/foreign-affairs\">Bush administration</a> fused counterterrorism with national defense. The Bush-initiated <a href=\"https://www.georgewbushlibrary.gov/research/topic-guides/global-war-terror\">global war on terrorism</a> expanded the concept of who constituted a threat to include countries that harbored or aided terrorist organizations. </p>\n\n<p>The Obama administration tried to narrow and regulate those powers by embedding counterterrorism within a <a href=\"https://mwi.westpoint.edu/ten-years-after-the-al-awlaki-killing-a-reckoning-for-the-united-states-drones-wars-awaits/\">system of legal rules and procedures</a>. The key question, according to the declassified guidance, was whether the targeted individuals “<a href=\"https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/ppd/ppg-procedures.pdf\">pose a continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>This standard was not focused on ideology but rather on tactical considerations, such as the feasibility of capture and continued threat to U.S. interests. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the lethal drone strike on al-Qaida propagandist <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/2025-02-14/anwar-al-awlaki-file-explained\">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> in 2011 was justified on the basis that he was actively involved in plotting attacks and remained unreachable for capture. </p>\n\n<p>During the first Trump presidency, executive orders were used to change counterterrorism policy, most notably through several iterations of a “<a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/\">travel ban</a>” that attempted to restrict immigration from <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-justifying-list-countries-banned-travel-us/story?id=45143197\">terror-prone</a> countries such as Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-national-security-memorandum-to-counter-weapons-of-mass-destruction-terrorism-and-advance-nuclear-and-radioactive-material-security/\">Biden administration</a> redirected attention toward preventing catastrophic threats, especially from weapons of mass destruction in the hands of groups or individuals outside of governments, such as terrorist organizations.</p>\n\n<h2>First Amendment rights at risk</h2>\n\n<p>There is no single official definition of terrorism in U.S. law. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, laws use different definitions based on their purpose, whether criminal law or laws relating to intelligence collection or civil liability. </p>\n\n<p>Definitions in all those areas typically focus on identifying <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/999/1/2267352/\">violent or dangerous acts</a> done with the intent to intimidate or coerce civilians or influence government policy. </p>\n\n<p>But more than redefining terrorism, NSPM-7 reorients the machinery of national security toward the policing of belief.</p>\n\n<p>The First Amendment generally <a href=\"https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/enforcement-edge/2025/09/turning-counterterrorism-tools-onto-domestic-policy-targets\">prevents</a> the government from punishing people for unpopular opinions. It also protects the <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/freedom-of-association/\">ability for people to associate</a> to advance public and private ideas <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/naacp-v-alabama/\">in pursuit of political</a>, economic, religious or cultural goals. </p>\n\n<p>The directive’s emphasis on ideological orientations – “anti-Christianity,” “anti-capitalism” and “anti-American” views – as indicators of domestic terrorism potentially jeopardizes <a href=\"https://www.acluaz.org/news/first-amendment-101-an-introduction-to-the-five-freedoms/\">First Amendment rights</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Thirty-one members of Congress <a href=\"https://pocan.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pocan.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-on-nspm-7-to-president-trump.pdf\">sent a letter to Trump</a> expressing “serious concerns” about NSPM-7, warning that it poses “serious constitutional, statutory and civil liberties risks, especially if used to target political dissent, protest or ideological speech.” </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists\">the ACLU warns</a>, any definition of terrorism that includes ideological components risks criminalizing people or groups based on belief rather than based on violence or other criminal conduct. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47885\">Congress has declined</a> to create a domestic complement to the foreign terrorist designation in large part because of the potential for impinging on First Amendment–protected association and speech. </p>\n\n<p>But I fear that chilling speech may be the point.</p>\n\n<h2>Silencing dissent</h2>\n\n<p>NSPM-7 does not authorize new actions in the legal and institutional framework for counterterrorism. It does not criminalize previously legal conduct. </p>\n\n<p>Rather, it states that the Trump administration’s investigative focus will be around the <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-situation--the-nonsense-and-the-menace\">identity and ideology of supposed perpetrators</a>. <a href=\"https://the1a.org/segments/if-you-can-keep-it-trump-hate-speech-and-free-speech/\">Prioritizing investigations</a> into this broad swath of ideologies serves to instill fear, silencing <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/11/04/trump-terrorist-list-nspm7-enemies/\">anti-fascist and other messages in opposition to the Trump administration</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Law professor <a href=\"https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/bonus-180-domestic-terrorism-and\">Steve Vladeck</a> frames this chill as “obeying in advance,” in which organizations self-censor rather than risk investigation, prosecution or defending against the “domestic terrorist” label.</p>\n\n<p>Although left-wing violence has risen in the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/ideological-trends-us-terrorism\">empirical evidence</a> proves that this violence remains at very low absolute levels, well below historical levels of right-wing or jihadist violence. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, most domestic terrorists in the U.S. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367\">are politically on the right</a>, and right-wing attacks account for the vast majority of fatalities from domestic terrorism. </p>\n\n<p>Yet NSPM-7 focuses disproportionately on left-wing ideologies. NSPM-7 departs from prior U.S. counterterrorism frameworks by prioritizing the suppression of ideologically motivated dissent, even in the absence of concrete evidence of violent intent.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269161/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Melinda Haas does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Empathy and reasoning aren’t rivals – they work together. Each one on its own predicts more generous, far-reaching acts of assistance. And when they operate side by side, people tend to help in the fairest ways – not favoring some over others – and in ways that touch the most lives. </p>\n\n<p>We studied two groups that regularly help others at personal cost. One consisted of <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/abigail_marsh\">living organ donors who gave kidneys to strangers</a>. The other included “<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism\">effective altruists</a>,” who use evidence and logic to direct substantial portions of their income or careers toward causes that save the most lives per dollar, such as fighting extreme poverty or preventable illness.</p>\n\n<p>All participants completed survey measures of empathy – essentially, how much they care about and are moved by others’ suffering. They also completed survey measures of reasoning. These assess how often people slow down, reflect and think through things before deciding what to do.</p>\n\n<p>We also examined how these abilities related to a range of altruistic judgments and behaviors, from hypothetical choices – such as deciding whether to help a close friend or a distant stranger – to real-world donations.</p>\n\n<p>On average, organ donors scored higher on empathy, and effective altruists scored higher on reflective reasoning – slowing down and thinking things through. But across all participants, both traits were linked to broader, more outward-looking helping. People with either an elevated heart or head, and especially those with both compared with average adults, tended to support distant others and focus on helping as many people as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Even among organ donors, whose empathic ability is far above average adults’, empathy did not make them biased toward those who were close or familiar. When we measured their altruistic judgments and real-world donations, they were just as likely as average adults, and sometimes even more likely, to favor causes that saved the greatest number of lives.</p>\n\n<p>These patterns <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-6962.2011.00069.x\">challenge the assumption</a> that empathy can narrow moral concern. In practice, we found, empathy can broaden it.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Black woman in a red apron over a blue top walks with an older white woman holding food packets.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705401/original/file-20251130-56-d061rw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Relying on reason alone isn’t enough to inspire people to help strangers.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/volunteer-handing-out-food-at-food-drive-royalty-free-image/533768985?phrase=giving%20%20food%20aid%20&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Jose Luis Pelaez Inc./Digital Vision via Getty Image</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many of today’s most urgent problems – poverty, climate change, global health – depend on motivating people to care about strangers and to use limited resources effectively. </p>\n\n<p>Appeals to empathy alone may inspire giving but not necessarily the most effective giving. Appeals to reason alone can leave people unmoved, as often facts and numbers don’t stir anyone to care. Our findings suggest that the most powerful approach may be to pair empathy’s motivation with reasoning’s direction.</p>\n\n<p>Empathy provides the emotional spark – a reminder that others’ suffering matters. Reasoning helps steer that motivation toward where help will have the greatest impact. Together, they encourage helping that is both compassionate and consequential.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Future research needs to determine how empathy and reasoning can be strengthened in everyday decision-making. Could emotional stories paired with clear evidence about what works best help people choose actions that do the most good?</p>\n\n<p>We also don’t yet know whether people who focus their giving beyond the boundaries of their immediate social circles, like effective altruists, pay any social cost for doing so – perhaps by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672211002773\">inadvertently signaling less investment in close others</a>. Promisingly, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00181-7\">early evidence</a> from organ donors shows that those who help strangers often maintain strong, stable relationships with their closest friends and family members. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, researchers need to rethink how altruism is understood. Psychology lacks a clear framework for explaining how empathy and reasoning work together, for whom they work best, and the situations where they come apart. </p>\n\n<p>Developing that kind of model would reshape how we think about helping – when helping expands, when it stalls, and why. While such core questions remain, the present findings offer reason for optimism. </p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266913/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The research relevant to this article was funded by the John Templeton Foundation.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stylianos Syropoulos does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

His goal? To view the flatness of the Earth from space. This was his third attempt, and tragically it was fatal. Hughes crashed shortly after takeoff and died. </p>\n\n<p>Hughes’ nickname – Mad Mike – might strike you as apt. Is it not crazy to risk your life fighting for a theory that was disproven in <a href=\"https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2006/06/eratosthenes-measures-earth\">ancient Greece</a>? </p>\n\n<p>But Hughes’ conviction, though striking, is not unique. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X09991555\">Across all recorded cultures</a>, people have held strong beliefs that seemed to lack evidence in their favor – one might refer to them as “extraordinary beliefs.” </p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vQq3StQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">evolutionary anthropologists like me</a>, the ubiquity of these kinds of beliefs is a puzzle. Human brains evolved to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X12000477\">form accurate models of the world</a>. Most of the time, we do a pretty good job. So why do people also often adopt and develop beliefs that lack strong supporting evidence? </p>\n\n<p>In a new review in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2025.11.002\">I propose a simple answer</a>. People come to believe in flat Earth, spirits and microchipped vaccines for the same reasons they come to believe in anything else. Their experiences lead them to think those beliefs are true. </p>\n\n<h2>Theories of extraordinary belief</h2>\n\n<p>Most social scientists have taken a different view on this subject. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13869795.2017.1287294\">Supernatural beliefs</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691618774270\">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12441\">pseudoscience</a> have struck researchers as totally impervious to contrary evidence. Consequently, they have assumed that experience is not relevant to the formation of those beliefs. Instead, they’ve focused on two other explanatory factors.</p>\n\n<p>The first common explanation is cognitive biases. Many psychologists argue that humans possess mental shortcuts for reasoning about how the world works. For instance, people are quite prone to seeing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9\">intentions and intelligence</a> behind random events. A bias of this kind might explain why people often believe that deities control phenomena such as weather or illness.</p>\n\n<p>The second factor is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.03.005\">social dynamics</a>: People adopt certain beliefs not because they’re sure that they’re true but because other people hold those beliefs, or they want to signal something about themselves to others. For example, some conspiracy theorists may adopt strange beliefs because those <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33305-w\">beliefs come with a community</a> of loyal and supportive co-believers.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these approaches can partly explain how people come to hold extraordinary beliefs. But they discount three ways that experience, in tandem with the other two factors, can shape extraordinary beliefs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"vast grassy landscape with blue sky and white clouds\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704682/original/file-20251126-62-of64e9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Science says one thing, but your eyes tell you the Earth looks pretty darn flat.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/green-grass-field-royalty-free-image/184615693\">sharply_done/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>1. Experience as a filter</h2>\n\n<p>First, I propose that experience can act as a filter. It determines which extraordinary beliefs can successfully spread throughout a population.</p>\n\n<p>Take the flat Earth theory as an example. We know with absolute certainty that it’s false, but it’s no more or less wrong than a theory that the Earth is shaped like a cone. So what makes flat Earth so much more successful than this equally incorrect alternative?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is as obvious as it seems – the Earth looks flat when you’re standing on it, not cone-shaped. Visual evidence favors one extraordinary belief over the others. Of course, scientific evidence clearly shows that the Earth is round; but it’s not surprising that some people prefer to trust what their eyes are telling them. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Experience as a spark</h2>\n\n<p>My second argument is that experience acts as a spark for extraordinary beliefs. Strange experiences, such as auditory hallucinations, are difficult to explain and understand. So people do their best to explain them – and in doing so, they come up with beliefs that seem fittingly strange. </p>\n\n<p>For this pathway, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-lies-behind-ghosts-demons-and-aliens-according-to-sleep-researchers-93534\">sleep paralysis is a good case study</a>. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-are-some-people-affected-by-sleep-paralysis-121125\">Sleep paralysis</a> happens in the space between sleeping and waking – you feel like you’re awake, but you can’t move or speak. It’s terrifying and quite <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2011.01.007\">common</a>. And interestingly, sufferers usually feel like there’s a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1025373412722\">threatening agent</a> sitting on their chest. </p>\n\n<p>As a scientist, I interpret sleep paralysis as the result of neural confusion. But it’s not difficult to picture how someone without a scientific background – that is, nearly every human being in history – might interpret the experience as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01294\">evidence of supernatural beings</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Experience as a tool</h2>\n\n<p>To me, the third potential route to extraordinary beliefs is especially intriguing. In many cases, people don’t just develop extraordinary beliefs; they develop immersive practices that make those beliefs feel true.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, imagine that you’re a farmer living in the highlands of Lesotho in southern Africa, where I conduct ethnographic fieldwork. You suffer a series of miscarriages, and you want to know why. So you go to a traditional healer – she tells you that you can learn the answer from your ancestors by drinking a <a href=\"https://www.sahumanities.org/index.php/sah/article/view/369\">hallucinogenic brew</a>. You drink the brew. Soon after, you begin to see spirits; they speak to you and explain your misfortune.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Shaman in colorful outfit and necklaces ladles from a clay pot\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704684/original/file-20251126-62-289hwj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A shaman might administer a psychoactive substance that affects how you experience the world around you.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/colombian-shaman-claudino-perez-serves-yage-or-ayahuasca-news-photo/2147842113\">Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Clearly, an experience like this one might reinforce your belief in the existence of spirits. Such immersive practices – such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.70029\">prayer</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2022.2118360\">ritualistic dance</a> and the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ayahuasca-the-shamanic-brew-that-produces-out-of-body-experiences-52836\">religious use of psychoactive substances</a> – create evidence that makes the associated beliefs feel true. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p>Extraordinary beliefs are not inherently good or bad. In particular, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.11.006\">religious beliefs</a> provide meaning, security and a sense of community for billions of people. </p>\n\n<p>But some extraordinary beliefs are sources of serious concern: Misinformation about <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7721433/\">science</a> and <a href=\"https://jd.journals.publicknowledgeproject.org/index.php/jd/article/view/437\">politics</a> is rampant and immensely dangerous. By recognizing how those beliefs are shaped by experience, researchers can find better ways to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2\">combat their spread</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Just as importantly, though, my suggested perspective might encourage more compassion and kinship toward people who hold beliefs that seem very different from yours. They are not “mad” or insincere. Like any other human being, they think the evidence is on their side.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271145/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Elster does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Shadow someone with a job you might want</h2>\n\n<p>I have worked with many college students who are interested in a particular career path, but are not familiar with the job’s day-to-day workings.   </p>\n\n<p>A parent, teacher or another adult in this student’s life could connect them with someone they shadow at work, even for a day, so the student can better understand what the job entails. </p>\n\n<p>High school students may also find that interviewing someone who works in a particular field is another helpful way to narrow down career path options, or finalize their college decisions. </p>\n\n<p>Research published in 2025 shows that <a href=\"https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=97896ee1-7d01-36d8-88d0-e50d0b6cdf41\">high school students who complete an internship</a> are better able to decide whether certain careers are a good fit for them. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Look at the numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Full-time students can pay anywhere from about US<a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/united-states/new-york/cheapest-colleges/\">$4,000 for in-state tuition</a> at a <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-state\">public state school</a> per semester to <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-expensive-colleges/\">just shy of $50,000</a> per semester at a private college or university. The <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year\">average annual cost</a> of tuition alone at a public college or university in 2025 is $10,340, while the average cost of a private school is $39,307. </p>\n\n<p>Tuition <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year\">continues to rise</a>, though the rate of growth has slowed in the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>About 56% of 2024 college graduates had <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/see-how-student-loan-borrowing-has-changed\">taken out loans</a> to pay for college. </p>\n\n<p>Concerns about affording college often come up with clients who are deciding on whether or not to get a degree. <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1141137\">Research has shown</a> that financial stress and debt load are leading to an increase in students dropping out of college. </p>\n\n<p>It can be helpful for some students to look at tuition costs and <a href=\"https://www.onetonline.org/\">project what their monthly student loan payments</a> would be like after graduation, given the expected salary range in particular careers. Financial planning could also help students consider the benefits and drawbacks of public, private, community colleges or vocational schools.</p>\n\n<p>Even with planning, there is no guarantee that students will be able to get a job in their desired field, or quickly earn what they hope to make. No matter how prepared students might be, they should recognize that there are still factors outside their control.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A blue circular maze shows people from above walking on different paths.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704627/original/file-20251125-56-wzvzjp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">No matter what route graduating high school students take, it’s often a stressful period of time.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/group-of-people-standing-on-different-curvy-roads-royalty-free-image/912015726?phrase=college%20choice&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Klaus Vedfelt/Royalty-Free</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>3. Normalize other kinds of schools</h2>\n\n<p>I have found that some students feel they should go to a four-year college right after they graduate because it is what their families expect. Some students and parents see a four-year college as more prestigious than a two-year program, and believe it is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/despite-naysayers-and-rising-costs-data-shows-that-college-still-pays-off-for-students-and-society-overall-267612\">more valuable</a> in terms of long-term career growth. </p>\n\n<p>That isn’t the right fit for everyone, though. </p>\n\n<p>Enrollment at trade-focused schools <a href=\"https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/\">increased almost 20%</a> from the spring of 2020 through 2025, and now comprises 19.4% of public two-year college enrollment. </p>\n\n<p>Going to a trade school or seeking a two-year associate’s degree can put students on a direct path to get a job in a <a href=\"https://obc.edu/should-i-go-to-trade-school-10-benefits-of-trade-schools/\">technical area</a>, such as becoming a registered nurse or electrician. </p>\n\n<p>But there are also reasons for students to think carefully about trade schools. </p>\n\n<p>In some cases, trade <a href=\"https://www.nacacnet.org/career-and-technical-colleges/\">schools are for-profit institutions</a> and have been subjected to federal investigation for wrongdoing. Some of these schools have been fined and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/another-for-profit-college-chain-closes-its-doors/\">forced to close</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it is important for students to consider which path is personally best for them. </p>\n\n<p>Research has shown that job satisfaction has a positive impact on mental health, and having a longer history with a career field leads to higher <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.06.554\">levels of job satisfaction</a>.  </p>\n\n<h2>4. Consider a gap year before shutting down the idea</h2>\n\n<p>One strategy that high school graduates have used in recent years is taking a year off between high school and college in order to better determine what is the right fit for a student. Approximately <a href=\"https://gapyearsolutions.com/blog/still-only-2-3-of-us-students-take-gap-year/\">2% to 3% of high school graduates</a> take a gap year – typically before <a href=\"https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/nscblog/2024-high-school-benchmarks-report-after-gap-year-more-students-enroll-in-college/\">going on to enroll in college</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Some young people may travel during a gap year, volunteer, or <a href=\"https://college.harvard.edu/student-life/student-stories/should-you-consider-taking-gap-year\">get a job</a> in their hometown. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever the reason students take gap years, I have seen that the time off can be beneficial in certain situations. Taking a year off before starting college has also been shown to lead <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4932.2007.00418.x\">to better academic performance</a> in college.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263864/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Pickett does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And on Dec. 2 the American Economic Association, a professional association for economists, announced that it <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/news/aea-statement-dec-2-2025\">had banned Summers from all its activities</a> for the rest of his life.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Four women hold photos of Jeffrey Epstein aloft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705410/original/file-20251130-56-ndudgf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Protesters hold signs bearing photos of convicted sex criminal and Larry Summers confidante Jeffrey Epstein in front of a federal courthouse on July 8, 2019, in New York City.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/protest-group-called-hot-mess-hold-up-signs-of-jeffrey-news-photo/1154615733?adppopup=true\">Stephanie Keith/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Prestigious career is unraveling</h2>\n\n<p>These revelations are leading to the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/18/the-inevitable-collapse-of-larry-summers-00657568\">unraveling of Summers’ prestigious career</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The 70-year-old economist went on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epstein-larry-summers-openai-302a596efd87ab8e725ba8f72eeef84b\">leave from teaching at Harvard on Nov. 19</a>.

And, not for the first time, Summers <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/here-are-9-of-the-most-shocking-revelations-in-the-latest-batch-of-epstein-documents-00649853\">questioned the intelligence of women</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Summers, who is one of the nation’s <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/lawrence-h-summers-force-economic-policy-more-40-years-awarded-2023-siepr-prize\">most influential economists</a>, also complained about the <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/larry-summers-to-step-back-from-public-roles-amid-epstein-backlash-125111801433_1.html\">growing intolerance among the “American elite” of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These comments call into question Summers’ judgment, behavior and beliefs and the power dynamics between him and the women he has mentored.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6VtcuWMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">As a female economist</a> and a board member of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession, I wasn’t surprised by the latest revelations, shocking as they may appear.</p>\n\n<p>After all, it was Summers’ disparaging remarks about what he said was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/education/harvard-president-apologizes-again-for-remarks-on-gender.html\">women’s relative inability to do math</a> that <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2006/02/summers-to-step-down-as-president-at-end-of-academic-year-2/\">led him to relinquish the Harvard presidency</a> in 2006. And researchers have been documenting for years <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/0895330042162386\">the gender bias</a> that pervades the profession of economics.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>A leaky pipeline in higher education</h2>\n\n<p>Summers taught my first-year Ph.D. macroeconomics course before he became a prominent policymaker during the Clinton administration, and he advised me during his office hours. Thankfully I did not experience any sexual harassment, but as an economics doctoral candidate at Harvard in the late 1980s, I did gain firsthand insight into the elitist culture of the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings\">nation’s top economics program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Back then, only about 1 in 5 of the people who earned a Ph.D. in economics in the U.S. were women. This percentage <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-gender-gap-in-economics-is-huge-its-even-worse-than-tech-156275\">rose to 30.5% by 1995</a> and has barely budged since then.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/earned-doctorates/2024\">according to the National Science Foundation</a>, 34.2% of newly minted economics Ph.D.s – about 1 in 3 – in the U.S. were women, a considerably lower share than in other social sciences, business, the humanities and science. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"38R1U\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/38R1U/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>After earning doctoral degrees in economics, women face <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=22178\">a leaky pipeline in the tenure track</a>, the highest-paid, most secure and prestigious academic jobs. The higher the rank, the lower the representation of women.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, 34% of assistant professors in economics were women, but only 28% of tenured associate professors – the next step on the ladder – were women. And just 18% of tenured full professors in economics were women.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09538259.2024.2303654\">The gender gap is wider in influential positions</a>, such as economics department chairs and the editorial board members of economics journals. As of 2019, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09538259.2024.2303654\">only 24% of the 55,035 editorial board members</a> of economics journals were women. A brief look at the websites of the <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.usecondept.html\">top 10 economics departments</a> in late 2025 indicates that only one of those 10 department chairs is a woman. </p>\n\n<p>Publication patterns also reflect this inequality. Women are substantially underrepresented as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueac032\">authors in the top economics journals</a>, and this imbalance is not explained by quality differences. Rather, studies have found that women face higher hurdles in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz035\">peer review</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323364\">departmental support</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2019.1644420\">finding productive co-authors</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Chilly climate</h2>\n\n<p>The data paints a clear picture of systemic bias in the profession’s practices and culture. That bias influences who succeeds and who is sidelined.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019\">A 2019 survey by the American Economic Association</a>, documented widespread sexual discrimination and harassment. Almost half of the women surveyed among the association’s members said that they had experienced sexual discrimination that interfered with their careers in some way, and 43% reported having experienced offensive sexual behavior from another economist.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/2023-climate-survey-report\">A follow-up survey in 2023</a> indicated that the association’s new initiatives to improve the professional climate had resulted in little improvement.</p>\n\n<h2>Beyond academia</h2>\n\n<p>Economists can influence policymakers’ decisions on interest rates, taxation and social spending. In turn, the underrepresentation of women in economics can hamper policymaking by limiting the range of perspectives that inform economic decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have found that arguments from female economists are roughly 20% <a href=\"https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17029/do-female-experts-face-an-authority-gap-evidence-from-economics\">more persuasive in shaping public opinion</a> than identical arguments from men.</p>\n\n<p>And yet the gender gap still pervades economics outside academia. At the 12 regional <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-40\">Federal Reserve banks</a>, for example, women constituted just 23% of 411 research track economists in 2022.</p>\n\n<h2>Following its own code of conduct</h2>\n\n<p>“Economists have a professional obligation to conduct civil and respectful discourse in all forums,” the American Economic Association’s <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a> states. The code gives all organizations in economics a clear basis for deciding whether to keep or cut ties with Summers as the AEA has now done. Summers may no longer attend, speak at, or otherwise participate in any AEA-sponsored events or activities. The ban means he can no longer serve “in any editorial or refereeing capacity for AEA journals,” which are the most prestigious academic publications for U.S. economists. </p>\n\n<p>The Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession has called for all economic institutions to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aeacswep.bsky.social/post/3m5yyaf4mh22p\">undertake investigations into Summers’ conduct</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As of early December, the extent to which economic journals and other economics groups are responding to the controversy was still unclear.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that eliminating inequity in economics would take more than an investigation of Summers’ conduct. In my view, institutions and professional associations, including the American Economic Association, should strengthen and enforce codes of conduct that cover harassment, conflicts of interest and misuse of mentorship roles.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I think that Summers’ ties to Epstein are a powerful reminder of why university economics departments need clearer standards and more transparency in hiring, promotions and leadership appointments. Strengthening those standards would help them root out the sexism and other forms of elitism that have historically marked the profession so that academic success is driven more by merit than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.20221667\">self-perpetuating privilege</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the AEA’s announcement, it made little sense to me that the economics profession was claiming to wield authority while tolerating inequity and ethical lapses. I believe that the steps it’s taking toward greater accountability will help to restore trust. </p>\n\n<p><em>This article was updated on Dec. 2, 2025, to include the American Economic Association’s ban on Summers participating in its activities.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270367/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Yana Rodgers serves on the board of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession.

      "content": "<p>When you hear the phrase “family business,” you might think of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhndAirL4tM\">the backstabbing Roys</a> of “Succession” or <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/feature/yellowstone-character-guide-dutton-family-tree-1235593911/\">the dysfunctional Duttons</a> of “Yellowstone.” But while TV’s family companies are entertaining, their real-life counterparts may be even more compelling.</p>\n\n<p>Around the world, family businesses produce <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/business-model-reinvention/family-business-survey.html\">about two-thirds of all economic output</a> and employ <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/business-model-reinvention/family-business-survey.html\">more than half of all workers</a>. And they can be very profitable: The world’s 500 largest family businesses <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/family-enterprise/family-business-index\">generated a collective US$8.8 trillion</a> in 2024. That’s <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=DE\">nearly twice</a> the gross domestic product of Germany. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re not steeped in family business research – and even if you are – their ubiquity might seem a little strange. After all, families can come with drama, conflict and long memories. That might not sound like the formula for an efficient company.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.louisville.edu/vitaliy.skorodziyevskiy/about\">We</a> <a href=\"https://www.business.msstate.edu/directory/jjc97\">are</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRachUAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">researchers</a> who study family businesses, and we wanted to understand why there are so many of them in the first place. In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063251355258\">our recent article</a> published in the Journal of Management, we set out to understand this different kind of “why” – not just the purpose of family firms, but why they thrive around the world.</p>\n\n<h2>The usual answers don’t really explain it</h2>\n\n<p>The standard answer to “Why do family companies exist?” is straightforward: They allow owners to generate income and potentially create a <a href=\"https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/family-businesses-adapt-next-generation\">legacy for future generations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A related question is: “Why do entrepreneurs even want to involve their relatives in their new ventures?” Research suggests entrepreneurs do so because family members care and can help <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-family-members-in-a-small/455420\">when resources are limited</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But that might not be unique to family businesses. All companies – whether run by a family or corporate executives – balance short-term profit and long-term goals. And all of them want reliable workers who are willing to pitch in. </p>\n\n<p>So those answers don’t explain why family companies, specifically, are so common worldwide.</p>\n\n<h2>A different angle: Winning without fighting</h2>\n\n<p>For our study, we considered decades of research about family firms to conclude that family businesses are uniquely skilled at keeping competitors out of their market space – often without actually competing with them. </p>\n\n<p>How? We think a quote from Sun-Tzu’s “<a href=\"https://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html\">The Art of War</a>” captures the idea: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Family-owned businesses often do exactly this, which is why there are so many of them. Here’s how it works in practice: </p>\n\n<h2>Three key differences</h2>\n\n<p>Research on family businesses has shown that they differ from other types of companies in three key ways: <a href=\"https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/blog/2025/10/29/purpose-agility-legacy-ward-center-pwc-survey/\">the types of goals they pursue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ifc.org/content/dam/ifc/doc/mgrt/family-business-governance-handbook.pdf\">the governance structures they establish</a>, and <a href=\"https://digital.ffi.org/editions/a-strong-owners-team-an-asset-for-the-family-business/\">the resources they have</a>. Together, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/mor.2024.73\">these three characteristics</a> explain how family businesses may use their property rights to get an edge over their competitors.</p>\n\n<p>The first is <strong>goals.</strong> Unlike other types of enterprises, family businesses prioritize noneconomic goals involving the reputation, legacy and well-being of the family – <a href=\"https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/blog/2025/10/29/purpose-agility-legacy-ward-center-pwc-survey/\">both now and in the future</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, they still have to worry about making a profit. But their interest in family-centered goals can lead them to choose projects that may yield lower returns but still fulfill their noneconomic goals. These sorts of projects may not be attractive to other types of firms. As a result, family businesses may find themselves operating in spaces where there’s not much competition to start with. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, take Corticeira Amorim, <a href=\"https://www.theceomagazine.com/executive-interviews/resources-forestry/antonio-rios-de-amorim/\">a family-run Portuguese company</a> that dominates the global market for cork stoppers and other cork products. The cork industry is a classic narrow niche: There are only a handful of serious global competitors, and Amorim is widely described as the world’s largest cork processing group, with a sizable share of global wine and Champagne corks. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_zBkqBTFtE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=288\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">CEO Antonio Rios de Amorim discusses the history of his family business in this Business Insider video.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The second key factor is <strong>governance</strong>. Family members who work together often <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/eric-holtzclaw/9-reasons-why-working-with-family-and-friends-is-a-good-idea.html\">know each other well</a>, care about each other and want the best for both the family and the firm, which may stay in the family’s possession for generations. This fact may reduce operating costs and the cost of contracting. </p>\n\n<p>Why? When they make decisions, they don’t always need to hire a fancy, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacr7EI-1JA\">Harvey Specter</a>-like lawyer from the show “Suits.” They can decide on the next move for the company while having dinner together. This significantly reduces the costs associated with decision-making. In other words, because they rely less on formal contracts and monitoring, family businesses can operate more cheaply. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, family firms use <strong>resources</strong> like information and money differently. Since many established family businesses have been around for decades, relatives who work together accumulate information that’s hard to acquire and transfer, and might not even be useful elsewhere. Being a family member means not only doing business with relatives but also going through life together acquiring a unique perspective about the family itself. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, family businesses have lower transaction costs than other companies. Sometimes this shows up in very concrete ways. An uncle may invest money in the business and never ask for it back. Would that happen at a nonfamily business? Probably not. This dedication makes family members a special type of human asset that’s hard to replace. </p>\n\n<p>Put simply, nonfamily businesses are unlikely to hire someone who cares as much about the company’s success as a deeply invested relative does. And because these relationships aren’t for sale on the open market, competitors can’t easily access them. That fact helps family businesses keep competitors at bay while essentially being themselves – which in turn explains why there are so many of them. </p>\n\n<p>Family businesses are so common worldwide that there are several holidays celebrating them, including <a href=\"https://www.familybusinessunited.com/international-family-business-day\">International Family Business Day</a> on Nov. 25, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/stories/mom-and-pop-business-owners-day.html\">U.S. National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day</a> on March 29 and the United Nations’ <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/micro-small-medium-businesses-day\">Micro-, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Day</a> on June 27.

To put that in perspective, the average large natural gas power plant built in the U.S. generates <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860m/\">less than 1,000 megawatts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the power for these data centers comes from fossil fuels, they can become major sources of climate-warming emissions in the atmosphere – unless the power plants capture their greenhouse gases first and then lock them away.</p>\n\n<p>Google recently entered into a unique corporate power purchase agreement to support the <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/first-carbon-capture-storage-project/\">construction of a natural gas power plant</a> in Illinois designed to do exactly that through carbon capture and storage.</p>\n\n<p>So how does carbon capture and storage, or CCS, work for a project like this?</p>\n\n<p>I am an engineer who wrote <a href=\"https://shop.elsevier.com/books/introduction-to-modeling-simulation-and-optimization-of-co2-sequestration-in-various-types-of-reservoirs/agarwal/978-0-443-15331-0\">a 2024 book about various types of carbon storage</a>. Here’s the short version of what you need to know.</p>\n\n<h2>How CCS works</h2>\n\n<p>When fossil fuels are burned to generate electricity, they <a href=\"https://ugc.berkeley.edu/background-content/burning-of-fossil-fuels/\">release carbon dioxide</a>, a powerful greenhouse gas that remains in the atmosphere for centuries. As these gases accumulate in the atmosphere, they <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/\">act like a blanket</a>, holding heat close to the Earth’s surface. Too high of a concentration heats up the Earth too much, <a href=\"https://wmo.int/about-us/world-meteorological-day/wmd-2022/climate-change-and-extreme-weather\">setting off climate changes</a>, including worsening heat waves, rising sea levels and intensifying storms.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon capture and storage involves capturing carbon dioxide from power plants, industrial processes or even directly from the air and then transporting it, often through pipelines, to sites where it can be safely injected underground for permanent storage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration showing pipes from oil pumps and power plants to underground layers\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=710&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=710&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=710&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=892&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=892&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703697/original/file-20251120-56-ubr0c2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=892&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A snapshot of some of the ways carbon capture and storage works.

Once injected deep underground, the carbon dioxide can become permanently trapped in the geologic structure, dissolve in brine or become mineralized, turning it to rock.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of carbon storage is to ensure that carbon dioxide can be kept out of the atmosphere for a long time.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of underground carbon storage</h2>\n\n<p>There are several options for <a href=\"https://shop.elsevier.com/books/introduction-to-modeling-simulation-and-optimization-of-co2-sequestration-in-various-types-of-reservoirs/agarwal/978-0-443-15331-0\">storing carbon dioxide underground</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2202397120\">Depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs</a> have plentiful storage space and the added benefit that most are already mapped and their limits understood. They already held hydrocarbons in place for millions of years.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon dioxide can also be injected into working oil or gas reservoirs to push out more of those fossil fuels while leaving most of the carbon dioxide behind. This method, known as <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/enhanced-oil-recovery\">enhanced oil and gas recovery</a>, is the <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/resources/global-status-report/\">most common one</a> used by carbon capture and storage projects in the U.S. today, and <a href=\"https://www.ciel.org/issue/carbon-capture-and-storage/\">one reason CCS draws complaints</a> from environmental groups.</p>\n\n<p>Volcanic <a href=\"https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/glossary/basalt.html\">basalt rock</a> and <a href=\"https://geologyistheway.com/sedimentary/carbonate-rocks/\">carbonate formations</a> are considered good candidates for safe and long-term geological storage because they contain calcium and magnesium ions that interact with carbon dioxide, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58729-w\">turning it into minerals</a>. Iceland <a href=\"https://www.carbfix.com/how-it-works\">pioneered this method</a> using its bedrock of volcanic basalt for carbon storage. Basalt also covers most of the oceanic crust, and scientists have been exploring the potential for <a href=\"https://undark.org/2024/02/19/carbon-seafloor/\">sub-seafloor storage reservoirs</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTTV71Cd4zo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">How Iceland uses basalt to turn captured carbon dioxide into solid minerals.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the U.S., a fourth option likely <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131744\">has the most potential</a> for industrial carbon dioxide storage – deep saline aquifers, which is what Google plans to use. These widely distributed aquifers are porous and permeable sediment formations consisting of sandstone, limestone or dolostone. They’re filled with highly mineralized groundwater that cannot be used directly for drinking water but is very suitable for storing CO2. </p>\n\n<p>Deep saline aquifers also have large storage capacities, ranging from about 1,000 to 20,000 gigatons. In comparison, the nation’s <a href=\"https://globalcarbonbudget.org/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2025/\">total carbon emissions from fossil fuels in 2024</a> were about 4.9 gigatons.</p>\n\n<p>As of fall 2025, <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Global-Status-of-CCS-2025-report-9-October.pdf\">21 industrial facilities</a> across the U.S. used carbon capture and storage, including industries producing natural gas, fertilizer and biofuels, according to the Global CCS Institute’s 2025 report. Five of those use deep saline aquifers, and the rest involve enhanced oil or gas recovery. Eight more industrial carbon capture facilities were under construction. </p>\n\n<p>Google’s plan is unique because it involves a power purchase agreement that makes building the power plant with carbon capture and storage possible.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"s257l\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s257l/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Google’s deep saline aquifer storage plan</h2>\n\n<p>Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/first-carbon-capture-storage-project/\">400-megawatt natural gas power plant</a>, to be built with <a href=\"https://lowcarboninfra.com/houston-based-energy-transition-company-to-build-innovative-power-steam-facility-in-illinois/\">Broadwing Energy</a>, is designed to capture about 90% of the plant’s carbon dioxide emissions and pipe them underground for permanent storage in a deep saline aquifer in the nearby <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2010.03.001\">Mount Simon sandstone formation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Mount Simon sandstone formation is a huge saline aquifer that lies underneath most of Illinois, southwestern Indiana, southern Ohio and western Kentucky. It has a layer of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2010.03.001\">highly porous and permeable sandstone</a> that makes it an ideal candidate for carbon dioxide injection. To keep the carbon dioxide in a supercritical state, that layer needs to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-020-01133-3\">at least half a mile (800 meters) deep</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A thick layer of Eau Claire shale sits above the Mount Simon formation, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-02/HGCS_Project_Narrative.pdf\">serving as the caprock</a> that helps prevent stored carbon dioxide from escaping. Except for some small regions near the Mississippi River, Eau Claire shale is considerably thick – more than 300 feet (90 meters) – throughout most of the Illinois basin.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1306/13171243St592566\">estimated storage capacity</a> of the Mount Simon formation ranges from 27 gigatons to 109 gigatons of carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p>The Google project plans to use an existing injection well site that was part of the first large-scale carbon storage demonstration in the Mount Simon formation. Food producer Archer Daniels Midland <a href=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/standalone-pages/adm-and-carbon-capture-and-storage/\">began injecting carbon dioxide</a> there from nearby corn processing plants in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon capture and storage has had challenges as the technology developed over the years, including a <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2022-05/Failure%20Investigation%20Report%20-%20Denbury%20Gulf%20Coast%20Pipeline.pdf\">pipeline rupture</a> in 2020 that forced evacuations in Satartia, Mississippi, and caused several people to lose consciousness. After a recent <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-orders-archer-daniels-midland-ensure-environmental-compliance-carbon-sequestration\">leak deep underground at the Archer Daniels Midland site</a> in Illinois, the Environmental Protection Agency in 2025 required the company to improve its monitoring. Stored carbon dioxide had migrated into an unapproved area, but no threat to water supplies was reported.</p>\n\n<h2>Why does CCS matter?</h2>\n\n<p>Data centers are expanding quickly, and utilities will have to build more power capacity to keep up. The artificial intelligence company OpenAI is urging the U.S. to <a href=\"https://openai.com/global-affairs/seizing-the-ai-opportunity/\">build 100 gigawatts</a> of new capacity every year – doubling its current rate.</p>\n\n<p>Many energy experts, including the International Energy Agency, believe <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/ccus-in-the-transition-to-net-zero-emissions\">carbon capture and storage will be necessary</a> to slow climate change and keep global temperatures from reaching dangerous levels as energy demand rises.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270425/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ramesh Agarwal does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This way, the increased saliva production that occurs while eating can help wash away sugars and neutralize acids in your mouth. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, avoid snacking on sweets and sugary drinks throughout the day, especially those containing table sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Continually exposing your mouth to sugar will keep its acidity level higher for longer periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, remember to brush regularly, especially after meals, to remove as much dental plaque as possible.

Higher-speed rail is somewhere between 90, maybe up to 125 mph (144 to 201 kph). And <a href=\"https://www.hsrail.org/blog/what-is-high-speed-rail/\">high-speed rail</a> is 150 mph (241 kph) or faster. There’s also a difference in the infrastructure for these different rail lines. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything in the U.S. that’s considered high-speed rail?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mattingly:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amtrak-new-high-speed-acela-train-gamechanger-for-northeast-travelers/\">Acela train</a> operates in the <a href=\"https://nec-commission.com/corridor/\">Northeast Corridor</a> and serves Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. In some parts of the corridor, the Acela runs on infrastructure that accommodates the train’s maximum 150 mph (241 kph) speed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why has the U.S. been slow to adopt this?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mattingly:</strong> Except for some in the northeastern U.S., not many cities have enough travel between them and are at the correct distance to support an investment in high-speed rail, because it’s not necessarily going to take a huge number of cars off the road. Trains are not a replacement for auto travel; they compete more directly with air. </p>\n\n<p>High-speed rail competes best with air when the trip is between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3846/16484142.2015.1121517\">one-and-a-half to three hours</a>. Within that range, a train’s door-to-door travel time is <a href=\"https://www.alg-global.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/HSRvsAir.pdf\">typically faster than air</a>. That’s because of the additional security time required for air travel: sitting around in the airport, the time it takes to load and unload and all of that. </p>\n\n<p>For longer distances – more than three hours – the train’s travel time starts to get noncompetitive with air. That’s because for every three or four hours of high-speed rail travel, air travel only takes one hour. </p>\n\n<p>Go lower than that – a trip of less than an hour-and-a-half – and cars become the more attractive choice. </p>\n\n<p><strong>That said, what are the advantages of high-speed rail?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mattingly:</strong> First, the environmental benefit is an advantage. High-speed rail <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/su11041025\">has lower carbon emissions</a> than air travel, especially on a per passenger basis. You can load more people onto a train than most planes. </p>\n\n<p>Then, of course, its speed makes it a viable way to commute when compared with conventional rail. Our current Amtrak system, outside the Northeast Corridor, is really a leisure travel mode, as opposed to business travel mode. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What large-scale projects are in the works here in the U.S.?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mattingly:</strong> Some higher-speed rail is in Florida, and <a href=\"https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2025/07/11/brightline-looking-to-raise--400-million-for-tampa-expansion#:%7E\">Brightline, a private train company</a>, is proposing to improve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/travel/brightline-florida-rail-trains-america.html\">the existing line</a> with more of a high-speed capability. There’s also a proposed line in Texas <a href=\"https://www.kbtx.com/2025/08/11/were-not-going-away-texas-high-speed-rail-investor-says-project-is-shovel-ready/\">to run between Dallas and Houston</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The Texas project has a lot of challenges with eminent domain, which is the right of government to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/enrd/condemnation/land-acquisition-section/history-federal-use-eminent-domain\">take private property for public use</a> after providing compensation. A federal grant to help fund the line <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/14/texas-high-speed-rail-planning-grant-cut/\">was recently terminated</a>, and a strategic partner <a href=\"https://www.houstonpress.com/news/texas-central-hits-another-snag-with-spanish-partners-exit-20590770/\">pulled out of the project</a>. With delays, costs inevitably begin to increase. </p>\n\n<p>California’s <a href=\"https://hsr.ca.gov/high-speed-rail-in-california/central-valley/\">high-speed rail project</a> for its Central Valley actually has about 120 miles (193 kilometers) of track laid down. And it’s working on slowly building that out. There are some other proposals <a href=\"https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/major-projects/cascadia-high-speed-rail-and-i-5-program#:%7E\">in the Pacific Northwest</a>, but those are more ideas than projects at this point.  </p>\n\n<p>When these systems are proposed, they’re often positioned as a replacement for auto travel. But I’m incredibly skeptical that auto travel will significantly decrease with a new public transit mode that deposits you within a larger metropolitan destination, which may not even have the public transportation to take you to your final destination.</p>\n\n<p>Regional networks of high-speed rail could connect more <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-exurbs-exurban-neighborhoods-housing-market-home-prices-values-2021-8\">exurban</a> or rural areas to hub airports and enhance economic development in these regions. In this case, a public high-speed rail system could receive public money, just like the federal government has done <a href=\"https://highways.dot.gov/highway-history/interstate-system/50th-anniversary/history-interstate-highway-system\">with the interstate highway system</a> and all the other road investments that we’ve made over the past century and longer. </p>\n\n<p>But I’m not sure that high-speed rail will be a solution for congested freeways between cities for any place outside of the Northeast Corridor. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your central message about high-speed rail?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mattingly:</strong> I love high-speed rail as a technology. For specific applications, it’s beneficial, especially from an environmental perspective. But the country has to be very careful in its choices on where those public investments in high-speed rail would actually make sense and be worthwhile investments. So I’m hesitant to make large investments without really understanding what the outcomes are. </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sciline.org/\">SciLine</a> is a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit that helps journalists include scientific evidence and experts in their news stories.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266205/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephen Mattingly receives funding from the United States Department of Transportation, National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Federal Aviation Administration, National Science Foundation, Texas Department of Transportation, Oregon Department of Transportation, Washington Department of Transportation, California Department of Transportation, Texas General Land Office, North Central Texas Council of Governments, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, City of Arlington, City of Dallas and Caruth Foundation. \n\nStephen Mattingly is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Institute of Transportation Engineers, Transportation Research Board, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the president of the International Professional Association for Transport &amp; Health.</span></em></p>",

Chief among them is the “pick one” <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Plurality_voting_system\">plurality voting system</a> – also called winner-take-all – used to elect nearly all of the 520,000 government officials in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>In this system, voters select one candidate, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes wins.</p>\n\n<p>Plurality voting is notorious for producing winners <a href=\"https://fairvote.org/new-fairvote-reports-show-the-flaws-in-american-primaries/\">without majority support</a> in races that have more than two candidates. It can also create spoilers, or losing candidates whose presence in a race alters the outcome, as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1561/100.00005039\">Ralph Nader’s did in the 2000 presidential election</a>. And it can result in vote-splitting, where similar candidates divide support, paving the way for a less popular winner. This happened in the <a href=\"https://fairvote.org/new_polls_show_that_gop_split_vote_problem_continues/\">2016 Republican primaries</a> when Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich split the anti-Donald Trump vote. </p>\n\n<p>Plurality can also encourage dishonest voting. That happens when voters are pressured to abandon their favorite candidate for one they like less but think can win. In the 2024 elections, for example, voters whose preference for president was Jill Stein, <a href=\"https://www.gp.org/stein_ware\">the Green Party nominee</a>, might have instead cast their vote for Democrat Kamala Harris. </p>\n\n<p>An increasingly well-known alternative to plurality voting is <a href=\"https://www.rcvresources.org/what-is-rcv/\">ranked choice voting</a>. It’s used statewide in <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/elections-voting/ranked-choice-voting-frequently-asked-questions\">Maine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php\">Alaska</a> and in dozens of municipalities, including <a href=\"https://vote.nyc/RankedChoiceVoting\">New York City</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Better performance</h2>\n\n<p>Whereas plurality voting allows voters to select only one candidate, ranked choice lets them rank candidates. If a candidate secures a majority of first-place rankings, they are the winner just like they would be under plurality. </p>\n\n<p>But the two systems diverge when there is no majority winner. Plurality simply chooses the candidates with the most first-place votes, while ranked choice voting eliminates the person with the fewest first-place votes and transfers their votes to the next candidate on each ballot. The process is repeated until there is a majority winner. </p>\n\n<p>Ranked choice voting makes use of more information from the voters than plurality, but does it avoid some of the problems plurality suffers from? </p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://mathematics-democracy-institute.org/imd-researchers-begin-a-study-of-ranked-choice-methods/\">a team of mathematicians</a> who recently concluded <a href=\"https://mathematics-democracy-institute.org/empirical-analysis-of-ranked-choice-voting-methods/\">a study</a> aimed at answering this and related questions. We analyzed some 2,000 ranked choice elections from the U.S., Australia and Scotland. We supplemented those real-world results with 60 million simulated elections. </p>\n\n<p>The results were clear: Ranked choice voting performed much better across all the measures we tested, including spoiler, vote-splitting, strength of candidates and strategic voting.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman smiles and places her left hand on a Bible held by a man.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704323/original/file-20251124-56-xa55.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Eugene Peltola Jr. holds the Bible during a ceremonial swearing-in for his wife, U.S. Rep.

And it was 50% more likely to elect an extreme candidate. Plurality, furthermore, was highly susceptible to vote-splitting, while ranked choice voting was nearly impervious to it. </p>\n\n<p>Ranked choice voting picked strong candidates up to 18 times more frequently than plurality voting, where by “strong” we mean candidates who received many first-place votes and also had broad support, even among their noncore supporters. This method also rarely elects a weak or fringe candidate and typically elects a candidate near the electorate’s ideological center.</p>\n\n<p>Ranked choice voting is also more resistant to various forms of strategic behavior such as <a href=\"https://electionscience.org/research-hub/bullet-voting\">bullet voting</a>, where voters choose only one candidate despite the ability to rank more, and <a href=\"https://electowiki.org/wiki/Tactical_voting#Burying\">burying</a>, where voters disingenuously rank an alternative candidate lower in the hopes of defeating them.</p>\n\n<p>Our research also studied the ways in which election systems can influence behavior. In a plurality election, voters are afraid that their ballot could be “wasted” on a candidate who doesn’t have a shot at winning, or that they might contribute to a spoiler. Our study shows that ranked choice voting largely avoids these pitfalls, empowering voters to express their true preferences rather than being strategic. </p>\n\n<p>We found that candidates in ranked choice voting elections do best when they adopt the policies the greatest number of people support, meeting the voters where they are. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_special_election_in_Alaska,_2022\">Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election</a>, for example, Democrat Mary Peltola positioned herself firmly within Alaska’s center-left base – while still embracing some positions considered conservative outside of Alaska. She won by garnering enough second-place votes from supporters of Republican Nick Begich.  </p>\n\n<p>And in the New York mayoral primary in June 2025, Zohran Mamdani won by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/13/mamdani-lander-cross-endorsing-mayor-00405357\">creating a coalition</a> with another progressive candidate, Brad Lander, and occupying a progressive space representing a range of voters. </p>\n\n<p>The Alaska and New York examples highlight some differences with plurality voting, which often favors appealing to a narrow base without the necessity of reaching out beyond it. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person flips through tabulated ballots.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704368/original/file-20251124-68-1cg5kl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Ballots are prepared to be tabulated for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District House election on Nov. 12, 2018, in Augusta, Maine.

But our work shows that these are statistical outliers, occurring fewer than 1% of the time. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, our research shows that ranked choice voting elects candidates with broader support and greater democratic legitimacy than plurality. It therefore seems sensible that voting reform <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/24/democrats-ranked-choice-voting-2028-primaries\">advocates continue to pursue this method</a> as an alternative to plurality voting.</p>\n\n<p>At a time when <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452527/poll-democracy-trump-immigration\">Americans are losing faith</a> in democracy, voters cannot afford systems that hand victory to unrepresentative candidates and force them to play tactical games. The math is in, and the evidence is overwhelming: Plurality voting is broken.

These deaths took place when families faced high stress but also when legal systems should have been well placed to intervene. Multiple children were killed <a href=\"https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2025/10/CDVFRB-Full-Report-2025.pdf\">alongside a sibling or a parent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/kaitsims/research?authuser=0\">researcher studying domestic violence, crime and anti-violence policy</a>, I have watched these numbers with a sense of resignation rather than surprise. </p>\n\n<p>Domestic violence homicide is persistent. Local, state and federal governments <a href=\"https://nnedv.org/resources-library/vawa-and-related-program-appropriations-chart/\">spend millions of dollars each year</a> to operate hotlines, fund shelters and engage in prevention programs for victims of domestic violence. Yet <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/hvus23.pdf\">more than one-third of homicides of women</a> are still perpetrated by intimate partners. And there has been a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2022.4940\">steady increase nationally in domestic violence-related deaths of children</a> over the past 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>It’s clear that something is different about domestic violence that resists our attempts to reduce overall violent crime. But researchers have struggled to identify exactly what those differences are in ways that can inform effective policy. </p>\n\n<p>To start addressing these deaths, we first need to effectively measure them, a task that is more challenging than one might expect.</p>\n\n<h2>Measuring domestic violence</h2>\n\n<p>Studying domestic violence is, at best, difficult — not least because data is highly limited. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers often try to ask causal questions about what works to prevent domestic violence. To do this, they use large-scale national datasets, including the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr\">Uniform Crime Reporting Program</a> and the <a href=\"https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/nibrs-estimates\">National Incident-Based Reporting System</a>. However, these datasets are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-022-00487-2\">often incomplete or have inconsistent reporting from responding agencies</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement may not recognize and interpret a fatality as resulting from domestic violence if abuse was not previously reported. It is particularly challenging to identify whether a death involved dating or sexual partners unless witnesses who knew the victim closely cooperate with the investigation.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the vast majority of victims of domestic abuse <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/wp-content/uploads/media/2022/09/2209-Hotline-LES_FINAL.pdf\">do not contact law enforcement</a> or <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2024/10/23/domestic-violence-likely-underreported\">seek medical care</a>. Often, this is due to fears that police will not believe them or that their abuser will find out. Parents may worry their abuser could take custody of their children, or that calling 911 will instigate child welfare system involvement.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that half of the perpetrators of domestic violence fatalities in Colorado in 2024 <a href=\"https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2025/10/CDVFRB-Full-Report-2025.pdf\">did not have a prior domestic violence-related arrest</a>. Only one-fifth had been previously convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n\n<h2>Domestic violence affects more than intimate partners</h2>\n\n<p>Domestic violence affects <a href=\"https://www.womenagainstabuse.org/education-resources/the-language-we-use#:%7E:text=Domestic%20violence%20refers%20to%20violence,a%20romantic%20or%20dating%20relationship.\">more than intimate partners or spouses</a>. It can also affect siblings, roommates and even neighbors, co-workers or bystanders. These are collateral victims – people harmed by domestic violence without directly being part of the abusive relationship.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJz6tYow1is?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">9News reports on the increase in domestic violence-related deaths in 2024.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://violencefreecolorado.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Domestic-Violence-Report-2024-FINAL-5.pdf.pdf\">Colorado</a> and <a href=\"https://www.endabusewi.org/our-work/homicide-reports/\">Wisconsin</a> have expanded their definition of domestic violence fatalities to account for some of these collateral deaths. For years, Colorado has included <a href=\"https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2025/10/CDVFRB-Full-Report-2025.pdf\">abusers who died by suicide</a>, or whom law enforcement killed in the line of duty, in statewide counts. But states disagree on how wide to cast the net, making comparisons between states difficult.</p>\n\n<p>These fatality reviews are further hamstrung by the boundary between domestic violence and child abuse.</p>\n\n<p>In Colorado, deaths due to child abuse and neglect are counted in the <a href=\"https://coag.gov/office-sections/criminal-justice/domestic-violence-fatality-review-board/\">Domestic Violence Fatality Report</a> only if the death can be <a href=\"https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2023/10/PROTOCOL-MANUAL-DV-FINAL.pdf\">traced to violence between intimate partners</a>. Children can therefore get lost in the count when violence between parents or caregivers is hidden behind closed doors. </p>\n\n<h2>What we don’t know can hurt us</h2>\n\n<p>These data gaps present challenges to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-56276-0_7\">understanding</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-021-00248-7\">predicting</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00243-4\">preventing</a> domestic violence. Policymakers struggle to gather up-to-date information to make effective public safety policy, including over how and when to detain alleged abusers before their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>In Colorado, pretrial detention recommendations are made using a <a href=\"https://capscolorado.org/assets/docs/CPAT_Manual_v1_-_PJI_2013.279135658.pdf\">rigid scoring rubric</a>. This rubric includes the accused’s prior criminal sentences or time served in jail or prison. However, it does not include information about domestic violence protection orders or prior charges that did not result in conviction. </p>\n\n<p>In general, this is a well-intended policy that upholds the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.” But in domestic violence cases, it creates a catch-22. The vast majority of abusers have never been found guilty in court. This can be due to <a href=\"https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/case-dismissed-why-domestic-violence-offenders-often-get-away-with-it\">dropped charges</a>, lack of victim cooperation or unclear evidence. These abusers can have long histories of abusive behavior that aren’t visible to a judge when making pretrial detention decisions. </p>\n\n<h2>Designing effective prevention and response</h2>\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, policymakers have made substantial steps forward.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the national <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2938/text\">Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a> closed the so-called “<a href=\"https://cebcp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TC25-Spring25.pdf\">boyfriend loophole</a>” whereby married individuals convicted of domestic violence offenses were prohibited from gun ownership but dating partners were exempt. This is particularly important given that the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-021-00330-0\">majority of firearm mass shootings</a> in the U.S. are domestic violence-related.</p>\n\n<p>States and counties nationally are improving the <a href=\"https://loyolaccj.org/blog/petitions-to-detain-for-domestic-violence-cases\">way courts assign pretrial detention</a> and arrest and charge offenders. <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/04/03/colorados-mandatory-arrest-law-often-results-in-unintended-consequences/\">Mandatory arrest policies</a> require law enforcement to make an arrest when they suspect abuse. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/1229461\">No-drop orders</a> prevent abusers from intimidating survivors into dropping charges.</p>\n\n<p>However, these laws have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.02.013\">limited effectiveness</a> and introduce new harms, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2008.09.006\">increasing domestic violence homicides</a>. Colorado’s own mandatory arrest law <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/04/03/colorados-mandatory-arrest-law-often-results-in-unintended-consequences/\">has been criticized</a> for increasing arrests of victims of domestic violence. This can <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/decriminalizing-domestic-violence/paper\">threaten victims’ own custody</a> of their children and cause further economic precarity, increasing the risk of lethal violence.</p>\n\n<p>Because laws and law enforcement cannot do everything or support every survivor, solutions must come from outside of the criminal-legal system. <a href=\"https://nnedv.org/content/state-u-s-territory-coalitions/\">Community-based services and programs</a> such as emergency housing, counseling and cash assistance help survivors to overcome barriers to safety. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kufIC9pK4A?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Adams County, Colorado, unveils new Family Justice Center to help domestic violence survivors.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>However, access to these programs and services varies. Not all counties – in Colorado or most other states – have emergency domestic violence shelters. <a href=\"https://time.com/7305918/domestic-violence-support-groups-funding-cuts/\">Recent federal funding cuts</a> threaten many programs’ continued operations. Even when programs exist, local availability of housing and services can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-025-00983-1\">limit service providers’ effectiveness</a> for their adult clients and their children. </p>\n\n<p>Failing to effectively measure, prevent and respond to domestic violence can be a matter of life and death. Given how <a href=\"https://moodle2.units.it/pluginfile.php/93701/mod_resource/content/1/Anderson_Saunders_2003.pdf\">survivors’ needs vary</a>, policymakers need to recognize that policy solutions and programs are not one-size-fits-all. And tailored, local policy solutions require improved data and better resources. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/local\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268836/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kaitlyn M.

Invoking tradition, he led the people in noontime prayer. But rather than reciting it, as his predecessors generally did, he sang. </p>\n\n<p>In chanting the <a href=\"https://www.usccb.org/prayers/regina-caeli\">traditional Regina Caeli</a>, the pope inspired <a href=\"https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2025/08/18/pope-leo-xiv-inspires-a-rebirth-of-gregorian-chant/\">what some have called a rebirth</a> of Gregorian chant, a type of monophonic and unaccompanied singing done in Latin that dates back more than a thousand years.</p>\n\n<p>The Vatican has been at the forefront of that push, launching an online initiative to teach Gregorian chant through short educational tutorials called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRK0IuJlKq8&amp;list=PL1-YYOFc-KJPLnuQ_0p6ZXnybb-RsCrah&amp;index=2\">Let’s Sing with the Pope</a>.” The stated goals of the initiative are to give Catholics worldwide an opportunity to “participate actively in the liturgy” and to “make the rich heritage of Gregorian chant accessible to all.” </p>\n\n<p>These goals resonated with me. As <a href=\"https://artsci.washu.edu/faculty-staff/elinor-harrison\">a performing artist and scientist of human movement</a>, I spent the past decade developing therapeutic techniques involving <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31986952/\">singing</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32878538/\">dancing</a> to help people with neurological disorders. Much like the pope’s initiative, these arts-based therapies require active participation, promote connection, and are accessible to anyone. Indeed, not only is singing a deeply ingrained human cultural activity, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35315920/\">research increasingly shows how good it is for us</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>The same old song and dance</h2>\n\n<p>For 15 years, I worked as a professional dancer and singer. In the course of that career, I became convinced that creating art through movement and song was integral to my well-being. Eventually, I decided to shift gears and study the science underpinning my longtime passion by looking at the benefits of dance for people with Parkinson’s disease. </p>\n\n<p>The neurological condition, <a href=\"https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics\">which affects over 10 million people worldwide</a>, is caused by neuron loss in an area of the brain that is involved in movement and rhythmic processing – the basal ganglia. The disease causes a range of debilitating motor impairments, including walking instability. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An older woman sings from her music sheet.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703603/original/file-20251120-56-fcc2t3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A woman sings as part of a chorus for Parkinson’s patients and their care partners at a YMCA in Hanover, Mass., on Feb. 13, 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/maureen-healy-of-scituate-sings-along-as-part-of-a-newly-news-photo/1127411734?adppopup=true\">David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Early on in my training, I suggested that people with Parkinson’s could improve the rhythm of their steps if they sang while they walked. Even as we began publishing our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.02.008\">initial feasibility studies</a>, people remained skeptical. Wouldn’t it be too hard for people with motor impairment to do two things at once? </p>\n\n<p>But my own experience of singing and dancing simultaneously since I was a child suggested it could be innate. While Broadway performers do this at an extremely high level of artistry, singing and dancing are not limited to professionals. We teach children nursery rhymes with gestures; we spontaneously nod our heads to a favorite song; we sway to the beat while singing at a baseball game. Although people with Parkinson’s typically <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/918719\">struggle to do two tasks at once</a>, perhaps singing and moving were such natural activities that they could reinforce each other rather than distract.</p>\n\n<h2>A scientific case for song</h2>\n\n<p>Humans are, in effect, hardwired to sing and dance, and we likely evolved to do so. In every known culture, evidence exists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0868\">of music, singing or chanting</a>. The oldest discovered musical instruments are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08169\">ivory and bone flutes</a> dating back <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.03.003\">over 40,000 years</a>. Before people played music, they likely sang. The discovery of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.07.006\">60,000-year-old hyoid bone</a> shaped like a modern human’s suggests our Neanderthal ancestors could sing.</p>\n\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300\">The Descent of Man</a>,” Charles Darwin speculated that a musical protolanguage, analogous to birdsong, was driven by sexual selection. Whatever the reason, singing and chanting have been integral parts of spiritual, cultural and healing practices around the world for thousands of years. Chanting practices, in which repetitive sounds <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12111456\">are used to induce altered states of consciousness</a> and connect with the spiritual realm, are ancient and diverse in their roots. </p>\n\n<p>Though the evolutionary reasons remain disputed, modern science is increasingly validating what many traditions have long held: Singing and chanting can have profound benefits to physical, mental and social health, with both immediate and long-term effects. </p>\n\n<p>Physically, the act of producing sound can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-000996\">strengthen the lungs and diaphragm and increase the amount of oxygen in the blood</a>. Singing can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2021.06.004\">reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Vocalizing can even improve your immune system, as active music participation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jmt/39.1.30\">can increase levels of immunoglobulin A</a>, one of the body’s key antibodies to stave off illness. </p>\n\n<p>Singing also improves mood and reduces stress. </p>\n\n<p>Studies have shown that singing lowers cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2016.631\">healthy adults and people with cancer</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1569601\">neurologic disorders</a>. Singing may also rebalance autonomic nervous system activity by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/23268263.2024.2416265\">stimulating the vagus nerve</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.727231\">improving the body’s ability to respond to environmental stresses</a>.

Repetitive chanting, as is common in rosary recitation and yogic mantras, can induce a meditative state, inducing mindfulness and altered states of consciousness. Neuroimaging <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40200-w\">studies show that chanting activates</a> brainwaves associated with suspension of self-oriented and stress-related thoughts.</p>\n\n<h2>Singing as community</h2>\n\n<p>Singing alone is one thing, but singing with others brings about a host of other benefits, as anyone who has sung in a choir can likely attest. </p>\n\n<p>Group singing provides a mood boost and improves overall well-being. Increased levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin during singing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2021.105105\">may promote feelings of social connection and bonding</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When people sing in unison, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024893\">synchronize not just their breath but also their heart rates</a>. Heart rate variability, a measure of the body’s adaptability to stress, also <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00762/full\">improves during group singing</a>, whether you’re an expert or a novice.</p>\n\n<p>In my own research, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33942-6\">singing has proven useful in yet another way</a>: as a cue for movement. Matching footfalls to one’s own singing is an effective tool for improving walking that is better than passive listening. Seemingly, active vocalization requires a level of engagement, attention and effort that can translate into improved motor patterns. For people with Parkinson’s, for example, this simple activity can help them avoid a fall. We have shown that people with the disease, in spite of neural degeneration, activate <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40134419/\">similar brain regions as healthy controls</a>. And it works <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6744333/\">even when you sing in your head</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you choose to sing with the pope or not, you don’t need a mellifluous voice like his to raise your voice in song. You can sing in the shower. Join a choir. Chant that “om” at the end of yoga class. Releasing your voice might be easier than you think. </p>\n\n<p>And, besides, it’s good for you.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262861/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Elinor Harrison received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Grammy Museum Foundation.

Those records suggest <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0012-1\">snowfall has declined</a> in most of the West. We also see evidence of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01014-9\">more midwinter melting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How much snow falls is driven by both temperature and precipitation, and <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/\">temperature is warming</a></p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"ewBGp\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ewBGp/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>In the past few years, research has been able to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06794-y\">directly attribute observed changes</a> in the spring snowpack to human-caused climate change. Rising temperatures have led to decreases in snow, particularly in the Southwest. The effects of warming temperatures on overall precipitation are less clear, but the net effect in the western U.S. is a decrease in the spring snowpack.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-025-01002-2\">climate change projections for the western U.S.</a> in future years, we see with a high degree of confidence that we can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-021-00219-y\">expect less snow in warmer climates</a>. In scenarios where the world produces more greenhouse gas emissions, that’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805953115\">worse for snow seasons</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Should states be worried about water supplies?</h2>\n\n<p>This winter’s forecast isn’t extreme at this point, so the impact on the year’s water supplies is a pretty big question mark.</p>\n\n<p>Snowpack – how much snow is on the ground in March or April – <a href=\"https://eesa.lbl.gov/news/media-resources/snowpack-prediction-factsheet/\">sums up the snowfall</a>, minus the melt, for the year. The snowpack also affects water supplies for the rest of the year.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/snow-water-equivalent-swe-its-importance-northwest\">West’s water infrastructure system</a> was built assuming there would be a natural reservoir of snow in the mountains. California relies on the snowpack for <a href=\"https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2025/Jan-25/Snowpack-Dips-Well-Below-Average-in-Second-Snow-Survey-of-the-Season\">about a third</a> of its annual water supply.</p>\n\n<p>However, rising temperatures are leading to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2012WR011949\">earlier snowmelt in some areas</a>. Evidence suggests that climate change is also expected to cause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0236-4\">more rain-on-snow events</a> at high elevations, which can cause very rapid snowmelt.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705610/original/file-20251201-76-6f5pnn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a man stands on a road that is flooded on both sides as far as the camera can see.

If the snow melts early, water resource managers face some tough decisions, because they also need to leave room in their reservoirs to manage flooding. Earlier snowmelt sometimes means they have to release stored water.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at reservoir levels in the Colorado River basin, particularly the big reservoirs – Lake Powell and Lake Mead – we see a <a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/vCazn/\">pattern of decline over time</a>. They have had some very good snow and water years, and also particularly challenging ones, including a <a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/watersheds/colorado\">long-running drought</a>. The long-term trends suggest an imbalance between supply and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-the-colorado-river-slowly-dries-up-states-angle-for-influence-over-future-water-rights-254132\">growing demand</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"z5mK5\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z5mK5/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What else does snowfall affect, such as fire risk?</h2>\n\n<p>During low-snow years, the snowpack disappears sooner, and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2013WR014452\">soils dry out earlier</a> in the year. That essentially leaves a longer summer dry period and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112233\">more stress on trees</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There is evidence that we tend to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1128834\">bigger fire seasons after low-snow winters</a>. That can be because the forests are left with drier fuels, which sets the ecosystem up to burn. That’s obviously a major concern in the West. </p>\n\n<p>Snow is also important to a lot of wildlife species that are adapted to it. One <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001537\">example is the wolverine</a>, an endangered species that requires deep snow for denning over the winter.</p>\n\n<h2>What snow lessons should people take away from climate projections?</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, climate projections suggest our biggest snow years will be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2320600121\">less snowy in anticipated warmer climates</a>, and that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL083770\">very low snow years</a> are expected to be more common.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s important to remember that climate projections are <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/\">based on scenarios</a> of how much greenhouse gas might be emitted in the future – they are not predictions of the future. The world <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/items/9f0bf855-2069-42a6-a856-4b389f740c5c\">can still reduce its emissions</a> to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/29768659241304854\">create a less risky scenario</a>. In fact, while the most ambitious emissions reductions are looking less likely, the <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/items/9f0bf855-2069-42a6-a856-4b389f740c5c\">worst emissions scenarios are also less likely</a> under current policies. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding how choices can change climate projections can be empowering. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-517-2017\">Projections are saying</a>: Here’s what we expect to happen if the world emits a lot of greenhouse gases, and here’s what we expect to happen if we emit fewer greenhouse gases based on recent trends.</p>\n\n<p>The choices we make will affect our future snow seasons and the wider climate.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated to correct the references to Denver, which saw one of its latest snowfalls on record.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270928/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adrienne Marshall receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States Geological Survey, the Colorado Department of Transportation, and the Alfred P.

For starters, some of these rural students might not have large numbers of elite universities and colleges coming to admissions fairs in their areas. They might not have all of the required high school courses to attend some of these schools, either, according to <a href=\"https://education.msu.edu/people/w/williams-sheneka\">Sheneka Williams</a>, a scholar of educational leadership and rural education who graduated from a small, rural high school in Alabama.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Amy Lieberman, the education editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Williams to understand the particular experiences of rural students – and what, exactly, coming from a rural background can mean as students think about college.</em> </p>\n\n<h2>How are rural high school students’ experiences unique?</h2>\n\n<p>Nationally, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/initiatives/rural-education-resource-center\">nearly 10 million students</a> – or 1 in 5 public school students in the U.S. – attended rural schools in the fall of 2022. </p>\n\n<p>Research suggests that <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/lba/high-school-graduation-rates-rural\">rural students finish or complete high school</a> at a higher rate than urban students. </p>\n\n<p>While approximately 90% of rural high school students graduated in 2020, 82% of urban high school students got their <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/lba/high-school-graduation-rates-rural\">diplomas that year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But rural students’ college entrance rate is lower than that of urban and suburban students. </p>\n\n<p>Within four years of graduating high school, 71% of rural students attended college, compared to 73% of suburban and 71% of city students who also went to college, according to <a href=\"https://pnpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RuralStudents_Mar23.pdf\">2023 findings</a> by the National Center for Education Statistics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/3-myths-about-rural-education-that-are-holding-students-back-239470\">Why are rural students finishing high school</a> at a higher rate than their suburban and urban peers but <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-york/articles/2025-08-02/rural-us-high-schools-are-offering-more-college-level-classes-but-college-can-still-be-a-tough-sell#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20stress%20is%20picking%20an,and%2059%25%20of%20urban%20graduates.\">attending college</a> at a lower rate? </p>\n\n<p>First, we know that some colleges are not really recruiting students in rural areas. If these universities don’t know you exist, and if your parents haven’t gone to college and don’t know how the admission system works, you might not have help as you move closer to attending college. Some <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rural-schools-need-career-counselors-too/\">rural schools also do not</a> have college counselors. </p>\n\n<p>There are other reasons why some rural high school graduates are not going to college, I have personally seen. Some students are apprehensive about leaving home. They have close-knit families and communities, and they might be wondering where they fit in at a school in a large place that is much bigger than where they grew up. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of young people wear red shirts and hold musical instruments, including trumpets, as they walk in the street on a blue-sky day.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704304/original/file-20251124-62-q4jumt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Students in the West Bolivar High School marching band take part in the McEvans School homecoming parade in Shaw, Miss., in September 2022.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/students-in-the-west-bolivar-high-school-marching-band-take-news-photo/1246345838?adppopup=true\">Rory Doyle for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Do any of these scenarios describe your own educational journey?</h2>\n\n<p>I grew up in a small town in Alabama and was different from some of the other Black students, since I came from a family of educators who had gone to college for two generations. </p>\n\n<p>But when I did go to college, I went to a campus that was two times the size of my hometown, which has a population of just 12,000. It takes a confident student, as well as encouragement from parents or mentors, to believe that you can go to school away from home. </p>\n\n<p>We had some college fairs in high school, but the visiting colleges were state universities and regional schools. You did not have selective schools coming to recruit. </p>\n\n<p>Students today can learn about schools online, but there is still the issue that universities are not, on their own, <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/NACAC-5-ways-colleges-improve-outreach-rural-students-small-towns-STARS/728860/.\">connecting enough with rural students</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Do rural students fit into universities’ diversity goals?</h2>\n\n<p>Only recently have people begun to think and talk more about what rural really means. Some people use the U.S. Census Bureau’s <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html\">definition of rural</a>, which is “all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area.”</p>\n\n<p>But that’s a somewhat surface definition. It’s <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/08/redefining-rural.html\">hard for</a> some scholars to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2022.02\">agree on what counts as rural</a>, including me. It feels like something you have to experience and know, and that is hard to define. Part of the issue is that <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/bloomsbury-handbook-of-rural-education-in-the-united-states-9781350172012/\">rural has been defined by what urban is not</a>, and that makes it seem it doesn’t deserve its own definition. </p>\n\n<p>Universities are beginning to think about these rural students more and the particular challenges they experience in school. That includes not necessarily having stable access to high-speed internet, which approximately <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/sustainability/infrastructure/broadband\">22.3% of Americans in rural areas</a> and 27.7% of Americans in tribal areas don’t have, compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is that even for rural students who want to go to college, they might not have the right qualifications, such as certain courses they have completed. </p>\n\n<p>I am currently involved in research with <a href=\"https://education.msu.edu/people/s/schneider-barbara\">sociologists Barbara Schneider</a> and education scholars <a href=\"https://education.msu.edu/people/k/krajcik-joseph\">Joe Krajcik</a> and <a href=\"https://lbc.msu.edu/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/clausell-mathis\">Clausell Mathis</a> about how some rural high schools in Alabama and Mississippi aren’t able to teach physics or chemistry. Physics and chemistry are both gateway courses to college, and if you want to be an engineer or STEM major, you have to complete these courses in order to have a shot at certain colleges.</p>\n\n<p>Rural high schools tend to have a lack of resources, in terms of both budget and their staffing. Schools not being able to find teachers who are qualified or certified in certain subject areas, such as science courses, <a href=\"https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/overview-teacher-shortages-2025-factsheet#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20June,fully%20certified%20for%20their%20assignments.\">is a nationwide problem</a>. But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332858421995514\">this issue is tougher in smaller</a>, rural towns. </p>\n\n<p>Schools will say they don’t have students interested in those subjects. But the states also aren’t requiring that these classes are offered. </p>\n\n<p>This lack of science course offerings can create a whole block of students who are not going to college. And if we are talking about the South, in particular, and states that have a high population of Black students in rural areas, we are talking about a whole swath of students who don’t have this education and would find it a struggle to get into larger, splashier schools that are not near home. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A scoreboard and old-looking building are seen in a brown field.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704305/original/file-20251124-56-7jkxnh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">High school students in rural areas might not have access to the same classes or technology that peers in suburban and urban areas do.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/small-highschool-football-field-and-scoreboard-left-royalty-free-image/1957383561?phrase=rural%20high%20school%20America&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What do you think are some of the solutions to these challenges?</h2>\n\n<p>There are many local efforts to <a href=\"https://www.gse.upenn.edu/news/penn-literacy-network-aims-shake-tutoring-industry-innovative-partnership\">offer tutoring</a> and things of that nature for <a href=\"https://marketbrief.edweek.org/meeting-district-needs/the-critical-tutoring-needs-of-rural-school-systems/2022/11\">rural high school</a> students.

Much like the repressions of the 1930s, they involved fabricated plots, arrests, coerced confessions and purges. Unlike the Terror of the 1930s, they were accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/153615\">a wave of state-sponsored antisemitism</a> – including the purge of Jews from multiple occupations and unwritten quotas that limited their professional and educational opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The abolition of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee on Nov. 20, 1948, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__cydjRCcE\">arrest and execution of its members</a> was central to this postwar assault. The committee’s elimination was accompanied by <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.yivo.org/article/65\">an “anti-cosmopolitan” campaign</a> emphasizing Russian nationalism, Soviet patriotism and anti-Westernism. In certain ways, the campaign served as the mirror image of <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/essays/anti-communism-1950s\">anti-communist and jingoistic propaganda</a> in the United States at the time.</p>\n\n<p>“Rootless cosmopolitan” <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.yivo.org/article/65\">became code for “Jewish</a>,” and dismissals swept the arts, sciences and media. The Ministry of State Security arrested Jewish industrial leaders for sabotage and, in 1953, fabricated “<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Doctors-Plot\">the Doctor’s Plot</a>,” which accused a group of predominately Jewish doctors who treated Kremlin officials of trying to assassinate Stalin and other party leaders.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two side-by-side police images show a dark-haired man in a white shirt and dark suit jacket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704414/original/file-20251125-56-7q5uid.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Peretz Markish, one of many Jewish artists and leaders persecuted in the ‘anti-cosmopolitan’ campaign, was executed on the ‘Night of the Murdered Poets.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peretz_Markish_-_MGB_(USSR)_Prison_photo._1949.jpg\">Central Archive of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (Moscow) via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The very idea of an antisemitic campaign following the <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fortress-dark-and-stern-9780190618414?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">massive Soviet losses in World War II</a> presents an enigma. Of the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, almost 2 million were <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/mass-shootings-of-jews-during-the-holocaust\">murdered by the Nazis on Soviet soil</a>. Why would Soviet leaders, who fought a bitter and costly war to defeat fascism, choose to attack the very group that the Nazis tried to annihilate? </p>\n\n<p>My forthcoming book, “Stalin’s Final Terror: Antisemitism, Nationality Policy, and the Jewish Experience,” addresses this difficult question.</p>\n\n<h2>Clashing with the state</h2>\n\n<p>The Soviet state created <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.yivo.org/article/85\">the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee</a> in 1942 to aid the war effort at home and abroad. Its chairman, <a href=\"https://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/events/great-russian-jews-solomon-mikhoels-1890-1948\">Solomon Mikhoels</a>, was a renowned Yiddish actor and director of the State Yiddish Theater – one of the many cultural and scientific luminaries who led the committee.</p>\n\n<p>The committee made an enormous <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.yivo.org/article/85\">contribution to the war effort</a>, sending thousands of articles about fascism, the Jewish war experience and the Red Army for publication in the foreign press. Mikhoels and <a href=\"https://congressforjewishculture.org/people/1711/Fefer-Itsik\">writer Itsik Fefer</a> toured the United States, Mexico, Canada and Great Britain, where they were welcomed by rapturous crowds and raised millions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>In 1943, as the Red Army began liberating Soviet territories from German occupation, the committee was inundated by <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/articles/academic/stalins-bureaucracy-in-action-the-jewish-anti-fascist-committee.html\">letters from surviving and returning Jews</a>. Committee leaders tried to help people reclaim their homes, to distribute foreign aid and to identify and commemorate sites of Nazi war crimes. They wrote to Stalin suggesting the creation of <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/crimean-affair\">a Jewish national republic in Crimea</a> to replace destroyed communities in Ukraine, Belorussia and Russia.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two balding men in suits flank an older man with white hair in a sweater.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=367&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=367&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=367&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704410/original/file-20251125-64-f5z81o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=462&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee members Itsik Fefer, left, and Solomon Mikhoels, right, speak with Albert Einstein during their international tour.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Itzik_Feffer,_Albert_Einstein_and_Solomon_Mikhoels_1943.jpg\">Mondadori Publishers/Getty Images via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But the state deemed these unsanctioned activities expressions of “bourgeois Jewish nationalism.” Some Communist Party leaders even insinuated that the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was being used by spies, and advocated its elimination.</p>\n\n<p>The minister of state security, V.S. Abakumov, convinced Stalin that Mikhoels was <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/GosudarstvennyyAntisemitizmVSSSROtNachalaDoKulminacii19381953RuLitMe509717/Gosudarstvennyy-antisemitizm-v-SSSR-Ot-nachala-do-kulminacii-1938-1953_RuLit_Me_509717_djvu.txt\">spying for Jewish organizations in the United States</a>, but Mikhoels was <a href=\"https://lechaim.ru/ARHIV/138/kost.htm\">too well known at home and abroad to be arrested</a>. In January 1948, Mikhoels was lured to a house on the outskirts of Minsk, <a href=\"https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/this-week-in-jewish-history--russian-yiddish-actor-solomon-mikhoels-murdered-by-soviet-authorities\">crushed by a truck</a> and dumped on a deserted road.</p>\n\n<p>The murder, disguised as an accident, signaled a turning point in the government’s policy toward Soviet Jews. In November 1948, the government <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13501674.2018.1524737\">abolished the committee</a> as “a center of anti-Soviet propaganda.” Fifteen of its leaders were arrested over the following months. The state shuttered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198184799.003.0005\">the Yiddish publishing house</a>, press, theaters, literary journals and writers association, and arrested hundreds of Yiddish cultural figures.</p>\n\n<h2>Unbowed in court</h2>\n\n<p>The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee’s leaders were charged with bourgeois nationalism, treason and espionage. Tortured in prison and kept in cramped, freezing cells, they were forced to confess.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of State Security hoped to stage a public show trial, but as soon as the physical coercion stopped, the defendants began to <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300104523/stalins-secret-pogrom/\">retract their confessions</a> and write letters of protest. The evidence was based on these extracted confessions, and the state feared an international outcry.</p>\n\n<p>After the group had already spent more than two years in prison, the case was reopened. M.D. Riumin, the new head of the investigatory unit, was intent on showing that the defendants directed Jewish nationalist organizations that infiltrated the government at every level. After new interrogations, an indictment was drawn up, sent to Stalin and approved by the Politburo.</p>\n\n<p>A secret trial began in May 1952. Despite being physically broken, the defendants presented a powerful rebuttal. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"brandstaetter images/Hulton Archive/Imagno/Getty Images\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=822&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=822&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=822&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1034&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1034&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704416/original/file-20251125-74-n3wwsq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1034&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Solomon Lozovskii, pictured here in the 1930s, had led the Red International of Labor Unions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-chairman-of-the-red-international-of-labour-unions-news-photo/551907579\">brandstaetter images/Hulton Archive/Imagno/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Solomon Lozovskii, an old revolutionary and former deputy foreign minister, <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300104523/stalins-secret-pogrom/\">shredded the state’s accusations</a>.

Even the chairman of the court began to doubt the charges.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the defendants were convicted. Thirteen of the 15 were executed on Aug. 12, 1952.

The government identified advocacy solely on behalf of Jews, either at home or abroad, as \"bourgeois nationalism” or Zionism.</p>\n\n<p>Amid the intensifying Cold War, the government sought to mobilize popular support by resurrecting Russian nationalism, once an anathema to socialist revolutionaries. It reestablished many czarist discriminatory policies, <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/735359\">creating obstacles to Jewish advancement and education</a>.

He never succeeded, however, in staging a public trial or launching a wider hunt for enemies throughout the government.</p>\n\n<p>The courage of the defendants thwarted Riumin’s venomous ambition. They testified bravely about their abuse and exposed the falsity of the charges. Revolutionaries committed to the struggle against fascism, they held firm to the end.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265562/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have in the past received funding from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, the National Council for Eurasian and East European Research, the ACLS, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Doctors diagnosed me with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24211-placenta-previa\">complete placenta previa</a>. Then, while on bed rest at 32 weeks, my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5546/aap.2018.eng.e575\">placenta suddenly ruptured</a>, leading to an immediate emergency cesarean section. </p>\n\n<p>I became one of about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(23)00878-4\">10% of women giving birth in Nigeria</a> to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240073890\">experience a preterm birth</a>, which means before 37 weeks of pregnancy.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, as a maternal and child health researcher in the U.S., I’m struck by the stubbornly high preterm birth rate here. According to the most recent March of Dimes Report Card on maternal and infant health, released on Nov. 17, 2025, 10.4% of babies in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/25-MOD-RC-PolicyActions-Full-Booklet-r05.pdf\">were born prematurely in 2024</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Preterm birth is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/infant-mortality/index.html\">second-leading cause of infant deaths in the U.S.</a>, contributing to over <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/MarchofDimesReportCard-UnitedStates-2025.pdf\">20,000 infant deaths</a> each year. Some who survive are at increased <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina60061014\">risk of immediate and long-term health problems</a>, with substantial emotional and financial tolls. </p>\n\n<p>That rate has not budged for three years, according to the report – and it is consistently higher than in many other countries, particularly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(23)00878-4\">those in the Global North</a>. That’s also true for other crucial aspects of maternal and infant health, such as <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/aug/health-care-women-how-us-compares-internationally\">cardiovascular diseases and mental health needs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>One key factor underlying the problem of preterm birth in the U.S. is extensive disparities in health care access for expectant mothers. In Texas, where I conduct my research and where I managed the state’s <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/legislative/2024-Reports/MMMRC-DSHS-Joint-Biennial-Report-2024.pdf\">maternal mortality and morbidity review committee</a> in 2023 and 2024, this <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/center-health-statistics/texas-primary-care-office-tpco\">issue plays out very clearly</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Revealing disparities that drive preterm birth rates</h2>\n\n<p>The March of Dimes report scored the U.S. overall a D+ grade on preterm birth rate at 10.4%, but states differ dramatically in their scores. New Hampshire, for example, scored an A- with 7.9% of infants born prematurely, while Mississippi, where <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/report-card\">15% of infants are born prematurely</a>, scored an F.</p>\n\n<p>Texas’ rates aren’t the worst in the country, but it scores notably worse than the national rate of 10.4%, with 11.1% of babies – 43,344 in total – born prematurely in 2024. And Texas has an especially large effect on the low national score because 10 of the 46 cities that receive a D or F grade – defined in the report as a rate higher than the national rate of 10.4% – are located there. In 2023, Texas had the <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/MarchofDimesReportCard-UnitedStates.pdf\">highest number of such cities in the U.S</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That may be in part because access to maternal care in Texas is so limited. Close to half of all counties across the state completely lack <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/texas/maternity-care-deserts\">access to maternity care providers and birthing facilities</a>, compared with one-third of counties across the U.S. Moreover, more counties in Texas are designated as <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/workforce-shortage-areas/shortage-designation\">health professional shortage areas</a>, meaning they lack enough doctors for the number of people living in these areas. Shortages exist in 257 areas in Texas <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/center-health-statistics/texas-primary-care-office-tpco\">for primary care doctors</a>, 149 for dentists and 251 for mental health providers.</p>\n\n<p>But even against the backdrop of geographic differences in health care access, the starkest contribution to the state’s preterm birth rates comes from ethnic and racial disparities. Mothers of non-Hispanic Black (14.7%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (12.5%), Pacific Islander (12.3%) and Hispanic (10.1%) descent have babies prematurely much more often than do mothers who are non-Hispanic white (9.5%) or Asian (9.1%). </p>\n\n<p>These numbers reflect the broader landscape of maternal health in the U.S. Although nationwide maternal mortality rates decreased from 22.3 to 18.6 deaths per 100,000 live births from 2022 to 2023, Black women <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2023/maternal-mortality-rates-2023.htm\">died during pregnancy or within one year after childbirth</a> at almost three times the rate (50.3%) of white (14.5%), Hispanic (12.4%) and Asian (10.7%) women. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Newborn baby hand holding onto an adult finger.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704379/original/file-20251124-66-m7r0so.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Adequate prenatal birth care in the U.S. is critical to reversing preterm birth trends.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/new-born-baby-hand-hold-mum-index-finger-concept-royalty-free-image/1481408441\">Ratchat/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Preterm birth in context</h2>\n\n<p>Having a baby early is not the normal or expected outcome during pregnancy. It occurs due to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semperi.2017.07.009\">complex genetic and environmental factors</a>, which are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(23)00878-4\">exacerbated by inadequate prenatal care</a>. According to the World Health Organization, women should have <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549912\">eight or more doctor visits</a> during their pregnancy. Without adequate and quality prenatal care, the chances of reversing the preterm birth trends are slim.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in Texas, unequal access to prenatal care remains a huge cause for concern. As the March of Dimes report documents, women of color in Texas receive <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/report-card\">adequate prenatal care at vastly lower rates</a> than do white women – a fact that holds true in several other states as well. In addition, Texas has the <a href=\"https://everytexan.org/2022/12/14/data-brief-maternal-health-in-texas/\">highest uninsured rate in the nation</a>, with 17% of women uninsured for health coverage, compared with a national average of 8%.</p>\n\n<p>Nationwide, public health experts, community advocates and families are calling for comprehensive health insurance to help cover the costs of prenatal care, particularly for low-income families that primarily <a href=\"https://govfacts.org/government/federal/agencies/hhs/cms/medicaid-coverage-during-pregnancy-benefits-for-mothers-and-babies/\">rely on Medicaid</a> for childbirth. Cuts to funding for the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1\">2025 Budget Reconciliation Act</a> make it likely that more <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5614949/aca-subsidies-health-insurance-costs\">Americans will lose access to care</a> or see their health care costs balloon. </p>\n\n<p>But state-level action may help reduce access barriers. In Texas, for example, a set of <a href=\"https://txchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Legislative-Session-Final-Report-2025_HealthyFamilies.pdf\">laws passed in 2025 may help</a> improve access to care before, during and after pregnancy. Texas legislators funded initiatives targeted at workforce development in rural areas – particularly for obstetrician-gynecologists, emergency physicians and nurses, women’s preventive safety net programs, and maternal safety and quality improvement initiatives. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.015\">Rising rates of chronic diseases</a>, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, also contribute to <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/report-card\">women giving birth prematurely</a>. While working with the state maternal mortality and morbidity review committee, my team and I found that cardiovascular conditions contributed to the <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/legislative/2024-Reports/MMMRC-DSHS-Joint-Biennial-Report-2024.pdf\">85 pregnancy-related deaths that occurred in 2020</a>. </p>\n\n<p>An upward trend in <a href=\"https://healthdata.dshs.texas.gov/dashboard/maternal-and-child-health/maternal-health/maternal-health\">obesity, diabetes and hypertension</a> before pregnancy are pressing issues in the state, posing a serious threat to fetal and maternal health.</p>\n\n<h2>Learning from other countries</h2>\n\n<p>These statistics are grim.</p>\n\n<p>But proven strategies to reduce these and other causes of maternal mortality and morbidity are available. In Australia, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/woman-centred-care-strategic-directions-for-australian-maternity-services?language=en\">maternal deaths have significantly declined</a> from 12.7 per 100,000 live births in the early 1970s to <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/maternal-deaths-australia\">5.3 per 100,000 between 2021 and 2022</a>. The reduction can be linked to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.70011\">several medical interventions</a> that are based on equitable, safe, woman-centered and <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/woman-centred-care-strategic-directions-for-australian-maternity-services?language=en\">evidence-based maternal health services</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In Texas, some of my colleagues at Texas A&amp;M University use an <a href=\"https://www.britishjournalofmidwifery.com/content/birthwrite/woman-centred-care\">equitable, woman-centered approach</a> to develop <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.focus.20190041\">culturally competent care</a> centered on educational health promotion, <a href=\"https://nursing.tamu.edu/research/cpp/poemcf/index.html\">preventive health care and community services</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Utilizing nurses and nonmedical support roles such as community health workers and <a href=\"https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/labor-and-birth/having-a-doula/\">doulas</a>, my colleagues’ <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/maps-and-interactives/state-policies-improve-perinatal-health-outcomes\">initiatives complement existing state efforts</a> and close critical gaps in <a href=\"https://nursing.tamu.edu/research/cpp/poemcf/index.html\">health care access for rural and low-income Texas families</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Across the country, researchers are <a href=\"https://blackmaternalhealth.tufts.edu/\">using similar models</a>, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2016.03.150300\">the use of doulas</a>, to address the Black maternal health crisis.   </p>\n\n<p>Research shows the use of doulas can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2016.03.150300\">improve access to care during pregnancy and childbirth</a>, particularly for women of color.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Pregnant woman in a home having a massage from a non-medical caregiver.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704726/original/file-20251126-56-vqoqgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Doulas, nonmedical providers who may assist parents before, during and after delivery, can play an important role in improving maternal health outcomes.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pregnant-woman-having-a-massage-from-african-female-royalty-free-image/1384681282?phrase=doulas&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">AndreyPopov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>It’s all hands on deck</h2>\n\n<p>There isn’t one, single risk factor that leads to a preterm birth, nor is there a universal approach to its prevention. </p>\n\n<p>Results from my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2023.2259642\">work with Black mothers who had a preterm birth</a> aligns with what other experts are saying: Addressing the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.686807\">maternal health crisis in the U.S.</a> requires <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3226/text\">more than policy interventions</a>.

But your <a href=\"https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s2/chapter06.html\">brain doesn’t actually feel pain</a>. So what is going on when it feels like your head is in a vise or about to explode?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pediatrics.pitt.edu/people/katherine-cobb-pitstick\">I am a child neurologist</a> – that is, a doctor who specializes in diseases of the brain in kids. Most of my patients are kids and adolescents who are struggling with headaches.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00034.2015\">Head pain</a> is complicated, and there is still a lot to learn about what causes it and how it can be treated. But researchers know there are a few key players that take part in generating pain. </p>\n\n<h2>What are headaches?</h2>\n\n<p>Nerves <a href=\"https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/introneuroscience1/chapter/pain/\">communicate information like pain</a> through electrical signals between the body and the brain. </p>\n\n<p>While the brain itself doesn’t have any nerve sensors to feel pain, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-823356-6.00001-9\">blood vessels in the head and structures</a> that protect and surround the brain do sense pain. When these tissues detect injury or damage, they release chemicals that trigger transmission of electrical signals through nerves to tell the brain the head is hurting.</p>\n\n<p>The brain will also use nerves to signal the body to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-024-01914-z\">respond to pain with symptoms</a> like feeling tired, teary eyes, runny nose, upset stomach and discomfort in bright or loud environments. It’s not clear <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00437.x\">why humans evolved to feel these symptoms</a>, but some scientists theorize that this can lead to healthier lifestyle choices to decrease the chance of future headache attacks.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcJEKTTEGnA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Weather changes are one of the most commonly reported migraine triggers.  Danielle Wilhour, a neurologist and headache specialist at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, explains why shifts in weather can bring on migraines — and what you can do to ease the pain.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What causes headaches?</h2>\n\n<p>Often, headaches are a sign that the body is under some kind of stress.

They feel like a pulsing and pounding pain in your head and come with other symptoms, including nausea or being sensitive to lights and sounds. During a migraine, it can be hard to do everyday activities because they can make the pain worse.

Combined with <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/taxes/learn/new-york-state-tax\">the state income tax</a>, which is 10.9% for the top bracket, the increase would cement the city’s position as having the highest taxes on top earners in the country.</p>\n\n<p>It set off <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/rich-leave-new-york-city-after-mamdani-takes/story?id=127503351\">a chorus</a> <a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/2025/11/04/billionaires-brace-for-likely-mamdani-win\">of warnings</a> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/11/06/dave-portnoy-zohran-mamdani-barstool-new-york-move/87132339007/\">about the tax flight</a> of the city’s wealthiest residents.</p>\n\n<p>Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman claimed that both the city’s businesses <a href=\"https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1938094628034506984\">and wealthy residents</a> “have already started making arrangements for the exits.”</p>\n\n<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://x.com/DelgadoforNY/status/1990834035804025116\">echoed the concern</a>, opposing the proposal “because we cannot have them leave the state.” Before the election, Mamdani’s opponent, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuomo-jokes-even-i-move-florida-mamdani-wins-nyc-mayoral-bid\">joked that if Mamdani won</a>, “even I will move to Florida.”</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1985325081854189581&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yqMR-J4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I research whether high earners actually move when their taxes go up</a>. My colleagues and I have analyzed millionaire taxes in New Jersey and California, the migration of Forbes billionaires globally and decades of IRS data tracing where Americans with million-dollar incomes live.</p>\n\n<p>Top earners are often thought of as “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c1de9e8-a216-4679-9c66-a9a2126faf3b\">mobile millionaires</a>” who are ever searching for lower-tax places to live. In reality, they’re often reluctant to leave the places where they built their careers and raised their families. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, there are grains of truth in the tax migration arguments, so it’s important to carefully parse the evidence.</p>\n\n<h2>A small fraction of a small fraction</h2>\n\n<p>The first fact is simple: Millionaires have low migration rates. </p>\n\n<p>Mobility in America is highest among people who are still searching for their economic place in life. Workers who earn the lowest wages move across state lines at relatively high rates, about 4.5% per year, often in search of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Geography-Jobs-Enrico-Moretti/dp/0544028058\">more affordable housing</a>. <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/myth-millionaire-tax-flight\">People making $1 million-plus a year move only half as often</a>: Just 2.4% of them pack up each year.</p>\n\n<p>When millionaires do move, it rarely appears to be for tax reasons. For example, <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/top-5-states-new-york-residents-moved-2023-19846015.php\">Florida is the top destination</a> for New York movers in general. But among the richest 1% of New Yorkers, the top destination is <a href=\"https://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FPI-Migration-Pt-2.pdf\">Connecticut, followed by New Jersey and California</a>, all three of which levy a millionaire tax. </p>\n\n<p>Some millionaires certainly do favor lower-tax destinations. But many moves to low-tax states are offset by moves in the opposite direction to higher-tax states, and many other moves take place between states that have the same tax rate. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, only about 15% of millionaires who move end up with a lower tax bill. That shows the rich are willing and able to move for tax reasons. But because only about 2.4% of millionaires move each year – and only a fraction of those moves reduce their taxes – overall tax migration ends up being a small fraction of a small fraction. Not never, but not often. </p>\n\n<h2>Some benefits don’t have a dollar sign</h2>\n\n<p>Migration is mostly a young person’s game. </p>\n\n<p>The most mobile Americans are recent college graduates who are brimming with potential, searching for work and unburdened by major responsibilities. <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/myth-millionaire-tax-flight\">Their rate of migration from one state to another is over 12%</a>, more than four times the rate of millionaires.</p>\n\n<p>The typical adult mover <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/myth-millionaire-tax-flight\">is about 30 years old</a>, while the highest income earners are typically about 50. People choose where to build their careers and families decades before they reach their peak earnings phase.</p>\n\n<p>By the time someone earns enough to be taxed in the highest brackets, they’re usually late into their careers. They are almost always married, often have children at home, own their homes and, in many cases, own a business. Their social lives and their economic success are linked to local networks of colleagues, clients and connections built up over a long career. Moving away from those networks means giving up a great deal of social capital and starting over somewhere new.</p>\n\n<p>Top earners know that some states have lower taxes, but for most, tax flight is simply a bad deal. The social and economic costs of uprooting are bigger than the tax savings.</p>\n\n<h2>When your social world collapses</h2>\n\n<p>Two recent events showed why the rich generally stay where they are – and what it takes to move them.  </p>\n\n<p>The first was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which President Donald Trump signed into law in late 2017. The tax reform package capped the federal deduction for state and local taxes and raised taxes on high earners in states like New York, New Jersey and California. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-long-california-sayonara-new-york-1524611900\">So Long, California. Sayonara, New York</a>,” economists Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore predicted that 800,000 people a year would flee those states.</p>\n\n<p>They didn’t. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737165\">A colleague and I studied every millionaire tax return</a> in the country for two years before and after the reform. Nothing happened. There was no increase in migration out of the states where tax burdens rose. The predicted exodus simply did not occur.</p>\n\n<p>We were about to wrap up the study and call it case closed. Then something unexpected did happen: In early 2020, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737165\">millionaires began leaving high-tax states in large numbers</a>. Low-tax states saw no comparable outflows. The pattern matched those tax-flight predictions from just a few years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>It was the COVID-19 pandemic, and it brought a profound shock to the social lives of city residents. </p>\n\n<p>Offices emptied out, with entry swipes in major cities <a href=\"https://www.kastle.com/safety-wellness/getting-america-back-to-work/\">dropping by nearly 90%</a>. Time spent at work fell sharply, local amenities were shuttered, and time spent alone grew as in-person contact became a health risk. K–12 schools closed, disrupting children’s relationships with teachers and classmates. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A normally busy city street featuring just a couple of pedestrians.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704878/original/file-20251126-76-vd4dq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The COVID-19 pandemic briefly turned downtowns into ghost towns.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/people-walk-through-manhattan-as-office-buildings-which-news-photo/1305380560?adppopup=true\">Spencer Platt/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For many households, this was also a strange form of freedom, and a chance to rethink the geography of work and life, especially for top earners who could work remotely from anywhere. Disconnected from the bonds of place, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737165\">top earners moved and clearly favored low-tax destinations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson is that social lives and economic policies are deeply intertwined. The 2017 tax reform had no effect on migration because the social cost of moving is high – especially for people at the peak of their careers who are enjoying the many social benefits of economic success. As long as those connections to others are strong, they outweigh the appeal of moving to lower-tax states. </p>\n\n<p>When the pandemic broke apart so much of social life, the ledger shifted. If your office, school, friendships and daily routines no longer anchor you in place, what is keeping you in a high-tax place?</p>\n\n<p>But by early 2023, as social and economic life returned to normal, we found that millionaire migration patterns mostly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737165\">reverted to their prepandemic baselines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the surge in tax flight was temporary.</p>\n\n<h2>If you want the rich, appeal to the young</h2>\n\n<p>There is a big lesson here for state and city policies. </p>\n\n<p>Every place wants to attract high-income earners and the spending power and tax dollars that accompany their salaries. Many policymakers think that tax cuts will lure them in, but this is mostly a fool’s errand. In normal times, the rich are deeply rooted and not movable. </p>\n\n<p>The real opportunity lies in attracting and retaining the next generation of top earners – young people who are unattached to place and looking for opportunities to build their careers and their lives. Places that draw young professionals build the pipeline of future top earners.</p>\n\n<p>Those early-career folks are mobile, but they are not thinking about the top tax rate. Their salaries are low. They are trying to find good jobs, pay the rent, form relationships and start families. They hope to be successful enough to one day be paying Mamdani’s millionaire tax. For the time being, though, they need the basic costs of living to be manageable. Soon they will need affordable child care and good public schools for their kids. </p>\n\n<p>If the city helps them that far along, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/business/jamie-dimon-backs-buffett-rule-to-raise-taxes-on-millionaires\">many of them</a> would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html\">gladly pay a millionaire tax</a>  when and if <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/commentary-we-re-millionaires-it-s-time-20226505.php\">the time comes</a>.

Article I – the first one, after all – <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/\">details the awesome responsibilities of the House of Representatives and the Senate</a>: power to levy taxes, fund the government, declare war, impeach justices and presidents, and approve treaties, among many, many others. </p>\n\n<p>In comparison, <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/\">Article II</a>, detailing the responsibilities of the president, and <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-3/\">Article III</a>, detailing the Supreme Court, are rather brief – further deferring to the preferred branch, Congress, for actual policymaking.</p>\n\n<p>At the helm of this new legislative centerpiece, there was only one leadership requirement: The House of Representatives <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/#article-1-section-2-clause-5\">must select</a> a speaker of the House. </p>\n\n<p>The position, modeled after parliamentary leaders in the British House of Commons, was <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Records-and-Research/Speakers-Resources/Speaker-Resources/\">meant to act</a> as a nonpartisan moderator and referee. <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf\">The framers famously disliked political parties</a>, and they knew the importance of building coalitions to solve the young nation’s vast policy problems.</p>\n\n<p>But this idealistic vision for leadership quickly dissolved. </p>\n\n<p>The current <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/mike-johnson/J000299\">speaker of the House, Mike Johnson</a>, a Republican from Louisiana, holds a position that has strayed dramatically from this nonpartisan vision. Today, the leadership role is far more than legislative manager – it is a powerful, party-centric position that controls nearly every aspect of House activity. </p>\n\n<p>And while most speakers have used their tenure to strengthen the position and the power of Congress as a whole, Johnson’s choice to <a href=\"https://time.com/magazine/us/7308151/august-7th-2025-vol-206-no-5/\">lead by following President Donald Trump</a> drifts the position even further from the framers’ vision of congressional primacy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large room with many people sitting in semicircular rows.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704628/original/file-20251125-56-xrkcep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=604&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The opening of the second session of the 59th Congress in 1906, with Speaker Joseph Cannon presiding.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-house-called-to-order-opening-of-59th-congress-1906-news-photo/1425881942?adppopup=true\">Artist Frances Benjamin Johnston, Photo by Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Centralizing power</h2>\n\n<p>By the early 1800s, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, first elected speaker in 1810 as a member of the Whig Party, used the position to <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/president/adams/essays/clay-1825-secretary-of-state\">pursue personal policy goals</a>, most notably entry into the War of 1812 against Great Britain.</p>\n\n<p>Speaker Thomas Reed continued this trend by <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/R/REED,-Thomas-Brackett-%28R000128%29/\">enacting powerful procedures</a> in 1890 that allowed his Republican majority party to steamroll opposition in the legislative process. </p>\n\n<p>In 1899, Speaker David Henderson <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/14874?ret=True\">created a Republican “cabinet”</a> of new chamber positions that directly answered to – and owed their newly elevated positions to – him.</p>\n\n<p>In the 20th century, in an attempt to further control the legislation Congress considered, reformers solidified the speaker’s power over procedure and party. <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/10600\">Speaker Joseph Cannon</a>, a Republican who ascended to the position in 1903, <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Blog/2023/April/4-12-Cannon-Bluff/\">commandeered the powerful Rules Committee</a>, which allowed speakers to control not only which legislation received a vote but even the amending and voting process. </p>\n\n<p>At the other end of the 20th century was an effort to retool the position into a fully partisan role. After being elected speaker in 1995, Republican Newt Gingrich expanded the responsibilities of the office beyond handling legislation by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv2s5b4ct\">centralizing resources in the office of the speaker</a>. Gingrich grew the size of leadership staff – and prevented policy caucuses from hiring their own. He controlled the flow of information from committee chairs to rank-and-file members, and <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/magazine/2020/fall/arts-and-culture/gingrich.html\">even directed</a> access to congressional activity by C-SPAN, the public service broadcaster that provides coverage of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the modern speaker of the House now plays a powerful role in the development and passage of legislation – a dynamic that scholars refer to as the <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/unorthodox-lawmaking/book243858\">“centralization” of Congress</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Part of this is out of necessity: <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/the-house-explained\">The House in particular, with 435 members</a>, requires someone to, well, lead. And as America has grown in population, economic power and the size of government, the policy problems Congress tackles have become more complex, making this job all the more important. </p>\n\n<p>But the position that began as coalition-building has evolved into controlling the floor schedule and <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo20832419.html\">flow of information</a> and coordinating and commandeering committee work. <a href=\"https://batten.virginia.edu/people/sorelle-wyckoff-gaynor\">My work on Congress</a> has also documented how leaders invoke their power to dictate <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lsq.12479\">constituent communication</a> for members of their party and use <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lsq.12360\">campaign finance donations</a> to bolster party loyalty.</p>\n\n<p>This centralization has cemented the responsibilities of the speaker within the chamber. More importantly, it has elevated the speaker to a national party figure. </p>\n\n<h2>Major legislation passed</h2>\n\n<p>Some successful leaders have been able to translate these advantages to pass major party priorities: Speaker Sam Rayburn, a Democrat from Texas, began his tenure in 1940 and was the <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/20184\">longest-serving speaker of the House</a>, ultimately working with eight different presidents. </p>\n\n<p>Under Rayburn’s leadership, Congress passed incredible projects, including the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/marshall-plan\">Marshall Plan</a> to fund recovery and reconstruction in postwar Western Europe, and legislation to develop and construct the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/june-26/congress-approves-federal-highway-act\">Interstate Highway System</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the modern era, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and the <a href=\"https://pelosi.house.gov/biography\">first and only female speaker</a>, began her tenure in 2007 and held together a diverse Democratic coalition to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4337/9781035328918\">pass the Affordable Care Act into law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But as the role of speaker has become one of proactive party leader, rather than passive chamber manager, not all speakers have been able to keep their party happy. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two men at a desk, speaking, with an American flag hung behind them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=591&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=591&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704632/original/file-20251125-56-blx40z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=591&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Republican Minority Leader Joseph William Martin Jr., left, and Democratic Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn confer on the House rostrum in January 1956.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/on-the-rostrum-at-the-house-of-representatives-the-leaders-news-photo/642536820?adppopup=true\">PhotoQuest/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Protecting Congress’ power</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9538\">John Boehner, a Republican who became speaker in 2011</a>, was known for his procedural expertise and diplomatic skills. But he ultimately resigned after he relied on a bipartisan coalition to end a government shutdown in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/us/politics/with-debt-ceiling-vote-boehner-blunts-gop-infighting.html\">avert financial crises</a>, causing his support among his party to plummet. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/kevin-mccarthy-ousted-as-house-speaker-in-dramatic-vote\">Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in 2023</a> from the position by his own Republican Party after working with Democratic members to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-approves-stopgap-government-funding-bill-hours-before-shutdown-deadline\">fund the government</a> and maintain Congress’ power of the purse.</p>\n\n<p>Although these decisions angered the party, they symbolized the enduring nature of the position’s intention: the protector of Article I powers. Speakers have used their growing array of policy acumen, procedural advantages and congressional resources to navigate the chamber through immense policy challenges, reinforcing Article I responsibilities – from levying taxes to reforming major programs that affect every American – that other branches simply could not ignore. </p>\n\n<p>In short, a strengthened party leader has often strengthened Congress as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Although Johnson, the current speaker, inherited one of the most well-resourced speaker offices in U.S. history, he faces a dilemma in his position: solving enormous national policy challenges while managing an unruly party bound by loyalty to a leader outside of the chamber. </p>\n\n<p>Johnson’s recent decision to keep Congress <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-house-returns-mike-johnson/\">out of session</a> for eight weeks during the entirety of the government shutdown indicates a balance of deference tilted toward party over the responsibilities of a powerful Congress. </p>\n\n<p>This eight-week absence severely weakened the chamber. Not being in session meant no committee meetings, and thus, no oversight; no appropriations bills passed, and thus, more deference to executive-branch funding decisions; and no policy debates or formal declarations of war, and thus, domestic and foreign policy alike being determined by unelected bureaucrats and appointed judges. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for frustrated House members and their constituents, beyond new leadership, there is little recourse. </p>\n\n<p>While the gradual, powerful concentration of authority has made the speaker’s office more responsive to party and national demands alike, it has also left the chamber dependent on the speaker to safeguard the power of the People’s House.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270440/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>SoRelle Wyckoff Gaynor does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

When Vistra announced it was converting the site into the world’s largest lithium-ion battery facility, the plan was hailed as a <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise\">clean energy milestone</a>. Phase 1 alone housed batteries with 300 megawatts of capacity, enough to power about 225,000 homes for four hours.</p>\n\n<p>The energy in rechargeable batteries comes from the flow of electrons released by lithium atoms in the anode moving toward the cathode. </p>\n\n<p>In the type of batteries at the Moss Landing facility, the cathode was rich in three metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. These batteries are prized for their high energy density and relatively low cost, but they are also prone to <a href=\"https://ul.org/research-updates/what-is-thermal-runaway/\">thermal runaway</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lab experiments have shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02786826.2021.1938966\">burning batteries can eject metal particles</a> like confetti.</p>\n\n<h2>Metals found in wetlands matched batteries</h2>\n\n<p>When my team and I returned to the marsh three days after the fire, ash and burned debris covered the ground. Weeks afterward, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-25972-8\">charred fragments still clung to the vegetation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our measurements with portable X-ray fluorescence <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/heavy-metals-found-in-monterey-estuary-after-moss-landing-lithium-battery-fire\">showed sharp increases in nickel, manganese and cobalt</a> compared with data from before the fire. As soon as we saw the numbers, we alerted officials in four counties about the risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We estimate that about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-25972-8\">25 metric tons</a> (55,000 pounds) of heavy metals were deposited across roughly half a square mile (1.2 square kilometers) of wetland around <a href=\"https://elkhornslough.org/\">Elkorn Slough</a>, and that was only part of the area that saw fallout.</p>\n\n<p>To put this in perspective, the part of the Vistra battery facility that burned was hosting 300 megawatts of batteries, which equates to roughly 1,900 metric tons of cathode material. Estimates of the amount of batteries that burned range <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ca/moss-landing-vistra-battery-fire\">from 55%</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/moss-landing-fire-20042587.php\">80%</a>. Based on those estimates, roughly 1,000 to 1,400 metric tons of cathode material could have been carried into the smoke plume. What we found in the marsh represents about 2% of what may have been released.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three series of maps of the area showing change in quantities of the three metals.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=630&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=630&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=630&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=791&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=791&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700061/original/file-20251103-61-b696yq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=791&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">These contour maps show how metals from the Moss Landing battery fire settled across nearby wetlands.

At Moss Landing, some of the government’s sampling <a href=\"https://www.readymontereycounty.org/emergency/2025-moss-landing-vistra-power-plant-fire/testing\">turned up low concentrations</a> of the metals, likely because the samples came from broad, mixed layers that diluted the concentration of metals rather than the thin surface deposits where contaminants settled. </p>\n\n<h2>Continuing risks to marine life</h2>\n\n<p>Metals from the Moss Landing battery fire still linger in the region’s sediments and food webs.</p>\n\n<p>These metals bioaccumulate, building up through the food chain: The metals in marsh soils can be taken up by worms and small invertebrates, which are eaten by fish, crabs or shorebirds, and eventually by top predators such as sea otters or harbor seals.</p>\n\n<p>Our research group is now <a href=\"https://elkhornslough.org/moss-landing-battery-fire/\">tracking the bioaccumulation</a> in Elkhorn Slough’s shellfish, crabs and fish.

A prayer by the Persian King Darius the Great that was carved in stone more than 2,000 years ago asked his god to <a href=\"https://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dpd/\">protect the land from invaders, famine and lies</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, today, Iran’s escalating water and environmental problems are the predictable outcome of decades of treating the region’s finite water resources as if they were limitless. </p>\n\n<p>Iran has relied heavily on water-intensive irrigation to grow food in dry landscapes and subsidized water and energy use, resulting in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024221118\">overpumping from aquifers and falling groundwater supplies</a>. The concentration of economic activity and employment in major urban centers, particularly Tehran, has also catalyzed massive migration, further straining already overstretched water resources. </p>\n\n<p>Those and other forces have driven Iran toward “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00210862.2016.1259286\">water bankruptcy</a>” – the point where water demand permanently exceeds the supply and nature can’t keep up.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Four people walk next to a bridge across dry ground where a river normally runs.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704882/original/file-20251126-56-ijp2rq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=521&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People walk across the dried-up Zayandeh Rud riverbed in the historic city of Isfahan, Iran, in February 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/iranian-people-walk-along-a-dried-up-zayandeh-rud-riverbed-news-photo/2201332786?adppopup=true\">Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Iran’s centralized, top-down approach to water governance has <a href=\"https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/dec/05/explainer-irans-water-bankruptcy\">proven ineffective in ensuring the sustainability of its water</a> resources and in maintaining a balance between renewable water supply and demand, a gap that has continued to widen.</p>\n\n<p>Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has pursued an <a href=\"https://www.kavehmadani.com/_files/ugd/34bbdd_cbb82445d41e488ca15cf86ef57cf90d.pdf?index=true\">aggressive hydraulic mission</a>, building dams and diverting rivers to support sprawling cities and expanding irrigated agriculture.

The timing of the development and Embaló’s connection to the new government figures have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/27/world/africa/guinea-bissau-coup.html\">led domestic opposition groups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nlxlr87go\">some West African political leaders</a> to claim the coup was staged to facilitate Embaló’s continued rule by proxy.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the veracity of such claims, the events point to both a deepening regional crisis of democracy and the inability of Guinea-Bissau to escape its coup-prone history. Indeed, as a <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/about-us/people/faculty/john-chin.html\">scholar who has compiled and updated</a> a <a href=\"https://www.johnjchin.com/colpus\">dataset of coup types</a> and documented their <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/historical-dictionary-of-modern-coups-d%C3%A9tat-9798216310266/\">history in Guinea-Bissau</a> since its independence from Portugal in 1974, I believe the country is caught in a classic <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/poverty-the-coup-trap-and-the-seizure-of-executive-power/2D6EC35637250DDD2C5B9F9489A823D8\">coup trap</a> whereby poverty and coups d’etat are mutually reinforcing. </p>\n\n<h2>The Sahel coup belt keeps expanding</h2>\n\n<p>The events in Guinea-Bissau reflect a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/an-epidemic-coups-un-chief-laments-urging-security-council-act-2021-10-26/\">so-called polycrisis for countries in and around the Sahel belt</a>, sandwiched between North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. This region has, since 2020, become the <a href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-may-1/\">global epicenter of both terrorism</a> and coups – so much so that it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2025.2508086\">sometimes dubbed the Sahel “coup belt”</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The events in Guinea-Bissau, which is located just south of the Sahel region, represent the 11th successful coup in Africa since 2020 – and the second successful one in 2025 after the military <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/madagascars-military-power-grab-shows-africas-coup-problem-isnt-restricted-to-the-sahel-region-267581\">takeover in Madagascar</a> in October following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/gen-z-victory-young-protesters-toppled-madagascar-leader\">wave of Gen Z protests</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, nearly three-quarters of all coup attempts in the world since 2020 have taken place in West Africa or the Sahel. The region accounts for an even higher share of successful coups since 2020. This unprecedented cluster of coups comes in a region that accounts for <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/sahel-countries\">less than 10% of both Africa’s population </a> and the number of states in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The Sahel region is responsible for around 75% of recent coups</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/705419/original/file-20251130-66-j2fftq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Graph created from the Colpus Dataset.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.johnjchin.com/colpus\">John Joseph Chin</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There have been many reasons <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2023.1077945/full\">for the various coups in the Sahel since 2020</a>. Takeovers in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, for example, were driven in part by <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/region/conflict-sahel\">growing terrorist insurgencies</a>, <a href=\"https://africacenter.org/spotlight/mapping-a-surge-of-disinformation-in-africa/\">Russian disinformation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clingendael.org/publication/twilight-french-influence-sahel\">rising anti-French sentiment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/conflict-data\">data from the conflict monitoring organization Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, or ACLED</a>, shows very little conflict or protest in Guinea-Bissau leading up to the coup. Instead, events appear to lie in political opportunism in the wake of an election marred by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/guinea-bissaus-presidential-poll-has-already-failed-the-credibility-test-269461\">flaws and allegations of illegitimacy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Guinea-Bissau’s ‘coup trap’</h2>\n\n<p>Before the latest military takeover, Guinea-Bissau was already the fourth-most coup-prone state in sub-Saharan Africa, having <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-bissaus-history-coups-instability-2025-11-27/\">suffered five failed coup attempts and three successful ones</a> since 1974. Coups toppled the single-party regime of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in 1980, the authoritarian regime of Kumba Yala in 2003 and overthrew democracy and installed an indirect military regime in 2012. Meanwhile, a failed coup attempt in 1998 sparked the <a href=\"https://www.peaceagreements.org/conflict/86/\">country’s only civil war</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2020, Guinea-Bissau had suffered one bona fide <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2023.1077945/full\">coup attempt, in February 2022</a>, in addition to a mutiny in late 2022 that Embaló condemned as a coup attempt. The coup of November 2025 was itself foreshadowed by an alleged coup plot that was revealed at the end of October, when a number of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/senior-officers-arrested-guinea-bissau-alleged-coup-attempt-2025-10-31/\">senior officers were arrested</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of that suggests a feature of this type of instability: Coups beget more coups. In fact, seven of the nine nations that have suffered successful coups since 2020 had already suffered a successful coup within the previous 20 years. </p>\n\n<p>And whereas nearly 30% of nations with coups since 2005 suffered a coup again between 2020 and 2025, states that lacked a recent coup history – even poor countries in Africa – were much less likely to suffer a coup after 2020.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vFnfA\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vFnfA/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Coup as a feature, not a bug</h2>\n\n<p>Following the 2022 coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau, Embaló had <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/rush-to-personalize-power-concentration-after-failed-coups-in-dictatorships/C0828C76D7C2EAE1EAC912F929E62EC3\">moved to consolidate</a> the government under his leadership and reduce constraints on the executive. Indeed, data on <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/66/3/sqac041/6650519\">three key dimensions of democracy</a> shows that electoral contestation, voter participation and executive constraints have all declined significantly in Guinea-Bissau since.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf\">Varieties of Democracy project</a>, which surveys experts to measure different levels of democracy, declared in 2022 that Guinea-Bissau had become an “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2025.2476183\">electoral autocracy</a>” – a term to denote governments that are elected through unfair and fraudulent means and go on to rule in an authoritarian manner.</p>\n\n<p>The nation has continued to <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00223433231168192\">slide into autocracy</a> since then. </p>\n\n<p>Embaló used an alleged coup plot in December 2023 as a pretext to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-bissaus-president-embalo-dissolves-parliament-citing-corruption-2022-05-16/\">dissolve the opposition-dominated legislature</a>. The country has not had a sitting legislature since. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier in 2025, Embaló <a href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2025/09/05/guinea-bissau-embalo-clings-to-presidency-despite-end-of-term//\">went back on his promise</a> to step down at the end of his first term and instead announced he was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-bissau-president-run-second-term-backtracking-vow-step-down-2025-03-04/\">running for a second term</a>. Given that Embaló had <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251123-guinea-bissau-heads-to-polls-as-president-embalo-seeks-second-term\">barred the main opposition</a> party from running, many feared he might try to steal the election, if necessary, much like <a href=\"https://theloop.ecpr.eu/re-electing-cameroons-forever-president/\">Paul Biya is alleged to have done in nearby Cameroon</a> in October 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>Not a ‘good coup,‘ but a ‘veto coup’</h2>\n\n<p>When asked about recent coups in Africa, Rwandan President <a href=\"https://en.igihe.com/spip.php?page=mv2_article&amp;id_article=56402\">Paul Kagame</a> insisted that some coups – those that oppose corruption and bad governance – are “good coups.” Though scholars have <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053168016630837\">debated how frequent</a> so-called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/fpa.12046\">good coups</a> have been in Africa, there is little doubt that the recent case better fits the classic pattern of a so-called “veto coup,” meant to prevent the winner of the election from taking office.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the presence of prominent Embaló allies in the interim Guinea-Bissau government lends credence to opposition cries of foul play. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/guinea-bissau-coup-west-africa-embalo-dias-e4f934094d4c96730473dd16bc8f0259\">new government’s promise</a> of democratic elections in a year should likewise be treated with skepticism. The promised electoral timetable has not been kept in any other recent coup case in the Sahel, where juntas remain entrenched.</p>\n\n<p>As such, even if Guinea-Bissau was becoming increasingly autocratic already, the latest takeover is likely a cure worse than the disease. Whether the international community that has condemned the coup – from the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166467\">United Nations</a> to the <a href=\"https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20251127/chairperson-unequivocally-condemns-military-coup-detat-guinea-bissau\">African Union</a> to the Economic Community of West African Nations – is willing or able to take credible steps to help guide Guinea-Bissau back to constitutional rule looks uncertain, given the recent example of other coup-hit nations across the continent.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270958/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John Joseph Chin does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The rationale is clear: The tiny, remote island in the Pacific features nearly 1,000 enormous statues – <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Statues-that-Walked/Terry-Hunt/9781439154342\">the moai</a>. The magnitude and number of these monuments defy easy explanation. </p>\n\n<p>Since European ships first encountered these stone giants in the 18th century, outsiders have branded the island as fundamentally mysterious, possibly beyond archaeologists’ ability to explain. This characteristic is part of what makes the island famous. Tour operators market the inexplicable. Documentaries promise unsolved puzzles. Popular books ask how “primitive people” <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/Aku-Aku-the-secret-of-Easter-Island/oclc/645749491\">could possibly move 70-ton megaliths</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Archaeological researchers have put forward various explanations for the statues, which were made between 1200 and 1700, but there remains no consensus. For decades, experts offered plausible scenarios: <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/29564864\">powerful chiefs</a> commanding workers, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/32163979\">elite-controlled</a> statue quarries, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/318941165\">wooden sleds</a> drawn by hundreds of islanders, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/346708\">roller systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eisp.org/category/archaeology/transport/\">wooden rails</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2011.579483\">ceremonial pathway markers</a>. Based on authoritative assertions and compelling narratives, these accounts are rarely connected to archaeological evidence.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=j9V8kzYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">an archaeologist</a> who has been studying Rapa Nui for more than two decades. In newly published research, my colleagues and I believe we’ve solved the mystery in three essential ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, using 11,686 photographs taken by drone, we created a comprehensive, <a href=\"https://arcg.is/qu59O1\">three-dimensional model of Rano Raraku</a>, the <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/32163979\">volcanic crater</a> where 95% of Rapa Nui’s moai were carved. It was a <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">systematic documentation</a> – every slope, every carved surface, every production feature captured at a resolution down to the centimeter. The model generated predictions that we and other researchers could test: If production had been centralized, workshops would have been clustered; if they’d been hierarchical, we’d find differences in resources used at each level; if it had been dictated by elites, techniques would be standardized.</p>\n\n<p>Our data <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">revealed the opposite</a>: Drone imagery shows 30 independent workshops working simultaneously. Instead of top-down organization, small, clan-level groups seem to have used innovative human engineering.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a stone hillside with multiple carvings with colored line annotations\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704862/original/file-20251126-66-sovfgd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A close-up of a 3D model of the volcanic crater where nearly all of Rapa Nui’s giant statues were carved, with unfinished carvings outlined.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">Lipo et al., 2025, PLOS One</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Previous attempts to understand Rano Raraku failed not because the quarry held impenetrable secrets but due to the lack of published documentation and the limitations of traditional mapping methods. <a href=\"https://www.bibliotecanacionaldigital.gob.cl/bnd/631/w3-article-651549.html\">Two-dimensional maps</a> couldn’t capture three-dimensional relationships. Statues emerge from cliff faces <a href=\"https://arcg.is/1f9Gf85\">at various angles</a>. Production areas <a href=\"https://arcg.is/WiWrm\">overlap vertically</a>. Carving sequences intersect across time.

We identified 426 moai in various stages of production, 341 extraction trenches, 133 voids where completed statues were removed, and previously unmapped quarrying areas on the exterior slopes. Each workshop was self-contained, demonstrating decentralization. Three distinct carving techniques emerge, showing that different groups employed different approaches while producing standardized forms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"figures carved into a rock formation\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704860/original/file-20251126-56-5egsym.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=368&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Unfinished moai remain partially carved in a volcanic crater.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">Lipo et al., 2025, PLOS One</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The walking moai</h2>\n\n<p>Second, we generated data to resolve the age-old question about moai transport: How did Rapanui people move these megalithic giants? Despite many decades of attempts, previous transport theories all shared a fatal flaw: They <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">made no predictions</a> that were testable, meaning that scientists could prove or disprove.</p>\n\n<p>Our walking hypothesis – based on oral traditions, ideas by our colleague <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sergio-Haoa\">Sergio Rapu Haoa</a> and tested by Czech engineer <a href=\"https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Pavel_Pavel\">Pavel Pavel</a> – made specific, testable predictions. We found that “road moai,” those statues that were abandoned along constructed roads used for transport, differ morphologically from those that reached their final destinations, large platforms called ahu. </p>\n\n<p>We measured 62 moai abandoned along ancient roads. The road moai proved distinct, characterized by wider bases, D-shaped cross sections and a forward lean of 5-15 degrees. These features wouldn’t be necessary if the moai were transported in a horizontal position. They <a href=\"https://plos.io/49gsOyE\">make vertical transport</a> – “walking” the statues – possible.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.09.029\">built a 4.35-ton concrete replica</a> scaled from road moai. It wasn’t an artistic interpretation but a precise reproduction of measurable features from a statue found along the road and abandoned during transport. With 18 people and three ropes, the statue walked 100 meters in 40 minutes. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHTkcbavhv0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In previous work, the author and colleagues built a replica moai to demonstrate the walking transport.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In recently published work, we documented that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">physics confirmed</a> what walking the replica demonstrated about the road moai shape. The forward lean creates an inverted pendulum that converts lateral oscillation into forward progress. </p>\n\n<p>Those moai that reached ahu must have been altered in order for them to stand upright stably, while those along the roads would retain the features that enabled them to be “walked.”</p>\n\n<p>The distribution data for moai across the landscape provided another test: The locations of road moai leading from the quarry follow an exponential decay curve, meaning that probability of a moai falling in transport is highest near the quarry and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">decreases with distance</a> since those that fall over never get any farther. Fracture patterns on those road moai with breaks align with vertical impact stresses, meaning the broken moai were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">damaged by falling from a standing position</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our testable predictions held. </p>\n\n<h2>Deforestation without collapse</h2>\n\n<p>The third “mystery” is how an advanced society could destroy its own environment. The island was <a href=\"https://www.americanscientist.org/article/rethinking-the-fall-of-easter-island\">deforested by the end of the 17th century</a>. This mystery also yielded to systematic analysis. We analyzed data from previous archaeological excavations. Rather than finding increased rat consumption by people, indicating dietary stress from a lack of other food sources, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">remains of rats eaten by people decreased over time</a> while seafood dominated throughout.</p>\n\n<p>Ecological modeling revealed what we think really happened. Polynesian rats, introduced with the arrival of the first Polynesian colonists around 1200, could grow into a population of millions within just a few years. By eating 95% of the island’s tree seeds, rats <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106383\">prevented forest regeneration</a>. Humans cleared land for cultivation, but rats made the recovery of the palm forests impossible. The synergistic interaction seems to have accelerated deforestation within five centuries.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t “ecocide” – intentional self-destruction – but rather unintended ecological transformation caused by an introduced species. Our research also demonstrated that the Rapanui adapted <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rocks-on-rapa-nui-tell-the-story-of-a-small-resilient-population-countering-the-notion-of-a-doomed-overpopulated-island-232935\">through the use of rock mulch agriculture</a>, which improved soil productivity. They continued to eat seafood and produce monuments for 500 years after deforestation began.</p>\n\n<p>To tackle Rapa Nui’s mysteries, we used systematic documentation. We specified testable predictions, gathered data that could prove us wrong and accepted what the evidence showed. Rapa Nui shows that even entrenched mysteries yield to methodical investigation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270023/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carl Lipo receives funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society.</span></em></p>",

Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-cuts-hit-struggling-food-banks-risking-hunger-low-income-americans-2025-03-25/\">temporary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-harmful-republican-megabill-takes-food-assistance-away-from\">permanent cuts to food assistance</a> programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. government estimates that <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics\">more than 47 million people</a> in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=58388\">hundreds of billions of dollars</a> a year on programs to help them.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-food/food-safety/food-loss-and-waste/food-waste-faqs\">as much as 40% of it</a> – rots before being eaten. That amount is <a href=\"https://refed.org/food-waste/the-problem/#overview\">equivalent to 120 billion meals a year</a>: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year. </p>\n\n<p>This colossal waste has <a href=\"https://divertinc.com/the-cost-of-wasted-food\">enormous economic costs</a> and renders useless all the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/land-research/farm-kitchen-environmental-impacts-us-food-waste\">water and resources used to grow the food</a>. In addition, as it rots, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data\">the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane</a> – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://wfpc.sanford.duke.edu/podcasts/is-todays-food-waste-a-consequence-of-historical-public-policy/\">scholar</a> of <a href=\"https://wastedfood.american.edu/research/why-is-food-wasted/\">wasted food</a>, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025.

Mass <a href=\"https://www.food-safety.com/articles/10878-federal-workforce-data-reveal-impact-of-trump-admin-rifs-on-usda-food-safety-expertise\">firings of food safety personnel</a> risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda\">tainted imports</a>, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/51381466/nearly-35000-turkeys-killed-off-at-central-utah-facility-as-bird-flu-returns\">nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/10/usda-cancels-local-food-purchasing-for-schools-food-banks-00222796\">helped schools and food banks buy food</a> from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were <a href=\"https://www.ourweekly.com/2025/11/19/facing-fire-and-funding-cuts/\">unable to count on a key revenue source</a> to keep their farms afloat.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/health/food-poisoning-hurricane-wellness\">food-storage refrigeration</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/nyregion/nyc-food-banks-cuts.html\">derailing communities’ ability</a> to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/social-policy/explainer-understanding-snap-program-and-what-cuts\">benefit substantially</a> from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer/training/notice/equal-treatment-rule\">SNAP customers must pay the same prices</a> as other customers.</p>\n\n<p>Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.</p>\n\n<p><em>American University School of International Service master’s student <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurel-levin-932316b5/\">Laurel Levin</a> contributed to the writing of this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270027/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Garrett Graddy-Lovelace received funding from the NSF Multiscale RECIPES for Sustainable Food Systems project.</span></em></p>",

And a flurry of reports from Israel suggest the Israeli military is getting ready to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/22/tense-calm-in-far-north-as-israel-prepares-to-finish-the-job-against-hezbollah\">finish the job</a>” against Hezbollah.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective as a <a href=\"https://kroc.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/asher-kaufman/\">historian focusing on Israeli-Lebanese relations</a>, the ceasefire and Israel’s emergence as the regional military hegemon has not translated into stability and constructive change in the Middle East, not even for Israel. In fact, the shaky agreement is a testament that without diplomacy and a long-term stabilizing accord, military power alone will not suffice.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s in a ceasefire</h2>\n\n<p>The ceasefire ostensibly brought an end to the latest war between Israel and Hezbollah. After entering the conflict that followed Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hezbollah saw its leadership and military capabilities debilitated by Israel, setting off a ripple effect that has helped reshape the Middle East. </p>\n\n<p>Just as an empowered Hezbollah managed for decades to <a href=\"https://newlinesinstitute.org/nonstate-actors/hezbollahs-ascendance-regional-influence-global-networks-and-implications-for-middle-east-stability/\">influence Middle East politics</a>, its sudden loss of strength had a similar effect in reverse – contributing to regime change in Syria and Israel’s war on Iran in June. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A protester holds a flag in front of burning tires.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704653/original/file-20251125-56-ageu68.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A retired member of the Lebanese security forces holds a national flag and flashes a victory sign next to burning tires blocking a road leading to the government palace during a protest in Beirut on Sept. 17, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Lebanon/8ac00bf87f7041d3ac4d7bf477157e53/photo\">AP Photo/Bilal Hussein</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The November 2024 <a href=\"https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1437074/full-text-of-the-cease-fire-agreement-between-lebanon-and-israel.html\">ceasefire agreement</a> stipulated that, along with the cessation of fighting, Lebanon would remove all nonstate military forces and assets, starting in the south, between the Litani River and the border with Israel. The Lebanese army and other state security branches would remain the sole armed forces in the country. </p>\n\n<p>In exchange, Israel was meant to gradually withdraw from the areas it occupied in southern Lebanon within 60 days. The agreement also stipulated that the United States would broker indirect negotiations between Israel and Lebanon to achieve an internationally recognized delineation of their land border.</p>\n\n<p>A year later, none of these objectives has been achieved. Israel continues to occupy <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-forces-remain-five-locations-southern-lebanon-removal-deadline-rcna192449\">five border posts</a> inside Lebanon and conducts daily raids into the country.

It was the <a href=\"https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Yusri-Hazran.pdf\">first Lebanese government since 2008</a> in which Hezbollah did not possess veto power over its actions. </p>\n\n<p>Many in Lebanon saw this as a <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/seizing-lebanons-moment-why-now\">once-in-a-generation opportunity</a> for the state to regain its sovereign capacities, including through the disarmament of Hezbollah. By doing so, it was hoped the country could achieve stability and begin the process of an economic recovery badly needed following its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanons-financial-crisis-how-it-happened-2022-01-23/\">October 2019</a> financial meltdown.</p>\n\n<p>Yet disarming Hezbollah has proved to be extremely challenging. Hezbollah was – and arguably still is – the most powerful military force in Lebanon. Its military might had enabled it not only to establish a perceived balance of deterrence with Israel, but to position itself as a critical player in Lebanese politics. Willingly giving up its arms to the Lebanese state would be tantamount to fundamentally transforming its “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2020.1779587\">resistance</a>” identity and relinquishing political power to other Lebanese parties and sectarian forces.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Soldiers with helmets on a patrol.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704652/original/file-20251125-56-5cj849.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.N. peacekeepers secure an area in southern Lebanon following the beginning of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon on Nov. 27, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TrumpUNPeacekeepingLebanon/75082f5511ba4fd4914b510da1c4356d/photo\">AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Carrying out the disarmament of Hezbollah in line with the ceasefire is theoretically a job for the Lebanese army. But since its foundation in 1945, the army has mainly operated as a symbol of the country’s sovereignty rather than as practical defender – even in times of acute crises such as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War\">civil war from 1975 to 1990</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The army does not have the military capacity, political clout or will to force Hezbollah to give up its arms. If it tried coercively, it would likely lead to armed resistance that might spiral into a new civil war.

This could give Hezbollah a lifeline at a time when the rest of the country is begging, <a href=\"https://thisisbeirut.com.lb/articles/1329659/-lebanon-faces-donor-backlash-after-decision-extending-disability-benefits-to-hezbollah-fighters\">unsuccessfully, for foreign aid</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>The risk of renewed war</h2>\n\n<p>These dynamics put Israel and Hezbollah on a risky path of <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-874484\">continued friction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After its 2006 war against Israel, Hezbollah built a perceived <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mepo.12689\">balance of deterrence</a> that, until Oct. 7, 2023, Israel had accepted as a fait accompli.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-11-24/ty-article/.premium/lebanon-escalation-serves-netanyahus-interests-and-has-trumps-blessing/0000019a-b28c-d67f-adbe-fecffd680000\">remains unpopular</a>. He was roundly accused of prolonging the war in Gaza to deflect from his own legal problems and his government’s deficiencies. And that remains a distinct possibility when it comes to Lebanon, too. </p>\n\n<p>Resolving existing border disputes between the two countries, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, would be significant. Since 2000, such disputes have been used by Hezbollah as an excuse to continue its armed struggle against Israel. And in general, <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/defining-and-stabilizing-lebanons-borders\">the lack of defined Lebanese borders with both Syria and Israel</a> has been a constant source of conflict. </p>\n\n<p>But so far, any diplomatic efforts have failed to materialize over ongoing <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/lebanese-prime-minister-accuses-israel-of-refusing-to-negotiate-on-border-disputes/\">deep mistrust</a> and, despite the ceasefire, active conflict. </p>\n\n<p>As of now, there are only dim prospects for that to change, absent unlikely U.S. pressure. On the Israeli side, any border agreement that would entail ceding territory to Lebanon is politically untenable, and the current right-wing government is showing little interest in diplomacy. For Lebanon, the weakness of the central government in the face of Hezbollah’s still-significant power, along with Israel’s ongoing military actions, makes practical negotiations exceedingly difficult. </p>\n\n<h2>The same old sordid tune?</h2>\n\n<p>Instead, what appears to be unfolding is a return to the vicious cycle that has characterized Israel-Lebanon relations since the late 1960s: Hezbollah and other nonstate actors in Lebanon respond to Israeli military incursions, only to be met with further Israeli retaliation. That, in turn, further weakens the Lebanese state – yet Lebanese state capacity remains the only way to break the vicious cycle. </p>\n\n<p>The key for calm in Lebanon may be again in the hands of the U.S. administration, with the support of an extended regional coalition, perhaps even by including Iran in the deal. </p>\n\n<p>So far, most American diplomacy in the Lebanon-Israel context has been to pressure Beirut. Avoiding renewed war on the Israel-Lebanon front may require U.S. coercive diplomacy, where the pressure is more equally distributed on each party. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, only a strong and stable Lebanon, where the state is the sole holder of arms and in charge of foreign policy, can move us past the current cycle. Israeli military pressure will not get us far in this direction. It must come mainly through an internal Lebanese political process.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270423/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Asher Kaufman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Amid current concerns about the public’s trust in science, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\">old arguments</a> are <a href=\"https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/12/medicine-and-numbers/what-proportion-published-research-findings-are-false\">resurfacing</a> that can sow confusion.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NtwkQ7MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">statistician involved in research</a> for many years, I know the care that goes into designing a good study capable of coming up with meaningful results. Understanding what the results of a particular study are and are not saying can help you sift through what you see in the news or on social media. </p>\n\n<p>Let me walk you through the scientific process, from investigation to publication. The research results you hear about crucially depend on the way scientists formulate the questions they’re investigating.</p>\n\n<h2>The scientific method and the null hypothesis</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers in all kinds of fields use the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method\">scientific method</a> to investigate the questions they’re interested in.</p>\n\n<p>First, a scientist formulates a new claim – what’s called a hypothesis. For example, is having some genetic mutations in BRCA genes related to a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet\">higher risk of breast cancer</a>? Then they gather data relevant to the hypothesis and decide, based on the data, whether that initial claim was correct or not.</p>\n\n<p>It’s intuitive to think that this decision is cleanly dichotomous – that the researcher decides the hypothesis is either true or false. But of course, just because you decide something doesn’t mean you’re right.</p>\n\n<p>If the claim is really false but the researcher decides, based on the evidence, it’s true – a false positive – they commit what’s called a <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-categorical-proportions/error-probabilities-power/v/introduction-to-type-i-and-type-ii-errors\">Type 1 error</a>. If the claim is really true but the researcher fails to see that – a false-negative conclusion – then they commit a Type 2 error.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, in the real world, it gets a little messier. It’s really hard to decide about the truth or falsity of a claim just based on what’s observed.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason, most scientists employ what is called the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1537891\">null hypothesis significance testing</a> framework. Here’s how it works: A researcher first states a “null hypothesis,” something that’s contrary to what they want to prove. For instance, in our example the null hypothesis is that BRCA genetic mutations are not associated with increased breast cancer occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>The scientist still gathers data and makes a decision, but the decision is not about whether the null is true. Instead, a researcher decides whether there’s enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"man in white coat in lab looking at tablet\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704331/original/file-20251124-56-x5gb20.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Careful statistical analysis along with a well-formulated null hypothesis lend confidence to a study finding.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/researcher-in-lab-coat-stressed-while-studying-dna-royalty-free-image/2229038550\">Jackyenjoyphotography/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What rejecting the null does and doesn’t mean</h2>\n\n<p>Understanding this distinction is crucial. Rejecting the null is equivalent in practice to acting as though it is false – in the example, rejecting the null means claiming that those with some BRCA gene mutations do have a higher risk of breast cancer. Along with other evidence, such as the size of the increased risk, this outcome can justify recommending early breast cancer screening <a href=\"https://www.basser.org/brca/brca-women\">for people with the identified BRCA mutations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But failing to reject the null hypothesis doesn’t imply that it’s true – in this case, it doesn’t mean there is no association between the BRCA mutations and breast cancer. Rather, such a result is inconclusive; there’s not enough evidence to claim there is an association. A negative result – inadequate evidence to say the null is false – does not necessarily invite the researcher to believe the null is true. </p>\n\n<p>This is because null hypothesis significance testing is set up to control for Type 1 error (false positive) at a level defined in advance by the researcher but at the cost of having less control over Type 2 error (false negative).</p>\n\n<p>A researcher’s chances of correctly rejecting the null if there is increased risk can depend on how much data they have, how complex the design of the study is and, most importantly, how large the effect actually is. It’s much easier to reject the null if BRCA mutations truly increase cancer risk many times than it is if the risk is only slightly elevated. A researcher can end up with a result that is not statistically significant but cannot rule out the possibility of an increased risk that is too small for the study to detect.</p>\n\n<h2>Which results are more often publicized</h2>\n\n<p>Once they have their result and the researchers want to disseminate their work, they typically do so through <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-peer-review-the-role-anonymous-experts-play-in-scrutinizing-research-before-it-gets-published-258255\">peer-reviewed publication</a>. Journal publishers consider a researcher’s write-up of their study, send it out for other scientists to review, and then decide whether to publish it.</p>\n\n<p>In this process, the publishers tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2025.2538066\">favor studies that rejected their null hypothesis</a> over those that failed to reject it. This is called positive publication bias.</p>\n\n<p>It is natural for publishers to prefer studies that support new claims since they objectively carry more information than studies that failed to reject their null hypothesis. Journals want to publish something new and noteworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Many sources flag this phenomenon as “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4103/sja.SJA_124_19\">bad science</a>,” but is it really? Remember, the framework used to make decisions about scientific claims is intentionally only capable of either rejecting the null hypothesis – in other words, supporting the claim – or alternatively declaring inconclusive results.</p>\n\n<p>The framework isn’t designed to be able to prove the null hypothesis. That said, researchers can reverse the design of a scientific investigation so that a previous claim becomes the null hypothesis in a new study with fresh data.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, rather than a null hypothesis that there is no association between BRCA mutations and breast cancer, the null hypothesis becomes that the increased breast cancer risk from BRCA mutations is equal to or greater than some value the researcher settles on before gathering fresh data.</p>\n\n<p>Rejecting the null this time would mean the increased risk is smaller than that set value, thus supporting the claim consistent with what had previously been the null hypothesis on prior data. In the example, rejecting the null means the effect of BRCA genes is small enough to be practically negligible in terms of developing breast cancer.</p>\n\n<p>It’s critical for a researcher to structure their study so that what they’re interested in proving is aligned with the rejection of the null. Publishers are naturally less inclined to consider studies that failed to reject their null hypothesis, not because they do not want to publish studies that support negative statements but because null hypothesis significance testing does not actually support negative statements. Failure to reject the null just means your results are inconclusive – and may perhaps seem less newsworthy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"library shelves with research journals\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704092/original/file-20251124-56-r2gn3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Research journals want to publish results that will have an impact.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/books-and-magazines-in-a-college-library-royalty-free-image/183260980\">luoman/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What positive publication bias does</h2>\n\n<p>So what does the practice of preferring to publish studies that reject their null hypothesis do?</p>\n\n<p>While we can’t know for certain, we can see how this plays out under different circumstances. You can explore the scenarios <a href=\"https://levelalpha005.shinyapps.io/shiny1/\">in this app</a> I made.</p>\n\n<p>If scientists are acting in good faith, using null hypothesis significance testing appropriately, it turns out that positive publication bias on the part of scientific journal publishers will increase the proportion of true discoveries in their pages much more than it will increase the proportion of false positives.</p>\n\n<p>If editors did not exercise any positive publication bias, journals would be almost entirely full of studies with inconclusive results.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if scientists are not acting in good faith and are just interested in getting published while ignoring proper use of statistical tests, that can lead to false-positive rates being as high or higher than the rate of true discoveries. But this possibility is true even without positive publication bias.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264854/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mark Louie Ramos does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

To bystanders witnessing it being administered, naloxone can appear almost supernatural.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Naloxone\">approved naloxone for medical use in 1971</a> and for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-approval-of-over-the-counter-narcan-is-an-important-step-in-the-effort-to-combat-the-us-opioid-crisis-198497\">over-the-counter purchase in 2023</a>, exactly how it works is still unclear. Researchers know naloxone acts on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/your-body-naturally-produces-opioids-without-causing-addiction-or-overdose-studying-how-this-process-works-could-help-reduce-the-side-effects-of-opioid-drugs-204522\">opioid receptors</a>, a family of proteins responsible for the body’s response to pain. When opioids such as morphine <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-fentanyl-and-why-is-it-behind-the-deadly-surge-in-us-drug-overdoses-a-medical-toxicologist-explains-182629\">and fentanyl</a> bind to these receptors, they produce not only pain relief and euphoria but also dangerous side effects. Naloxone competes with opioids for access to these receptors, preventing the drugs from triggering effects in the body. How it does this at the molecular level, however, has been an ongoing question.</p>\n\n<p>In our recently published research in the journal Nature, my team and I were able to provide some definitive evidence of how naloxone works by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">capturing images of it in action</a> for the first time.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CM6kgzRxyc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Knowing how to use naloxone can save lives.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Biology of opioids</h2>\n\n<p>To better grasp how naloxone works, it’s helpful to first zoom in on the biology behind opioids.</p>\n\n<p>One member of the family of opioid receptors, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/oprm1/\">MOR – short for µ-opioid receptor</a> – is a central player in regulating the body’s response to pain. It sits on the surface of neurons, mostly in the brain and spinal cord, and acts as a communication hub.</p>\n\n<p>When an opioid – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.120.119388\">such as an endorphin</a>, the body’s natural painkillers – interacts with MOR, it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2420623122\">changes the structure of the receptor</a>. This change in shape allows what’s called a G protein to bind to the receptor and trigger a signal to the rest of the body to reduce pain, induce pleasure, or – in the case of overdose – dangerously slow breathing and heart rate. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of different configurations of MOR\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703749/original/file-20251120-56-8a21lr.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When a molecule binds to the µ-opioid receptor, it changes its structure and elicits an effect.

The G protein is the mechanism inside the lock that turns when the correct key – in this case, an endorphin or a drug like fentanyl – goes in. For decades, scientists believed that an opioid’s ability to enable this signaling cascade was linked to how effectively it reshaped the structure of the receptor – essentially, whether the lock could open wide enough for the internal mechanism of the G-protein to engage.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, recent research – including our work – has revealed that the critical step to how opioids work is not how wide they open the lock but how well the mechanism works. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/qrd.2021.7\">G proteins act like a switch</a>, releasing one molecule in exchange for another molecule that triggers the protein to send the signal that sets off opioid effects.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, drugs like fentanyl, by acting on the receptor, transmit physical changes to G proteins that result in the switch flipping more rapidly. What we now see is that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">naloxone jams the mechanism</a>, preventing the switch from flipping and sending the signal.</p>\n\n<h2>Capturing the switch</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers know that the effects of opioids are triggered when the G protein switch is flipped. But what does this process look like?</p>\n\n<p>For years, attempts to visualize this mechanism were largely limited to two states – before the G protein binds to the µ-opioid receptor, and after the molecule was released from the G protein. The states in between were considered too unstable to isolate. My team and I wanted to capture these unseen states moment by moment as the switch flips and the molecule is released. </p>\n\n<p>To do this, we used a technique called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/visualizing-the-inside-of-cells-at-previously-impossible-resolutions-provides-vivid-insights-into-how-they-work-195873\">cryo-electron microscopy</a>, which freezes molecules in motion to visualize them at near-atomic resolution. For both naloxone and the opioid drug loperamide (Imodium), we trapped the G protein bound to the opioid receptor right before it released the molecule.</p>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">captured four distinct structural states</a> leading up to the release of the molecule from the G protein.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these, which we call the latent state, is the earliest form of the opioid receptor and G protein after they make contact. We found that both the opioid receptor and the G protein are inactive at this point. Moreover, naloxone stabilizes this latent state. What this means is that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">naloxone effectively jams the mechanism</a> right at the start, preventing all subsequent steps required for activation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of MOR and G protein in six different states of activation\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=163&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=163&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=163&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=205&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=205&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703747/original/file-20251120-56-prkcrw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=205&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">How the µ-opioid receptor (top half of the structure) and G protein (bottom half of the structure) are configured is key to the effects of naloxone and opioids.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">Saif Khan et al/Nature</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the absence of naloxone, an opioid drug promotes a transition to the remaining three states: The G-protein rotates and aligns itself with the receptor (engaged), swings open the door blocking the molecule that would trigger the switch from flipping (unlatched), and holds that door open so the molecule can be released (primed) and send the signal to carry out the drug’s effects. </p>\n\n<p>To confirm that our snapshots reflect what’s really happening, we performed extensive computational simulations to watch these four states change over time. Together, these findings point to the molecular root of naloxone’s therapeutic effects: By stalling the opioid receptor and G protein at a latent state, it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09677-6\">shuts down opioid signaling</a>, reversing an opioid overdose within minutes.</p>\n\n<h2>Visualizing new drugs</h2>\n\n<p>Designing a new key for a lock is most successfully done when you <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/90-of-drugs-fail-clinical-trials-heres-one-way-researchers-can-select-better-drug-candidates-174152\">know exactly what that lock looks like</a>. By mapping the exact sequence of how opioids interact with opioid receptors and pinpointing where different drugs can intervene in this process, our findings provide a blueprint for engineering the next generation of opioid medicines and overdose antidotes. </p>\n\n<p>For example, one of the persistent challenges with naloxone is that it must often be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.51839\">administered repeatedly during an overdose</a>. This is especially the case for fentanyl overdoses, where the opioid can outcompete or outlast the effects of the treatment. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing that naloxone works by stalling the µ-opioid receptor in an early, latent state suggests that molecules that can bind more tightly or more selectively to this form of the receptor could be more effective at stabilizing this inactive state and thus preventing an opioid’s effects.</p>\n\n<p>By uncovering the structure of molecules involved in opioid signaling, researchers may be able to develop drugs that provide longer-lasting protection against overdose.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269706/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health. </span></em></p>",

After ending the 1962 season with an 11-3 record and a Playoff Bowl victory for third place in the NFL, the NFL commissioner’s office fined six Lions for gambling on the championship game between Green Bay and New York. More significant on field, the commissioner suspended Lions great defensive tackle and future Pro Football Hall of Famer Alex Karras for one year. Without him, the Lions would end the <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/index.htm\">1963 season 5-8-1</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton wrote his way onto the team by promising to “just hang around on the periphery of things and not bother anyone, just try to participate enough to get the feel of things.” </p>\n\n<p>Wilson agreed, and Plimpton arrived at training camp a few months later with his own football, purchased from an army-navy store in Times Square, and a “mild fiction” about having played quarterback at Harvard and for the nonexistent Newfoundland Newfs. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton’s attempt at deception might raise ethical questions; however, the joke is always on him. The coaching staff seemed to have thought it would be hilarious if anyone on the team actually took the gangly 36-year-old with the nasal accent as a professional football player. It seems unlikely that anyone did. </p>\n\n<p>“I never had the temerity to pretend I was something that I wasn’t,” Plimpton wrote. “The team caught on quickly enough.”</p>\n\n<p>At camp, Plimpton hung around the dining hall and sat in the back of team meetings. A master of small talk, he lets the reader eavesdrop on conversations with Hall of Famers Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane and Joe Schmidt. </p>\n\n<p>Plimpton takes us with him one night to a bar frequented by coaches, where we listen in rounds of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5HycgBnqxk\">liars’ poker</a> with Wilson, Scooter McLean and Les Bingaman. We tag along as he chats with Karras at <a href=\"https://www.vintagedetroit.com/remembering-detroits-original-sports-bar-the-lindell-ac/?srsltid=AfmBOooI-Rz0iLwMNRSBFd_ffghWlfuIv5SxuuLzkozcj0QC7G2r81Ds\">Lindell’s A.C.</a>, the bar the player owned in downtown Detroit at the time.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons in grit</h2>\n\n<p>At training camp, Plimpton faced the teasing of players but earned respect by facing the brutality of sport and by persisting despite the  inevitability of pain. He never played football in school, beyond a beery game between <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/\">Harvard Crimson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.harvardlampoon.com/read\">Harvard Lampoon</a>, and did not know the basics of playing quarterback. </p>\n\n<p>Several days into camp, he was allowed to participate in a play where, as quarterback, he was supposed to quickly hand off the ball to another player. </p>\n\n<p>“At ‘two’ the snap back came,” Plimpton wrote. “I began to turn without the proper grip on the ball, moving too nervously, and I fumbled the ball, gaping at it, mouth ajar, as it fell and bounced twice, once away from me, then back, and rocked back and forth gaily at my feet. I flung myself on it (…) and I heard the sharp strange whack of gear, the grunts, and then a quick sudden weight whooshed the air out of me.” </p>\n\n<p>The same thing happened when Plimpton was allowed to take the field in an annual intra-squad game played in Pontiac. Over his first three plays he lost 20 yards by falling down, getting knocked over by his own teammates and being literally picked from the ground by a zealous defender. On the bus ride home, Plimpton admitted to Wilson that he didn’t like being hit. </p>\n\n<p>The coach gently explained that “love of physical contact” was necessary to make it in pro football.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When kids, out in a park, chose of sides for tackle rather than touch, the guys that want to be ends and go out for the passes, or even quarterback, because they think subconsciously they can get rid of the ball before being hit, those guys don’t end up as football players,” Wilson mused. “They become great tennis players, or skiers, or high jumpers. It doesn’t mean they lack courage or competitiveness.” </p>\n\n<p>“But the guys who put up their hands to be tackles or guards, or fullbacks who run not for daylight but for trouble – those are the ones who will make it as football players.” </p>\n\n<p>This quality of great football players – an irrational enthusiasm for bruising physical contact – is celebrated by Plimpton in the veteran Lions who take him into their orbit. He becomes friends with Karras and offensive lineman John Gordy, in particular, and shoots the breeze on topics ranging from the NFL commissioner to Adolf Hitler. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/george-plimpton/mad-ducks-and-bears/9780316326445/?lens=little-brown\">a subsequent book</a>, Plimpton goes with the pair to a madcap golf tournament and starts a ridiculous business venture, suggesting the on-field madness necessary to succeed in football bleeds into off-field life as well. </p>\n\n<p>But it is not Plimpton’s way to delve into the psychology of his idols. Rather, he listens as they spin tales that show how reckless the grown men who run toward trouble really are.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267946/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephen Siff does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Mark Kelly</a>, a Democrat, who is a retired Navy captain, decorated combat veteran and former NASA astronaut.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly and five other members of Congress with military or intelligence backgrounds told members of the armed forces “You can refuse illegal orders” in a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/just-follow-orders-or-obey-the-law-what-us-troops-told-us-about-refusing-illegal-commands-270401\">video released on Nov. 18</a>, reiterating oaths that members of the military and the intelligence community swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. The legislators said they acted in response to concerns expressed by troops currently serving on active duty.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump called the video “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-democrats-death-penalty-sedition-military-orders-rcna245003\">seditious behavior, punishable by death</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Retired senior officers like Kelly can be recalled to duty at any time, which would make it possible for the Pentagon to put Kelly on trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, although the Defense Department announcement did not specify possible charges. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1993008532187148582\">wrote online</a> that “Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”</p>\n\n<p>This threat to punish Kelly is just the latest move by the Trump administration against perceived enemies at home. By branding critics and opponents as disloyal, traitorous or worse, Trump and his supporters are resurrecting a playbook that hearkens back to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40971992.pdf\">Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s crusade</a> against people he portrayed as domestic threats to the U.S. in the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p>As a historian who studies <a href=\"https://artsci.tamu.edu/history/contact/profiles/gregory-a-daddis.html\">national security and the Cold War era</a>, I know that McCarthyism wrought <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/2552/culture-cold-war\">devastating social and cultural harm</a> across our nation. In my view, repeating what I believe constitutes social and political fratricide could be just as harmful today, perhaps even more so.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DRc5XTOCdD_&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Targeting homegrown enemies</h2>\n\n<p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, many Americans believed the United States was a nation under siege. Despite their victory in World War II, Americans <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/faith-and-fear-9780197804223?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">saw a dangerous world confronting them</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The communist-run Soviet Union held Eastern Europe in an iron grip. In 1949, Mao Zedong’s communist troops triumphed in the bloody <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Chinese-Civil-War\">Chinese civil war</a>. One year later, the Korean peninsula descended into full-scale conflict, raising the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/korea-and-fear-world-war-iii#\">World War III</a> – a frightening possibility in the atomic era.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-communist zealots in the U.S., most notably Wisconsin Republican Sen. McCarthy, argued that treasonous Americans were weakening the nation at home. During a February 1950 speech in <a href=\"https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/McCarthy_Wheeling_Speech.pdf\">Wheeling, West Virginia</a>, McCarthy asserted that “the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this nation” were undermining the United States during its “final, all-out battle” against communism.</p>\n\n<p>When communist forces toppled China’s government, critics such as political activist <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/utley-freda-1898-1977\">Freda Utley</a> lambasted President Harry Truman’s administration for what they cast as its timidity, blundering and, worse, “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/chinastory011649mbp/mode/2up?q=treason\">treason in high places</a>.” Conflating foreign and domestic threats, McCarthy claimed without evidence that homegrown enemies “within our borders have been <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/josephrmccarthy00matu/page/46/mode/2up?q=%22within+our+borders+have+been+more+responsible%22\">more responsible for the success of communism abroad</a> than Soviet Russia.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/97reHqY6oPo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">From 1950 through 1954, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican, used his role as chair of two powerful Senate committees to identify and accuse people he thought were Communist sympathizers. Many of those accused lost their jobs even when there was little or no evidence to support the accusations.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As ostensible proof, the senator pointed to American lives being lost in Korea and argued that it was possible to “fully fight a war abroad and at the same time … dispose of the traitorous filth and the Red vermin which have accumulated at home.”</p>\n\n<p>Political opponents might <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpwashingtonpost/docview/152427336/EE18A76FF0074046PQ/4?accountid=13758&amp;sourcetype=Newspapers\">disparage McCarthy</a> for his “dishonest and cowardly use of fractional fact and innuendo,” but the Wisconsinite knew how to play to the press. Time and again, McCarthy would bombastically lash out against his critics as he did with columnist <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Columnist.html?id=b-MmEAAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description\">Drew Pearson</a>, calling him “an unprincipled liar,” “a fake” and the owner of a “twisted perverted mentality.”</p>\n\n<p>While McCarthy focused on allegedly disloyal government officials and media journalists, other self-pronounced protectors of the nation sought to warn naive members of the public. Defense Department pamphlets like “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Know_Your_Communist_Enemy/Pode7xN4d8YC\">Know Your Communist Enemy</a>” alerted Americans against being duped by Communist Party  members skilled in deception and manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>Virulent anti-communists denounced what they viewed as inherent weaknesses of postwar American society, with a clearly political bent. Republicans asserted that cowardly, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo193960577.html\">effeminate liberals</a> were weakening the nation’s defense by minimizing threats both home and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQDO3nEkX8F&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Censure and worse</h2>\n\n<p>In such an anxiety-ridden environment, “<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?vid=9780811828871&amp;hl=en\">red-baiting</a>” – discrediting political opponents by linking them to communism – spread across the country, leaving a trail of wrecked lives. From teachers to public officials, anyone deemed un-American by McCarthyites faced public censure, loss of employment or even imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Under the 1940 <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/cold-war-political-justice-9780837196923/\">Smith Act</a>, which criminalized promoting the overthrow of the U.S. government, hundreds of Americans were prosecuted during the Cold War simply for having been members of the Communist Party of the United States. The act also authorized the “deportation of aliens,” reflecting fears that communist ideas had seeped into nearly all facets of American society.</p>\n\n<p>The 1950 <a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/64/STATUTE-64-Pg987.pdf\">Internal Security Act</a>, widely known as the McCarran Act, further emphasized existential threats from within. “Disloyal aliens,” a term the law left purposefully vague, could have their citizenship revoked. Communist Party members were required to register with the government, a step that made them susceptible to prosecution under the Smith Act.</p>\n\n<p>Immigrants could be detained or deported if the president declared an “internal security emergency.” Advocates called this policy “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1119245.pdf\">preventive detention</a>,” while critics derided the act as a “<a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/the-rise-and-fall-of-america-s-concentration-camp-law-1\">Concentration Camp Law</a>,” in the words of historian Masumi Izumi.</p>\n\n<h2>Scapegoating outsiders</h2>\n\n<p>The scaremongering wasn’t just about people’s political views: Vulnerable groups, such as gay people, were also targeted. McCarthy warned of links between “<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691048703/many-are-the-crimes\">communists and queers</a>,” asserting that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/16/archives/federal-vigilance-on-perverts-asked-senate-group-says-they-must-be.html\">sexual perverts</a>” had infested the U.S. government, especially the State Department, and posed “dangerous security risks.” Closeted gay or lesbian employees, the argument went, were vulnerable to blackmail by foreign governments.</p>\n\n<p>Fearmongering also took on a decidedly racist tone. South Carolina Governor <a href=\"https://medium.com/history-uncut/the-cold-war-comes-home-39a7978a5907\">George Bell Timmerman, Jr.</a>, for instance, argued in 1957 that enforcing “Negro voting rights” would promote the “cause of communism.” </p>\n\n<p>Three years later, a comic book titled <a href=\"https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/communism/The%20Red%20Iceberg/\">“The Red Iceberg</a>” insinuated that communists were exploiting the “tragic plight” of Black families and that the <a href=\"https://naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, a leading U.S. civil rights advocacy group, had been infiltrated by the Kremlin. Conservatives like Arizona <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/conservatism/conservatism-civil-rights\">Sen. Barry Goldwater</a> criticized the growing practice of using federal power to enforce civil rights, calling it communist-style social engineering.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YwVxLgWaTY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In an interview on Oct. 13, 2024, then-candidate Donald Trump described Democratic Party rivals as ‘the enemy from within’ and suggested using the armed forces against ‘radical left lunatics’ on Election Day.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A new McCarthyism</h2>\n\n<p>While it’s never simple to draw neat historical parallels from past eras to the present, it appears McCarthy-like actions are recurring widely today. During the Red Scare, the focus was on alleged communists. Today, the focus is on straightforward dissent. Critics, both past and present, of President Donald Trump’s actions and policies are being targeted.</p>\n\n<p>At the national level, Trump has called for using military force against “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-military-enemy-from-within-election-day\">the enemy from within</a>.” On Sept. 30, 2025, Trump told hundreds of generals and admirals who had been <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-directs-generals-defend-us-war/story?id=126087035\">called to Quantico, Virginia</a>, from posts around the world that the National Guard should view America’s “dangerous cities as training grounds.” </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration is making <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-law-from-the-era-of-red-scares-is-supercharging-trump-administrations-power-over-immigrants-and-noncitizens-255307\">expansive use of the McCarran Act</a> to crack down on immigrants in U.S. cities. White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/stephen-miller-says-we-can-suspend-habeas-corpus-because-we-are-being-invaded-own-words-belie\">Stephen Miller</a> has proposed suspending the constitutionally protected <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus\">writ of habeas corpus</a>, which entitles prisoners to challenge their detentions in court, in order to deport “illegal aliens,” alleging that the U.S. is “under invasion.” </p>\n\n<p>In my home state of Texas, political fearmongering has taken on an equally McCarthyesque tone, with the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/21/texas-communism-dangers-schools-fascism\">Legislature directing</a> the State Board of Education to adopt mandatory instruction on “atrocities attributable to communist regimes.” </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that right-wing activist Laura Loomer has unapologetically called for <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/laura-loomer-trump-mccarthyism-rcna226607\">“making McCarthy great again.”</a></p>\n\n<h2>Disagreement is democratic</h2>\n\n<p>The history of McCarthyism shows where this kind of action can lead. Charging political opponents <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-accuses-obama-treason-oval-office/story?id=123963917\">with treason</a> and calling the media an “<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/enemy-of-the-people/\">enemy of the people</a>,” all without evidence, undercuts democratic principles. </p>\n\n<p>These actions cast certain groups as different and dehumanize them. Portraying political rivals as existential threats, simply for disagreeing with their fellow citizens or political leaders, promotes forced consensus. This diminishes debate and can lead to bad policies. </p>\n\n<p>Americans live in an insecure world today, but as I see it, demonizing enemies won’t make the United States a safer place. Instead, it only will lead to the kind of harm that was brought to pass by the very worst tendencies of McCarthyism.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265964/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gregory A.

I relocated from Hawaii, where I had learned the Hawaiian language. </p>\n\n<p>When I arrived in Colorado, I decided I needed to learn about the Indigenous language of the Boulder and Denver area, Arapaho. The <a href=\"https://www.northernarapaho.com/\">Arapaho people</a> had occupied the area for many years until <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/project/arapaho/contemporary-life/history-northern-arapaho-tribe\">they were forced to leave in the 1860s</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I first visited the Northern Arapaho people on <a href=\"https://windriver.org/destinations/wind-river-indian-reservation/\">the Wind River Reservation</a> in Wyoming in 1999. At that time, there were hundreds of speakers of the Arapaho language. </p>\n\n<p>Today, there are less than 100, and all are over the age of 70. </p>\n\n<p>The Arapaho people in Wyoming and Colorado believe their language can still survive, and so do I. That’s why I am working to combine decades of language documentation with new technological approaches in order to help revive the language.</p>\n\n<h2>Loss of Native languages</h2>\n\n<p>Many Native American languages currently have <a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/endangered-languages-of-the-united-states.html\">few Native speakers</a>, and the speakers are typically <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/25/1233819688/the-race-to-save-indigenous-languages\">the oldest members of the community</a>. The languages of the Wichita and Kansa people, for example, are among <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinct_languages_of_North_America\">many that are no longer spoken at all</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Native American <a href=\"https://hir.harvard.edu/the-death-and-revival-of-indigenous-languages/\">languages have been in decline</a> in the face of Euro-American pressure for centuries. </p>\n\n<p>On the Great Plains, this decline <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/478774544/5-American-Indian-languages\">accelerated after World War II</a> when Native soldiers came home after seeing prosperity off the reservation. </p>\n\n<p>Arapaho elders tell me that bilingual parents decided to speak only English to their children to improve their chances of success in life. They were certain the tribal languages would come “later.” </p>\n\n<p>But “later” didn’t happen. Boarding schools had already been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-native-students-fought-back-against-abuse-and-assimilation-at-us-boarding-schools-165222\">suppressing the language</a>, and now economic improvements brought cars, radios and televisions to Wind River, further promoting the use of English. Without language exposure in the home, children were not able to acquire good speaking abilities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOy6KGljBC4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A documentary from Rocky Mountain PBS about Native American people who lost their language as children.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, however, tribal communities around the country increasingly <a href=\"https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/bia_native_american_revitalization_lit_review_draft_08182023.pdf\">want to maintain or reacquire their languages</a>. Efforts to do this have been going on for several decades, with some successes, such as the <a href=\"https://nativesciencereport.org/2018/12/when-you-come-in-this-house-you-speak-mohawk/\">Mohawk language of New York and Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://language.cherokee.org/language-programs/\">Cherokee in Oklahoma and North Carolina</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pieganinstitute.org/\">Blackfoot language of northern Montana</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In most places however, numbers of Native speakers continue to decline, while learning among younger speakers progresses slowly. </p>\n\n<h2>Uses of data for curriculum</h2>\n\n<p>My early work focused on documenting the Arapaho language. Past linguists working with Native languages <a href=\"https://cla.berkeley.edu/\">typically focused on traditional storytelling</a>, as well as audio-recorded data. But my interest in anthropology led me to focus on conversation and everyday interaction. I also recorded on video to capture social settings, gestures and sign language. And to better understand the role of the language in daily use, I worked to become a good speaker myself.</p>\n\n<p>I have compiled my documentation into a database that contains over 100,000 sentences of natural Arapaho speech. All of this has been transcribed, translated into English and accompanied by detailed linguistic analysis. </p>\n\n<p>The database is further supported by <a href=\"https://verbs.colorado.edu/ArapahoLanguageProject/index.html\">an online learning site</a> and an <a href=\"https://verbs.colorado.edu/arapaho/public/view_search\">online dictionary of around 25,000</a> entries. They are among the largest such resources for an Indigenous language, though resources do exist for other languages, <a href=\"https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/%7Eyurok/web/resources.php\">such as Yurok</a>. </p>\n\n<p><audio preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\" data-duration=\"1\" data-image=\"\" data-title=\"\" data-size=\"14109\" data-source=\"Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.\" data-source-url=\"\" data-license=\"\" data-license-url=\"\">\n        <source src=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/audio/3229/hinonoeini-noo.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n      </audio>\n      <div class=\"audio-player-caption\">\n        \n        <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.</span><span class=\"download\"><span>13.8 KB</span> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/audio/3229/hinonoeini-noo.mp3\">(download)</a></span></span>\n      </div></p>\n\n<h2>From documentation to curriculum</h2>\n\n<p>In response to the Arapaho people’s goal of language revitalization, my own work has shifted from documentation to assisting teachers, students and curriculum developers. The database turns out to have great value in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Adult learners can watch the videos along with the Arapaho transcriptions or English translations, or both, and review the detailed grammatical analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is quite difficult for young learners to immediately benefit from listening to natural discourse. That’s why carefully graded curricula are crucial. Unlike for commonly taught languages such as French or Spanish, materials for most <a href=\"https://www.aildi.arizona.edu/nalrc-resources\">Native American languages are just being developed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Arapaho can be challenging to learn because its structure is quite different from English. Many small chunks of meaning are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho_language\">combined to produce long, complex words</a>. For example, an English speaker can start with “happy” and produce “un-happi-ness.” Arapaho speakers typically add three, four or even five prefixes, and multiple suffixes as well. A speaker can say the word “niibeetwonwoteekoohunoo” – which has six separate meaningful chunks. This translates to English, “I want to go and drive to town.”</p>\n\n<p>There is little value in memorizing such complex words, just as English learners don’t memorize entire sentences. Instead, Arapaho learners need to understand the separate parts, and how they combine.</p>\n\n<p>Previous efforts have succeeded in <a href=\"https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/TIL_3.html\">teaching children to speak basic Arapaho</a>. The challenge now is to keep improving their Arapaho language abilities, using a graded curriculum that continues through all school levels.</p>\n\n<p>The database can identify and label the individual chunks of words, and assign meanings to each chunk. A beginner’s dictionary of 1,300 entries has been created by calculating the overall frequency of base words in the 100,000 sentences, and then selecting only the most common ones. </p>\n\n<p>The list has been broken down further to produce target vocabulary for each grade level. Smaller chunks of prefixes and suffixes are also measured, and sequential grammar-learning goals can be produced based on frequency and complexity.</p>\n\n<p>A draft Arapaho learning sequence has been created, with 44 stages. It is now possible for the first time to produce a full, progressive language curriculum for Arapaho. The next step is to develop more curricular materials and train teachers to use them. </p>\n\n<p>The sequence of 44 stages is now being introduced at <a href=\"https://www.wyomingindianschools.com/o/wie\">Wyoming Indian Elementary School</a>, the first school on the Wind River Reservation to pioneer dual-language classrooms.</p>\n\n<h2>Limitations of technology</h2>\n\n<p>Technology is not a magic bullet, however. Only Native people can save their languages, by choosing to learn and speak them. </p>\n\n<p>Because <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models\">artificial intelligence works using large language models</a>, it needs billions of words of discourse to be trained effectively in a language. No Indigenous language has nearly that amount of data, so the capacity of AI to <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/policy/mind-the-language-gap-mapping-the-challenges-of-llm-development-in-low-resource-language-contexts\">address Native language endangerment is limited</a>. Moreover, <a href=\"https://aipi.asu.edu/blog/2025/07/tribal-sovereignty-age-ai-exploring-opportunities-and-risks-tribal-nations\">many Indigenous communities are wary of AI</a> due to concerns over <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2025/08/indigenous-sovereignty-ai-era\">data sovereignty and cultural property</a> rights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in a red gingham shirt holds a colorful quilted blanket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703954/original/file-20251121-70-oifzml.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The author, Andrew Cowell, is recognized for his Arapaho language revitalization at a 2018 ceremony on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of Andrew Cowell.</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>My own old-fashioned experience as a learner and teacher has proved crucial.

Yet, not everyone who dons the red suit fits this stereotype.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what <a href=\"https://www.cob.niu.edu/about/directory/cockburn.shtml\">Bethany Cockburn</a>, <a href=\"https://business.oregonstate.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/bori-borbala-csillag\">Borbala Csillag</a> and I learned when we teamed up to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2023.1161\">study professional Santas</a>. For our study, we looked into how these professional Santas were able to “be” Santa, even if they didn’t fully fit the image.</p>\n\n<p>As we explained in a forthcoming article in the Academy of Management Journal, many who do this work don’t see it as just a job – <a href=\"https://embraceourcalling.com/is-calling-the-same-as-passion/\">it’s a calling</a>. For some professional Santas, it’s especially important that they look and feel like Santa to experience that sense of purpose in their work.</p>\n\n<p>We surveyed 849 professional Santas who live across the U.S. and interviewed 53 of them, collecting data between 2018 and 2021. We identified three types of professional Santas: prototypical (64%), semi-prototypical (23%) and nonprototypical (13%). </p>\n\n<p>Prototypical Santas look the part. They are white and overweight, have real beards and express confidence that they are the right fit.</p>\n\n<p>Semi-prototypical Santas looked the part, too, but felt like they weren’t quite suitable for a range of reasons. They might be introverted or use a fake beard.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprototypical Santas had characteristics at odds with the stereotype. They might be nonwhite, female or gay, or have a physical disability. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Man dressed as Santa holds a dog on his lap.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1333&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704425/original/file-20251125-56-t3kc1c.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1676&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many Santas see their work, whether paid or volunteer, as a calling.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Photo by Gwyn Sussman</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Whereas prototypical Santas could easily slide into the Santa role, the process was more complex for the others.</p>\n\n<p>Semi-prototypical Santas did things like come up with stories they’d tell themselves or share with children to explain away their fake beards. Nonprototypical Santas had values aligned with the Santa image, such as being peaceful, loving and kind. But they still made a big effort to look like what people expect when they visit a Santa. </p>\n\n<p>“Should it be a difference if you’re a Jewish Santa Claus or a Catholic Santa Claus?” asked an atheist professional Santa we called “Santa Aquila.” “No. You’re Santa Claus.

For 43 days, the more than 42 million Americans who receive <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-20849\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a> benefits had to find other ways to stock their cupboards.</p>\n\n<p>When asked how she felt about her benefits being suspended, one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/podcasts/the-daily/snap-food-stamps-shutdown.html\">woman in West Virginia</a> told a New York Times reporter, “We’re angry. Because we do count!” </p>\n\n<p>Her sentiment reflects an often underappreciated fact about food. Food is not just a matter of survival. What and how you eat is also a symbol of your social status. Being unable to reliably feed your family healthy and nutritious foods in a way that aligns with your values can feel undignified. It can make people feel unseen and less important than others. </p>\n\n<p>As researchers who study <a href=\"https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/jbrenton\">food inequality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/9294-alyssa-tindall\">nutrition</a> and <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/fellows/fellows-directory/senbagam-virudachalam-md-mshp/\">food justice</a>, we have spent decades surveying and interviewing Americans about how they eat. We have witnessed firsthand how food assistance does help people meet their basic needs, but how it can also be stigmatizing and diminish their sense of dignity.</p>\n\n<p>We have also studied alternatives to typical charitable food programs that, despite good intentions, tend to induce shame. We have learned that it is possible to help people put food on the table while preserving their dignity.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RpGrZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpGrZ/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Dignity and food assistance</h2>\n\n<p>Addressing the root causes of food insecurity – what happens when people lack steady access to the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/food-insecurity-5704\">food they need for a nutritious diet</a> that’s in keeping with their preferences – is a persistent problem in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\">demand for SNAP benefits</a>, which help Americans buy groceries, <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/programs\">other government nutrition programs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/why-many-struggle-access-charitable-food-while-demand-remains-high\">food banks and food pantries</a> rarely declines much – even when the economy is strong. Yet relying on food assistance programs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2016.08.015\">does not tend to support a healthy diet</a> and can take a toll on mental health.</p>\n\n<p>As interviewers and clinicians, we have heard mothers describe the shame they feel when SNAP benefits do not cover the entire grocery bill. <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pressure-cooker-9780190663292?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">We have witnessed the frustration</a> that comes with walking down a food pantry aisle lined with signs instructing hungry people to “take only 1 item!”</p>\n\n<p>“The stuff looks like almost trash, but they give it to you,” one woman we interviewed said of her experience with food pantries and the like.</p>\n\n<p>These kinds of stories are not uncommon. Charitable food programs receive leftover items from grocery stores, donations from community food drives and local businesses, and sometimes surplus from local farms. Food is often damaged in transport or from being handled too many times. A review of the research found that many people who use food pantries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.10.029\">described the food as unhealthy, moldy or inedible</a>. Being given unhealthy and unappealing food in a time of need is a double burden.</p>\n\n<p>While free food may fill the stomach, it does not satisfy the desire to feel fully human and worthy of nourishment.</p>\n\n<p>People who visit food banks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.029\">have told researchers that they have come to expect</a> low-quality food and few choices. When food aid is provided that way, it can leave the people it is supposed to help <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19320248.2022.2052782\">feeling powerless</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.04.021\">ashamed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These indignities are compounded by the fact that people who visit food banks and food pantries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00909882.2022.2079954\">routinely face suspicion and surveillance</a> around what they buy and how they eat, intensifying the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuac029\">stress associated with food insecurity</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In our research, we saw cashiers hovering over mothers using <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/ebt\">SNAP EBT cards</a> in the self-checkout line. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5595920/snap-usda-rollins-fraud\">Politicians routinely suggest that SNAP is corrupt</a>, contributing to nationwide perceptions that people who rely on this program are unfairly gaming the system. One study found that more than two-thirds of the Americans people who get food assistance have been the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.117959\">target of hostile comments and interactions from strangers at the grocery store</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Minimizing stigma</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0160597617733623\">Several studies</a> have shown that food programs do not need to sacrifice dignity to offer help. Programs that offer opportunities for people with lower incomes to receive and give back are important. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12251\">In Canada, bulk-buying food cooperatives</a> did just that. Food assistance programs confer dignity when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/19320248.2022.2052782\">make people feel good</a>. People seeking help feel more satisfied after visiting food pantries that keep convenient hours or offer fresh produce.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.112909\">SNAP has also tried to promote client dignity</a> by ensuring that benefits are accepted in major grocery stores and distributing the funds to debit cards, allowing people to look and feel like everyday shoppers.</p>\n\n<p>Yet despite these efforts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305362\">social stigma persists</a>. People who are enrolled in the SNAP program are still <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305362\">routinely devalued and judged for being poor</a> in a society that assigns social value and worth based on one’s position on the economic ladder. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A customer shops for groceries in a supermarket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703935/original/file-20251121-62-hxt6dk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Because SNAP benefits can be used to buy food at stores, the program generally allows for broad choices.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/customer-shops-for-produce-at-an-h-e-b-grocery-store-on-news-photo/2199174568?adppopup=true\">Brandon Bell/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Cultivating dignity in food assistance</h2>\n\n<p>Minimizing stigma improves food assistance. Intentionally cultivating food dignity may be the next step.</p>\n\n<p>Our assessment of a nationwide meal kit program demonstrated how dignity can be cultivated when food assistance programs consider the nutritional, emotional, aesthetic and cultural dimensions of food and eating.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, we conducted 116 interviews with participants of a meal kit program called <a href=\"https://www.ahealthieramerica.org/pass-the-love-w-waffles-mochi-29\">Pass the Love</a>. The program was free and anyone could enroll, no questions asked. The meal kits contained the necessary food and recipes to make three vegetarian meals a week, such as sesame coconut noodle salad or carrot coconut dal with rice. The program ran for four consecutive weeks.</p>\n\n<p>When we interviewed participants about their experiences during and after the program, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118009\">we learned</a> that while they were thankful for the free food, what mattered more was the high quality, how it was packaged and how it conveyed care and respect.</p>\n\n<p>Most participants had incomes at or well below the poverty line. They described what we came to call a “high dignity food experience,” meaning that it generated positive feelings and a sense of worth.</p>\n\n<p>Opening the nicely packaged meal kit boxes each week felt like “Christmas,” to some people and a “gift” to others. Many found the “thought and care” that went into the program remarkable. Offering high-quality food to make nutritious, complete meals symbolized that low-income or food-insecure people deserve to eat well and feel good.</p>\n\n<p>Our research, like similar studies that others have conducted, shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huaf016\">treating food as a basic human right</a> requires more than just giving people something to eat. It means ensuring unconditional access to the culturally appropriate fresh and nutritious food people need to thrive not just physically, but psychologically and socially.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269171/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joslyn Brenton received funding from Partnership for a Healthier America as an external research expert. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Virudachalam received funding from the Edna G.

As a scholar who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=RYxWeRcAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies information retrieval</a>, I see that this shift of the tool people reach for first for finding information is at the heart of how ChatGPT has changed everyday technology use.</p>\n\n<h2>Change in searching</h2>\n\n<p>The biggest change isn’t that other tools have vanished. It’s that ChatGPT has become the new front door to information. Within months of its introduction on Nov. 30, 2022, ChatGPT had 100 million weekly users. By late 2025, that figure had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-users-openai-sam-altman-devday-llm-artificial-intelligence-2025-10\">grown to 800 million</a>. That makes it one of the most widely used consumer technologies on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Surveys show that this use isn’t just curiosity – it reflects a real change in behavior. A 2025 Pew Research Center study found that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/06/25/34-of-us-adults-have-used-chatgpt-about-double-the-share-in-2023/\">34% of U.S. adults have used ChatGPT</a>, roughly double the share found in 2023. Among adults under 30, a clear majority (58%) have tried it. An AP-NORC poll reports that about 60% of U.S. adults who use AI <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-poll-229b665d10d057441a69f56648b973e1\">say they use it to search for information</a>, making this the most common AI use case. The number rises to 74% for the under-30 crowd. </p>\n\n<p>Traditional search engines are still the backbone of the online information ecosystem, but the kind of searching people do has shifted in measurable ways since ChatGPT entered the scene. People are changing which tool they reach for first.</p>\n\n<p>For years, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/06/1108679/ai-generative-search-internet-breakthroughs/\">Google was the default</a> for everything from “how to reset my router” to “explain the debt ceiling.” These basic informational queries made up a huge portion of search traffic. But these quick, clarifying, everyday “what does this mean” questions are the ones ChatGPT now answers faster and more cleanly than a page of links. </p>\n\n<p>And people have noticed. A 2025 U.S. consumer survey found that 55% of respondents now use OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini AI chatbots <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/ai-search-is-exploding-6-tasks-people-are-now-giving-to-ai-instead-of-google\">about tasks they previously would have asked Google search</a> to help them with, with even higher usage figures for the U.K. Another analysis of more than 1 billion search sessions found that traffic from generative AI platforms is <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/blog/seo/gen-ai-search-trends/\">growing 165 times faster than traditional searches</a>, and about 13 million U.S. adults have already made generative AI their go-to tool for online discovery.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean people have stopped “Googling,” but it means ChatGPT has peeled off the kinds of questions for which users want a direct explanation instead of a list of links. Curious about a policy update? Need a definition? Want a polite way to respond to an uncomfortable email? ChatGPT is faster, feels more conversational and feels more definitive.  </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Google isn’t standing still. Its search results look different than they did three years ago because Google started weaving its AI system Gemini directly into the top of the page. The “AI Overview” summaries that appear above traditional search links now instantly answer many simple questions – sometimes accurately, sometimes less so. </p>\n\n<p>But either way, many people never scroll past that AI-generated snapshot. This fact combined with the impact of ChatGPT are the reasons the number of “zero-click” searches has surged. One report using Similarweb data found that traffic from Google to news sites fell from over 2.3 billion visits in mid-2024 <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/media/google-ai-tools-depressing-traffic-to-news-sites-report/\">to under 1.7 billion in May 2025</a>, while the share of news-related searches ending in zero clicks jumped from 56% to 69% in one year.</p>\n\n<p>Google search excels at pointing to a wide range of sources and perspectives, but the results can feel cluttered and designed more for clicks than clarity. ChatGPT, by contract, delivers a more focused and conversational response that prioritizes explanation over ranking. The ChatGPT response can lack the source transparency and multiple viewpoints often found in a Google search.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of accuracy, both tools can occasionally get it wrong. Google’s strength lies in letting users cross-check multiple sources, while ChatGPT’s accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the prompt and the<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-search-answers-are-the-fast-food-of-your-information-diet-convenient-and-tasty-but-no-substitute-for-good-nutrition-230759\"> user’s ability to recognize when a response should be verified elsewhere</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-MOQcIqhXo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">OpenAI is aiming to make it even more appealing to turn to ChatPGT first for search by trying to get people to use a browser with ChatGPT built in.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Smart speakers and YouTube</h2>\n\n<p>The impact of ChatGPT has reverberated beyond search engines. Voice assistants, such as Alexa speakers and Google Home, continue to report high ownership, but that number is down slightly. One 2025 summary of voice-search statistics estimates that <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/blog/voice-search-stats/\">about 34% of people ages 12 and up own a smart speaker</a>, down from 35% in 2023. This is not a dramatic decline, but the lack of growth may indicate a shift of more complex queries to ChatGPT or similar tools. When people want a detailed explanation, a step-by-step plan or help drafting something, a voice assistant that answers in a short sentence suddenly feels limited.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, YouTube remains a giant. As of 2024, it had <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/\">approximately 2.74 billion users</a>, with that number increasing steadily since 2010. Among U.S. teens, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/\">about 90% say they use YouTube</a>, making it the most widely used platform in that age group. But what kind of videos people are looking for is changing.</p>\n\n<p>People now tend to start with ChatGPT and then move to YouTube if they need the additional information a how-to video conveys. For many everyday tasks, such as “explain my health benefits” or “help me write a complaint email,” people ask ChatGPT for a summary, script or checklist. They head to YouTube only if they need to see a physical process.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a similar pattern in more specialized spaces. Software engineers, for instance, have long relied on sites such as Stack Overflow for tips and pieces of software code. But question volume there began dropping sharply after ChatGPT’s release, and one analysis suggests <a href=\"https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2025/jan/21/stack-overflows-decline/\">overall traffic fell by about 50% between 2022 and 2024</a>. When a chatbot can generate a code snippet and an explanation on demand, fewer people bother typing a question into a public forum.</p>\n\n<h2>So where does that leave us?</h2>\n\n<p>Three years in, ChatGPT hasn’t replaced the rest of the tech stack; it’s reordered it. The default search has shifted. Search engines are still for deep dives and complex comparisons. YouTube is still for seeing real people do real things. Smart speakers are still for hands-free convenience.  </p>\n\n<p>But when people need to figure something out, many now start with a chat conversation, not a search box. That’s the real ChatGPT effect: It didn’t just add another app to our phones – it quietly changed how we look things up in the first place.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270143/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Deborah Lee does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

These are essentially high-tech, 3D computer models of cities. They are filled with data about buildings, roads and utilities. Built using precision tools like cameras and LiDAR – light detection and ranging – scanners, these twins are great at showing what a city looks like physically.</p>\n\n<p>But in their rush to map the concrete, researchers, software developers and city planners have <a href=\"https://www.geoweeknews.com/news/urban-digital-twin-models-complexity-ai\">missed the most dynamic part of urban life</a>: people. People move, live and interact inside those buildings and on those streets.</p>\n\n<p>This omission creates a serious problem. While an urban digital twin may perfectly replicate the buildings and infrastructure, it often ignores how people use the parks, walk on the sidewalks, or find their way to the bus. This is an incomplete picture; it cannot truly help solve complex urban challenges or guide fair development.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome this problem, digital twins will need to widen their focus beyond physical objects and incorporate realistic human behaviors. Though there is ample data about a city’s inhabitants, using it poses a significant privacy risk. I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=Vz8kG8IAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">public affairs and planning scholar</a>. My colleagues and I believe the solution to producing more complete urban digital twins is to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X251383141\">use synthetic data</a> that closely approximates real people’s data.“</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2hnoGo27uf8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Digital twins are more than simulations.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The privacy barrier</h2>\n\n<p>To build a humane, inclusive digital twin, it’s critical to include detailed data on how people behave. And the model should represent the diversity of a city’s population, including families with young children, disabled residents and retirees. Unfortunately, relying solely on real-world data is impractical and ethically challenging.</p>\n\n<p>The primary obstacles are significant, starting with strict privacy laws. Rules such as the <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation</a>, or GDPR, often prevent researchers and others from widely sharing sensitive personal information. This wall of privacy stops researchers from easily comparing results and limits our ability to learn from past studies.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, real-world data is often unfair. Data collection tends to be uneven, missing large groups of people. Training a computer model using data where low-income neighborhoods have sparse sensor coverage means the model will simply repeat and even magnify that original unfairness. To compensate for this, researchers can use the statistical technique of <a href=\"https://methods.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/chpt/weighting#_\">weighting the data</a> in the models to make up for the underrepresentation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-fake-data-is-a-good-thing-how-synthetic-data-trains-ai-to-solve-real-problems-265180\">Synthetic data</a> offers a practical solution. It is artificial information generated by computers that mimics the statistical patterns of real-world data. This protects privacy while filling critical data gaps.</p>\n\n<h2>Synthetic data: Tool for fairer cities</h2>\n\n<p>Adding synthetic human dynamics fundamentally changes digital twins. It shifts them from static models of infrastructure to dynamic simulations that show how people live in the city. By generating synthetic patterns of walking, bus riding and public space use, planners can include a wider, more inclusive range of human actions in the models.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Bogotá, Colombia, is using a digital twin to model its TransMilenio bus rapid transit system. Instead of relying only on limited or privacy-sensitive real-world sensor data, the city planners generated synthetic data to fill the digital twin. Such data artificially creates millions of simulated bus arrivals, vehicle speeds and queue lengths, all based on the statistical patterns – peak times, off-peak times – of actual <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-85316-6_10\">TransMilenio operations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This approach transforms urban planning in several crucial ways, making simulations more realistic and diverse. For example, planners can use synthetic pedestrian data to model how elderly and disabled residents would navigate a new urban design.</p>\n\n<p>It also allows for risk-free testing of ideas. Planners can simulate diverse synthetic populations to see how a new flood evacuation plan would affect various groups, all without risking anyone’s safety or privacy in the real world.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/soAjc8caTRw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Cities are increasingly building digital twins for planning and development.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Making digital twins trustworthy</h2>\n\n<p>For all the promises of synthetic data, it can only be helpful if planners can trust it. Since they base major decisions on these virtual worlds, the synthetic data must be proved to be a reliable replacement for real-world data. Planners can test this by checking to see if the main policy decisions they reach using the synthetic data are the same ones they would have made using real-world data that puts people’s privacy at risk. If the decisions match, the synthetic data is trustworthy enough to use for that planning task going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond technical checks, it’s important to consider fairness. This means routinely auditing the synthetic models to check for any hidden biases or underrepresentation across different groups. For example, planners can make sure an emergency evacuation plan in the urban digital twin works for elderly residents with mobility issues.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, I believe planners should include their communities. Establishing citizen advisory boards and designing the synthetic data and simulation scenarios directly with the people who live in the city helps ensure that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X251383141\">their experiences are accurately reflected</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By moving beyond static infrastructure to dynamic environments that include people’s behavior, synthetic data is set to play a critical role in urban planning.

These often large, lacy fronds lend themselves nicely to watercolor paintings and tricep tattoos alike. <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9846/pg9846-images.html\">Thoreau said it best</a>: “Nature made ferns for pure leaves, to show what she could do in that line.”</p>\n\n<p>But ferns are not just for art and gardens. While fern leaves are the most iconic part of their body, these plants are whole organisms, with stems and roots that are often underground or creeping along the soil surface. With <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.09.003\">over 400 million years of evolutionary history</a>, ferns can teach us a lot about how the diversity of planet Earth came to be. Specifically, examining their inner anatomy can reveal some of the intricacies of evolution. </p>\n\n<h2>Sums of parts or an integrated whole?</h2>\n\n<p>When one structure cannot change without altering the other, researchers consider them constrained by each other. In biology, this linkage between traits is called a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/414425\">developmental constraint</a>. It explains the limits of what possible forms organisms can take. For instance, why there aren’t square trees or mammals with wheels.</p>\n\n<p>However, constraint does not always limit form. In my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.064\">recently published research</a>, I examined the fern vascular system to highlight how changes in one part of the organism can lead to changes in another, which can generate new forms. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a small, flat green circle with a brown outline, held between two fingers\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702694/original/file-20251116-66-q4j5b1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cross section of a stem of <em>Adiantum</em> in Costa Rica.

Among these believers was the 19th-century naturalist Georges Cuvier, who is lauded as the <a href=\"https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/10/proving-extinction-cuvier-and-the-elephantimorpha.html\">father of paleontology</a>. His argument against evolution was not exclusively based in faith but on a theory he called the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/tableaulment00cuvi/page/n9/mode/2up\">correlation of parts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Cuvier proposed that because each part of an organism is developmentally linked to every other part, changes in one part would result in changes to another. With this theory, he argued that a single tooth or bone could be used to reconstruct an entire organism. </p>\n\n<p>He used this theory to make a larger claim: If organisms are truly integrated wholes and not merely sums of individual parts, how could evolution fashion specific traits? Since changes in one part of an organism would necessitate changes in others, he argued, small modifications would require restructuring every other part. If the individual parts of an organism are all fully integrated, evolution of particular traits could not proceed. </p>\n\n<p>However, not all of the parts of an organism are <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/77447\">tethered together</a> so tightly. Indeed, some parts can evolve at different rates and under different selection pressures. This idea was solidified as the <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/adaptation/\">concept of quasi-independence</a> in the 1970s by evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin. The idea of organisms as collections of individually evolving parts remains today, influencing how researchers and students think about evolution.</p>\n\n<h2>Fern vasculature and the process of evolution</h2>\n\n<p>Ferns are one of four lineages of land plants that have <a href=\"https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/tracheophytes/\">vascular tissues</a> – specialized sets of tubes that move water and nutrients through their bodies. These tissues are composed of vascular bundles – clusters of cells that conduct water through the stem.  </p>\n\n<p>How <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2209\">vascular bundles are arranged in fern stems</a> varies substantially. Some have as many as three to eight or more vascular bundles scattered throughout their stem. Some are arranged symmetrically, while others such as the tobacco fern – <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em> – have bundles arranged in a whimsical, smiley-face pattern.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Cross-section of a roughly oblong stem with a smiley face shape towards one end\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702683/original/file-20251116-56-j641u7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cross section of the rhizome of <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em>, showing the smiley-face patterning of the vascular tissues.

I set out in my own research to test whether certain types of arrangements were more resistant to drought. But contrary to my initial hypotheses – and my desire for a relationship between form and function – the arrangement of vascular bundles in the stem <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17629\">did not seem to correlate with drought tolerance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This may sound counterintuitive, but it turns out the ability of a fern to move water through its body has more to do with the size and shape of the water-conducting cells rather than how they’re arranged as a whole in the stem. This finding is analogous to looking at road maps to understand traffic patterns. The patterning of roads on a map (how cells are arranged) may be less important in determining traffic patterns than the number and size of lanes (cell size and number). </p>\n\n<p>This observation hinted at something deeper about the evolution of the vascular systems of ferns. It sent me on a journey to uncover exactly what gave rise to the varying vascular patterns of ferns.</p>\n\n<h2>Simple observations and insights into evolution</h2>\n\n<p>I wondered how this variation in the number and arrangement of vascular bundles relates to leaf placement around the stem. So I quantified this variation in vascular patterning for 27 ferns representing roughly 30% of all fern species. </p>\n\n<p>I found a striking correlation between the number of rows of leaves and the number of vascular bundles within the stem. This relationship was almost 1-to-1 in some cases. For instance, if there were three rows of leaves along the stem, there were three vascular bundles in the stem. </p>\n\n<p>What’s more, how leaves were arranged around the stem determined the spatial arrangement of bundles. If the leaves were arranged spirally (on all sides of the stem), the vascular bundles were arranged in a radial pattern. If the leaves were shifted to the dorsal side of the stem, the smiley-face pattern emerged. </p>\n\n<p>Importantly, based on our understanding of plant development, there was a directionality here. Specifically, the placement of leaves determines the arrangement of bundles, not the other way around.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Microscopy images of cross-section of fern stems in different shapes, one a cluster of spots, another concentric circles and another three separate segments\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=248&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=248&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702897/original/file-20251117-56-9owrm0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=248&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Vascular architectures of three different ferns.

But it runs counter to how scientists have viewed the fern vascular system for over 100 years. Many studies on fern vascular patterning have tended to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.20185\">focus on individual parts of the plant</a>, removing vascular architecture from the context of the plant as a whole and viewing it as an independently evolving pattern.</p>\n\n<p>However, this new work suggests that the arrangement of vascular bundles in fern stems is not able to change in isolation. Rather, like Cuvier’s idealized organisms, vascular patterning is linked to and explicitly determined by the number and placement of leaves along the stem. This is not to say that vascular patterns could not be adaptive to environmental conditions, but it means that the handle of evolutionary change in the number and arrangement of vascular bundles is likely changes to leaf number and placement. </p>\n\n<h2>From parochial to existential</h2>\n\n<p>While this study on ferns and their vascular system may seem parochial, it speaks to the broader question of how variation – the fuel of evolution – arises, and how evolution can proceed.</p>\n\n<p>While not all parts of an organism are so tightly linked, considering the individual as a whole – or at least sets of parts as a unit – can help researchers better understand how, and if, observable patterns can evolve in isolation. This insight takes scientists one step closer to understanding the minutia of how evolution works to generate the immense biodiversity on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these processes is also important for industry. In agricultural settings, plant and animal breeders attempt to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00745\">increase one aspect of an organism without changing another</a>. By taking a holistic approach and understanding which parts of an organism are developmentally or genetically linked and which are more quasi-independent, breeders may be able to more effectively create organisms with desired traits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Slices of  fern stem on a table\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702695/original/file-20251116-56-3ln6df.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Researchers can learn much about evolution from the stems of <em>Mickelia nicotianifolia</em></span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jacob S.

Dark stars are not exactly stars, and they are certainly not dark.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the name captures the essence of this phenomenon. The “dark” in the name refers not to how bright these objects are, but to the process that makes them shine — driven by a mysterious substance called <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/dark-matter/\">dark matter</a>. The sheer size of these objects makes it difficult to classify them as stars. </p>\n\n<p>As a physicist, I’ve been fascinated by dark matter, and I’ve been trying to find a way to see its <a href=\"https://home.cern/science/physics/dark-matter\">traces using particle accelerators</a>. I’m curious whether dark stars could provide an alternative method to find dark matter. </p>\n\n<h2>What makes dark matter dark?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-the-mystery-substance-physics-still-cant-identify-that-makes-up-the-majority-of-our-universe-85808\">Dark matter</a>, which makes up approximately 27% of the universe but cannot be directly observed, is a key idea behind the phenomenon of dark stars. Astrophysicists have studied this mysterious substance for nearly a century, yet we haven’t seen any direct evidence of it besides its gravitational effects. So, what makes dark matter dark?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702373/original/file-20251113-66-n5qu4t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pie chart showing the composition of the universe.

For instance, the Moon is visible to the naked eye because it reflects sunlight. Atoms on the Moon’s surface absorb photons – the particles of light – sent from the Sun, causing electrons within atoms to move and send some of that light toward us.</p>\n\n<p>More advanced telescopes detect electromagnetic waves <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/electromagnetic-spectrum\">beyond the visible spectrum</a>, such as ultraviolet, infrared or radio waves. They use the same principle: Electrically charged components of atoms react to these electromagnetic waves. But how can they detect a substance – dark matter – that not only has no electric charge but also has no electrically charged components? </p>\n\n<p>Although scientists don’t know the exact nature of dark matter, many models suggest that it is made up of electrically neutral particles – those without an electric charge. This trait makes it impossible to observe dark matter in the same way that we observe ordinary matter. </p>\n\n<p>Dark matter is thought to be made of particles that are their own antiparticles. Antiparticles are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/antiparticle\">the “mirror” versions of particles</a>. They have the same mass but opposite electric charge and other properties. When a particle encounters its antiparticle, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/antimatter-we-cracked-how-gravity-affects-it-heres-what-it-means-for-our-understanding-of-the-universe-214285\">the two annihilate each other</a> in a burst of energy. </p>\n\n<p>If dark matter particles are their own antiparticles, they would annihilate upon colliding with each other, potentially releasing large amounts of energy. Scientists predict that this process plays a key role in the formation of dark stars, as long as the density of dark matter particles inside these stars is sufficiently high. The dark matter density determines how often dark matter particles encounter, and annihilate, each other. If the dark matter density inside dark stars is high, they would annihilate frequently.</p>\n\n<h2>What makes a dark star shine?</h2>\n\n<p>The concept of dark stars stems from a fundamental yet unresolved question in astrophysics: <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/star-formation\">How do stars form</a>? In the widely accepted view, clouds of primordial hydrogen and helium — the chemical elements formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang, approximately 13.8 billion years ago — collapsed under gravity. They heated up and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/nuclear-fusion/Fusion-reactions-in-stars\">initiated nuclear fusion</a>, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/elements-from-the-stars-the-unexpected-discovery-that-upended-astrophysics-66-years-ago-93916\">formed heavier elements</a> from the hydrogen and helium. This process led to the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-first-stars-may-not-have-been-as-uniformly-massive-as-astronomers-thought-263016\">formation of the first generation of stars</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two bright clouds of gas condensing around a small central region\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/686309/original/file-20250819-56-fthtyd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=769&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stars form when clouds of dust collapse inward and condense around a small, bright, dense core.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2219a/\">NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI, J.

But what if dark matter had a more active role in the process? That’s exactly the question a group of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.051101\">astrophysicists raised in 2008</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the dense environment of the early universe, dark matter particles would <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/measuring-helium-in-distant-galaxies-may-give-physicists-insight-into-why-the-universe-exists-205891\">collide with, and annihilate, each other</a>, releasing energy in the process. This energy could heat the hydrogen and helium gas, preventing it from further collapse and delaying, or even preventing, the typical ignition of nuclear fusion. </p>\n\n<p>The outcome would be a starlike object — but one powered by dark matter heating instead of fusion. Unlike regular stars, these dark stars might live much longer because they would continue to shine as long as they attracted dark matter. This trait would make them distinct from ordinary stars, as their cooler temperature would result in lower emissions of various particles.</p>\n\n<h2>Can we observe dark stars?</h2>\n\n<p>Several unique characteristics help astronomers <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/79/6/066902\">identify potential dark stars</a>. First, these objects must be very old. As the universe expands, the frequency of light coming from <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-doppler-0803\">objects far away from Earth decreases</a>, shifting toward the infrared end of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning it gets “redshifted.” The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-theory-predicts-physicists-are-searching-for-new-ideas-that-might-explain-the-mismatch-215414\">oldest objects appear the most redshifted</a> to observers.</p>\n\n<p>Since dark stars form from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-first-stars-may-not-have-been-as-uniformly-massive-as-astronomers-thought-263016\">primordial hydrogen and helium</a>, they are expected to contain little to no heavier elements, such as oxygen. They would be very large and cooler on the surface, yet highly luminous because their size — and the surface area emitting light — compensates for their lower surface brightness. </p>\n\n<p>They are also expected to be enormous, with radii of about tens of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomical-unit\">astronomical units</a> — a cosmic distance measurement equal to the average distance between Earth and the Sun. Some supermassive dark stars are theorized to reach masses of roughly 10,000 to 10 million times that of the Sun, depending on how much dark matter and hydrogen or helium gas they can accumulate during their growth. </p>\n\n<p>So, have astronomers observed dark stars? Possibly. Data from the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed some very high-redshift objects that seem brighter — and possibly more massive — than what scientists expect of typical early galaxies or stars. These results have led some researchers to propose that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.06101\">dark stars might explain these objects</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Artist's impression of the James Webb telescope, which has a hexagonal mirror made up of smaller hexagons, and sits on a rhombus-shaped spacecraft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702371/original/file-20251113-63-vn6nhv.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The James Webb Space Telescope, shown in this illustration, detects light coming from objects in the universe.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/jwst_in_space.jpg\">Northrup Grumman/NASA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In particular, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.06101\">a recent study analyzing James Webb Space Telescope data</a> identified three candidates consistent with supermassive dark star models. Researchers looked at how much helium these objects contained to identify them. Since it is dark matter annihilation that heats up those dark stars, rather than nuclear fusion turning helium into heavier elements, dark stars should have more helium.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers highlight that one of these objects indeed exhibited a potential “smoking gun” helium absorption signature: a far higher helium abundance than one would expect in typical early galaxies.</p>\n\n<h2>Dark stars may explain early black holes</h2>\n\n<p>What happens when a dark star runs out of dark matter? It depends on the size of the dark star. For the lightest dark stars, the depletion of dark matter would mean gravity compresses the remaining hydrogen, igniting nuclear fusion. In this case, the dark star would eventually become an ordinary star, so some stars may have begun as dark stars.</p>\n\n<p>Supermassive dark stars are even more intriguing. At the end of their lifespan, a dead supermassive dark star would collapse directly into a black hole. This black hole could start the formation of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-black-holes-bigger-than-others-an-astronomer-explains-how-these-celestial-vacuums-grow-217241\">supermassive black hole</a>, like the kind astronomers observe at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way.</p>\n\n<p>Dark stars might also explain how supermassive black holes formed in the early universe. They could shed light on some <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/chandra/nasa-telescopes-discover-record-breaking-black-hole/\">unique black holes observed by astronomers</a>. For example, a black hole in the galaxy UHZ-1 has a mass approaching 10 million solar masses, and is very old – it formed just 500 million years after the Big Bang. Traditional models struggle to explain how such massive black holes could form so quickly. </p>\n\n<p>The idea of dark stars is not universally accepted. These dark star candidates might still turn out just to be unusual galaxies. Some astrophysicists argue that matter accretion — a process in which <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/how-do-the-most-massive-stars-get-so-big\">massive objects pull in surrounding matter</a> — alone can produce massive stars, and that studies using observations from the James Webb telescope cannot distinguish between massive ordinary stars and less dense, cooler dark stars. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers emphasize that they will need more observational data and theoretical advancements to solve this mystery.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266971/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alexey A Petrov receives funding from the US Department of Energy. </span></em></p>",

However, if emissions continue rising and the atmosphere and oceans warm much more, that could cause substantial melting and much higher sea levels.</p>\n\n<p>Our research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64438-3\">high emissions pose risks</a> not just to the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is already contributing to sea-level rise, but also for the much larger and <a href=\"https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/antarctica-2/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-2/marine-ice-sheets/\">more stable</a> East Antarctic ice sheet. </p>\n\n<p>It also shows how different regions of the world will experience different levels of sea-level rise as Antarctica melts.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding sea-level change</h2>\n\n<p>If sea levels rose like the water in a bathtub, then as ice sheets melt, the ocean would rise by the same amount everywhere. But that isn’t what happens.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, many places experience higher regional sea-level rise than the global average, while places close to the ice sheet can even see sea levels drop. The main reason has to do with gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ice sheets are massive, and that mass creates a strong gravitational pull that attracts the surrounding ocean water toward them, similar to how the gravitational <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides\">pull between Earth and the Moon affects the tides</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the ice sheet shrinks, its gravitational <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nHr7_qsBLOo?si=Hr-tDxt02j4nA54S\">pull on the ocean declines</a>, leading to sea levels falling in regions close to the ice sheet coast and rising farther away. But sea-level changes are not only a function of distance from the melting ice sheet. This ice loss also changes how the planet rotates. The rotation axis is pulled toward that missing ice mass, which in turn redistributes water around the globe. </p>\n\n<h2>2 factors that can slow melting</h2>\n\n<p>As the massive ice sheet melts, the solid Earth beneath it rebounds.</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the bedrock of Antarctica is Earth’s mantle, which flows slowly like maple syrup. The more the ice sheet melts, the less it presses down on the solid Earth. With less weight on it, <a href=\"https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/comic-corner/isostatic-rebound/\">the bedrock can rebound</a>. This can lift parts of the ice sheet out of contact with warming ocean waters, slowing the rate of melting. This happens quicker in places where the mantle flows faster, such as underneath the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>\n\n<p>This rebound effect <a href=\"https://blog.ucs.org/shaina-sadai/our-new-research-says-the-solid-earth-can-help-protect-the-antarctic-ice-sheet-only-if-we-cut-emissions-now/\">could help preserve</a> the ice sheet – if global greenhouse gas emissions are kept low.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHr7_qsBLOo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA explains how land rebounds when ice sheets melts. NASA via Virtual Palaeosciences.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Another factor that can slow melting might seem counterintuitive.</p>\n\n<p>While Antarctic meltwater drives rising sea levels, models show it also delays greenhouse gas-induced warming. That’s because icy meltwater from Antarctica reduces ocean surface temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical Pacific, trapping heat in the deep ocean and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64438-3\">slowing the rise of global average air temperature</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But as melting occurs, even if it slows, sea levels rise.</p>\n\n<h2>Mapping our sea-level results</h2>\n\n<p>We combined computer models that simulate these and other behaviors of the Antarctic ice sheet, solid Earth and climate to understand what could happen to sea level around the world as global temperatures rise and ice melts. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in a moderate scenario in which the world <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0151-4\">reduces greenhouse gas emissions</a>, though not enough to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) in 2100, we found the average sea-level rise from Antarctic ice melt would be about 4 inches (0.1  meters) by 2100. By 2200, it would be more than 3.3 feet (1  meter). </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is only sea-level rise caused by Antarctic melt. The Greenland ice sheet and thermal expansion of seawater as the oceans warm will also raise sea levels. Current estimates suggest that <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter13_FINAL.pdf\">total average sea-level rise</a> – including Greenland and thermal expansion – would be 1 to 2 feet (0.32 to 0.63 meters) by 2100 under the same scenario.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two maps of the earth showing differing sea level rise\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=706&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702395/original/file-20251114-56-fxrqoi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=887&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Models show Antarctica’s contribution to sea-level rise in 2200 under medium (top) and high (bottom) emissions.

This exercise, however, highlights the serious consequences of high emissions and underscores the importance of reducing emissions.</p>\n\n<h2>The takeaway</h2>\n\n<p>These impacts have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF002940\">implications for climate justice</a>, particularly for island nations that have done little to contribute to climate change yet already experience the devastating impacts of sea-level rise.</p>\n\n<p>Many island nations are already losing land to sea-level rise, and they have been <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154911\">leading global efforts</a> to minimize temperature rise.

We also measured types of demeaning treatment, which included bullying, harassment and condescending behavior. And we looked at physical violence.</p>\n\n<p>Higher levels of workplace mistreatment were related to greater numbers of poor mental health days. The child care staff we surveyed reported an average of seven poor mental health days in the month prior to completing the survey. </p>\n\n<h2>Mistreatment in early childhood education</h2>\n\n<p>The early child care workforce also reports <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-020-01143-4\">higher rates of depression than the national workforce</a>.</p>\n\n<p>High stress of educators and staff even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568543.2019.1705446\">pushes some workers out of the profession</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-024-01677-x\">Working conditions</a> matter, too, with early child care workers reporting substantial <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-020-01124-7\">physical and psychological workplace challenges</a>, such as lifting and carrying children, as well as managing a wide range of ages and capabilities among children in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>Our survey also revealed that 1 in 4 early child care staff experienced condescending or demeaning treatment by colleagues or superiors in the past 12 months. This was the most common type of workplace mistreatment.</p>\n\n<p>In early child care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08856257.2015.1087127\">teamwork</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1836939120979064\">collegiality</a> are integral and are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorados-early-childhood-education-workers-face-burnout-and-health-disparities-but-a-wellness-campaign-could-help-250880\">linked to educator well-being</a>.

Discrimination between age groups <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-010-9172-7\">affects trust</a> and can reduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/JMP-06-2013-0179\">employee engagement</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Mistreatment of early child care workers can take several forms that happen at the same time. For example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/4/655/3958244\">age discrimination</a> can occur in either direction. Younger staff may be viewed by older colleagues as less experienced, less committed or less capable than more experienced colleagues. Older colleagues may be perceived to be less creative or less willing to adapt to new strategies and practices. </p>\n\n<p>Yet overall, younger workers seemed to be struggling more. Workers under 35 reported an average of eight to nine poor mental health days in a 30-day window; older workers reported an average of 5.6. </p>\n\n<h2>Improving staff well-being</h2>\n\n<p>Our study indicates a need for both societal and organizational change to prevent mistreatment of early child care staff, which can improve worker well-being and lead to better care for young children. </p>\n\n<p>At a societal level, it is important to acknowledge the integral role of the early child care workforce and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-typical-child-care-worker-in-the-us-earns-less-than-12-an-hour-160146\">compensate these workers at a level commensurate</a> with their importance. In 2023, the average U.S. preschool teacher earned an <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm#tab-5\">annual income</a> of $37,120 compared to the $63,680 <a href=\"https://careers.usnews.com/best-jobs/elementary-school-teacher/salary\">annual income of elementary school teachers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/distillation/the-case-for-better-compensation-of-early-educators/\">Adequate pay</a> and appreciation <a href=\"https://teachingstrategies.com/blog/teacher-retention-strategies-the-power-of-appreciation/\">can reduce turnover</a>. Rates of turnover are <a href=\"https://bellpolicy.org/early-childhood-education-workforce/\">four times higher among early child care educators</a> than elementary school teachers.</p>\n\n<p>“Turnover has a lot to do with pay, unfortunately, and we don’t get paid a whole lot of money,” one educator said. “And … I don’t think I’ve always felt valued in the position I’m in.” </p>\n\n<p>At an organizational level, leaders can implement health-centered policies and offer managerial training on how to build supportive teams. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13241-6\">Total Worker Health interventions</a> may also help to guide needed policy changes with input from staff. These interventions are holistic programs that focus on both the safety and well-being of workers and include elements such as environmental and social supports. They are <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55995-001.html\">shown to improve worker well-being</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One initiative <a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/journal/nurturing-the-nurturer-elevating-educator-well-being-and-competencies-through-comprehensive-wellness-programs/\">compared wellness intervention models</a> across six Early Head Start and Head Start networks nationally to address the comprehensive well-being in staff. Direct outcomes of the programs included workplace and organizational culture improvements, as well as higher staff well-being. </p>\n\n<p>We designed the <a href=\"https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/research-and-practice/centers-programs/rmprc/research-and-practice/ongoing-programs-and-projects/well-project\">WELL Program</a>, which has successfully been implemented at five Colorado-based Head Start networks. The program includes <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colorados-early-childhood-education-workers-face-burnout-and-health-disparities-but-a-wellness-campaign-could-help-250880\">training to promote better sleep</a> and mindfulness. </p>\n\n<p>“WELL help(ed) people keep going every day and deal with their stress in a healthy way so it didn’t come out in the classroom, or come out against kiddos that are tough,” one participant said.</p>\n\n<p>Our study also suggests there may be generational differences in workplace communication and a varied understanding of what it is to be mistreated. Additional research on these differences may help us to address causes of mistreatment and find solutions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264666/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charlotte Farewell receives funding from the Administration for Children and Families.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jini Puma receives funding from the Administration for Children and Families. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kyla Hagan-Haynes and Virginia McCarthy do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In psychology, this idea is described as “intrinsic motivation” – working because you find the work itself satisfying. People who are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-6566(85)90023-6\">intrinsically motivated</a> tend to experience <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.66.5.950\">genuine enjoyment and curiosity in what they do</a>, relishing opportunities to learn or master challenges for their own sake. Research has long shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.48\">intrinsic motivation enhances performance</a>, persistence and creativity at work.</p>\n\n<p>Yet my and my co-authors’ <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=dSvUp0wAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">recent research</a> suggests that this seemingly innocent idea of loving your work can take on a moral edge. Increasingly, people seem to judge both themselves <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-trouble-with-passion/paper\">and others</a> according to whether they are <a href=\"https://careers.usnews.com/advice/articles/231020careers.whydoyouwanttoworkhere\">intrinsically motivated</a>. What used to be a personal preference has, for many, become a moral imperative: You should love your work, and it is somehow wrong if you don’t. </p>\n\n<h2>Moralizing motivation</h2>\n\n<p>When a neutral preference <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00139\">becomes charged with moral meaning</a>, social scientists call it “moralization.” For example, someone might initially choose vegetarianism for their own health reasons but come to view it as the right thing to do – and judge others accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">moralization of intrinsic motivation</a> follows a similar logic. People work for many reasons: passion, duty, family, security or social status. But once intrinsic motivation becomes moralized, loving what you do is seen as not only enjoyable but virtuous. Working for money, prestige or family obligation starts to look less admirable, even suspect.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2023 study, fellow business researchers <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/julia-lee-cunningham\">Julia Lee Cunningham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1175257\">Jon M. Jachimowicz</a> and I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2020.1761\">surveyed over 1,200 employees</a>, asking whether they thought working for personal enjoyment was virtuous.</p>\n\n<p>People who did, we found, tended to believe everyone else should be intrinsically motivated, too. They were also more likely to see other motives, such as working for pay or recognition, as morally inferior. They tended to agree, for example, that “you are morally obligated to love the work itself more than you love the rewards and perks.”  </p>\n\n<p>These employees had internalized the idea that you work either for love or money – even though most people, in reality, do both.</p>\n\n<h2>Costs for you</h2>\n\n<p>At first glance, treating love for work as a virtue seems to offer nothing but benefits. If a job’s mission or day-to-day tasks are personally meaningful, you may persist through challenges, because quitting could feel like betraying an ideal.</p>\n\n<p>But this virtue <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dowhatyouloveoth0000toku\">can also backfire</a>. When intrinsic motivation becomes a moral duty rather than a joy, you may feel guilty for not constantly loving your work. Emotions that are normal in any job, such as boredom, fatigue or disengagement, can prompt feelings of moral failure and self-blame. Over time, this pressure can <a href=\"https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/\">contribute to burnout</a> if you stay in unsustainable roles out of guilt. </p>\n\n<p>By idealizing your “dream job” when you’re applying, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211068660\">you may overlook security</a>, stability and other important life needs – risking financial strain and underusing your talents. This unrealistic standard could also lead you to leave a job too soon when reality disappoints or initial passion fades.</p>\n\n<h2>Costs for a company</h2>\n\n<p>Moralizing intrinsic motivation doesn’t stop at the self; it also reshapes how we judge others. People who moralize intrinsic motivation often expect it from everyone else. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2020.1761\">a study of nearly 800 employees</a> across 185 teams, we found that employees who moralized intrinsic motivation were more generous toward teammates they perceived as loving their work. However, they were less willing to help out colleagues they considered less passionate. In other words, moralizing intrinsic motivation can make employees “discerning saints” – good to some, but selectively so.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man and woman seated at an office table high-five each other in a room whose glass walls are covered with print-outs and sticky notes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702652/original/file-20251116-56-1aqcsp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Seeing intrinsic motivation as a virtue affects how people view colleagues, too.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/shot-of-two-young-designers-giving-each-other-a-royalty-free-image/1367764265?phrase=office%20passion&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">Moyo Studio/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This dynamic can create problems for work teams. Leaders who strongly moralize intrinsic motivation may adopt leadership styles aimed at igniting passion in their teams – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032516-113108\">emphasizing workers’ autonomy</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>While inspiring on the surface, this approach can alienate employees who work for more pragmatic reasons. Over time, I would argue, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">this can breed tension and conflict</a>, as some team members are celebrated as “true believers” and others are quietly marginalized. Expressing love for one’s work becomes a kind of commodity – one more way to get ahead.</p>\n\n<h2>Embracing many motives</h2>\n\n<p>People all around the world experience intrinsic motivation. But if that feeling is universal, its moralization is not. </p>\n\n<p>My current research with <a href=\"https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/laura-sonday/\">management researcher Laura Sonday</a> suggests that moralizing intrinsic motivation is more pronounced in some cultures than in others. Where work is viewed as a means of service, duty or balance, rather than a source of personal fulfillment, loving one’s job may be appreciated but not <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2021.0467\">treated as a moral expectation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would urge office leaders to recognize the double-edged nature of moralizing intrinsic motivation. Expressing genuine love for work can inspire others, but enforcing it as a moral norm can silence or shame those with different values or priorities. Leaders should be careful not to equate enthusiasm with virtue, or assume that passion always signals integrity or competence.</p>\n\n<p>For employees, it may be worth reflecting on how we talk about our own motivation. Loving one’s work is wonderful, but it’s also perfectly human to value stability, recognition or family needs. In a culture where “do what you love” has become a moral commandment, remembering that it’s not the be-all, end-all reason to work may be the most moral stance of all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266983/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mijeong Kwon does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Why doesn’t someone help them? What can I do about this?</p>\n\n<p>The answers to these questions are complex. However, a significant body of research suggests that there is a <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000001219\">highly effective solution</a> for many individuals who experience homelessness. It is called supportive housing. </p>\n\n<p>Supportive housing programs combine a housing subsidy – financial assistance that helps make housing affordable even for those with very low incomes – with wraparound supportive services that help a person remain stably housed. Supportive services often include case management, occupational therapy and mental health and addiction treatment. These programs have <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/media/20230331105222/OHS_2023Report_Web_SinglePages.pdf\">helped thousands of Philadelphians</a> end their experiences of homelessness.  </p>\n\n<p>As a researcher and former social worker, I have spent much of the past decade working in and studying homeless services in Philadelphia. For my <a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/199333\">dissertation research</a>, I conducted hundreds of hours of ethnographic fieldwork at a soup kitchen and outreach center in the city between 2022 and 2024. I interviewed 75 homeless services workers, volunteers and people who were experiencing or had experienced homelessness. I also analyzed hundreds of pages of policy documents.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that while the city has succeeded in centralizing services to support unhoused people, there remain major bureaucratic challenges exacerbated by insufficient funding and a shortage of supportive housing. These challenges impact both people seeking supportive housing and front-line workers trying to help them. </p>\n\n<h2>Khalil’s story</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the case of Khalil, a 48-year-old from West Philly who became homeless during the pandemic. (As for all the interviewees’ names used in this article, Khalil is a pseudonym I’m using to protect his privacy.) Khalil told me that he lost his job as an IT technician at Verizon, where he had worked for nine years. Sleeping outside and unable to afford life-sustaining kidney medication, he said, his physical and mental health spiraled. </p>\n\n<p>A supportive housing program changed that, providing him with a stable and affordable place to live, while social workers helped him enroll in Medicaid and connect with a community health clinic. This support, Khalil explained, allowed him to “transition back into residential living and back into employment and back into being a working member of society.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite the efficacy of supportive housing, cities do not receive sufficient federal funding to provide this service to all residents who are eligible. As a result, the need for these housing programs vastly outstrips the supply. </p>\n\n<p>So how do officials in Philadelphia decide who will continue to sleep on the street or in a shelter, and who can move into a supportive housing facility with a warm bed and access to valuable wraparound services?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the city determines who gets housing</h2>\n\n<p>Like other localities, Philadelphia uses a <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-homeless-services/documents/standards-policies-and-forms/#/?table=Coordinated%20Entry%20and%20Assessment-Based%20Housing%20Referral%20System%20(CEA-BHRS)\">Coordinated Entry System</a>. CES is a form of automated bureaucracy that combines several different algorithms and administrative processes with the goal of helping officials and social service workers allocate resources fairly and efficiently.  </p>\n\n<p>CES is intended to help workers identify which people experiencing homelessness are in greatest need of aid. These systems work by combining a central pool of resources like housing programs and a central list of people seeking help. Unhoused people are scored using a vulnerability assessment tool, and those that score highest are matched to an opening in a supportive housing program.</p>\n\n<p>Because most of these systems are premised on targeting resources to the most vulnerable people, defining and gauging vulnerability becomes fraught with tension. After all, vulnerability is inherently subjective, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306628\">there is no universally agreed-upon best way to measure it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These systems will soon come under even greater pressure as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development prepares to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/trump-homeless-funding.html\">slash funding for supportive housing programs</a>. As many as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/trump-cuts-homeless-housing-program-00650758\">170,000 people nationwide</a> who were previously homeless will be at risk of returning to the streets once these funding changes are implemented.</p>\n\n<h2>CES has benefits and drawbacks</h2>\n\n<p>Coordinated entry has made real progress on several long-standing challenges for Philadelphia’s homeless services system. Chief among these is centralization. </p>\n\n<p>Most resources available for people experiencing homelessness are administered by nonprofit social services organizations. Prior to CES, a person seeking assistance would separately apply to various nonprofits and put their name on multiple waiting lists. </p>\n\n<p>CES centralizes resources into a common pool, accessed through the vulnerability assessment process. As one administrator with the city’s Office of Homeless Services told me, this arrangement is “immensely more supportive and fair” than the scattered process that came before. For example, individual nonprofit providers are less able to earmark resources for clients they already work with.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are downsides to Philadelphia’s approach to CES. </p>\n\n<p>Vulnerability assessments, like those used in Philadelphia, have been criticized for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10530789.2020.1852502\">failing to capture a full picture</a> of a person’s plight. Assessments involve asking unhoused people a series of yes or no questions about their housing, health and financial history, and generate a vulnerability score based on the responses. A person who has a relatively mild experience with several different risk factors can end up with a much higher score than a person with an extremely serious experience with just a few.</p>\n\n<p>And similar to other automated assessments, <a href=\"https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/sites/stpp/files/2023-05/Risk%20Assessment%20Policy%20Brief%20Final%205.2.23_0.pdf\">such as in the criminal legal system</a>, they have the potential to <a href=\"https://homelesshub.ca/resource/coordinated-entry-systems-racial-equity-analysis-assessment-data/\">introduce racial bias into</a> allocation outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the way CES works is, by design, hidden from the people it impacts most. The ambiguity is intended to prevent people from gaming the system, but it also creates confusion for those living in shelters and on the street. Some seeking aid may hide evidence of their vulnerability, such as addiction, out of fear it will disqualify them from housing. Others may amplify their vulnerability in an effort to improve their odds of receiving help. </p>\n\n<p>The result is a perception among people experiencing homelessness that the system is unfair. </p>\n\n<p>As Andre, a 60-year-old who had been sleeping in shelters off and on for nearly a decade, told me, a person who “goes in there and tells the absolute truth, they’re put on the back burner.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Person sleeps on chairs with wheelchair nearby\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703718/original/file-20251120-56-p49xkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A person sleeps on a bench in the Philadelphia International Airport.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/VirusOutbreak-Pennsylvania-AirportHomeless/17f62d3dbffa45ffa2fe6107d96a422a/photo\">AP Photo/Matt Rourke</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>‘You’ve got to have a record of being homeless’</h2>\n\n<p>Leon, a 25-year-old from North Philadelphia, told me as we chatted over coffee that in order to be prioritized through CES, “You’ve got to have a record of being homeless.” </p>\n\n<p>But generating such a paper trail can be difficult. A city database tracks shelter stays that can serve as proof of homelessness, but not all shelters participate. And for those sleeping outside, like Leon, proof depends on regular interactions with outreach workers, which requires being in the right place at the right time.</p>\n\n<p>If an unhoused person cannot prove the length of their time on the street, or provide documentation of a mental health diagnosis, they may be deprioritized through CES, even if they are highly vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>For all its advantages, CES in Philly is not designed to take into account the input of unhoused people themselves. In the words of Richie, a 32-year-old who was seeking housing for himself and his pregnant wife, “There is no voice for homeless people … because homeless people don’t have a voice.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, the city has lowered barriers to participating in CES. For example, the city has launched a pilot program involving <a href=\"https://phlcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/City-Council-FY24-Budget-Questions_OHS.pdf\">mobile assessors</a> who can complete assessments in different locations beyond city shelters, such as at soup kitchens, to meet unhoused people where they are. </p>\n\n<h2>3 ways to improve the system</h2>\n\n<p>Here are three concrete ways the city could reduce more of the bureaucratic hurdles to supportive housing. </p>\n\n<p>First, the city could expand pathways to supportive housing through a model called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306628\">multiprinciple allocation</a>. This approach combines different methods for determining who gets housing. Some subsidies could be allocated through new vulnerability assessments that are better vetted for bias, while others are distributed based on length of homelessness or a lottery system. This could bolster fairness by ensuring that people whose vulnerability is not picked up through the assessment tool could still have a shot at aid. </p>\n\n<p>Second, the city could provide opportunities for unhoused people and front-line workers to attest to vulnerability and experiences of homelessness in their own words – allowing someone to say, “I am struggling with housing for reasons that the assessment did not cover.” </p>\n\n<p>And third, Philadelphia could reduce the degree of automation in the CES matching process. As things stand, people with high scores are mechanically matched to open programs, even if that program is a poor fit for the individual person. Giving staff and unhoused people more agency in making housing matches could produce better outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>No amount of tinkering with CES can address the fundamental resource constraints that shape the fight against homelessness in Philadelphia. Simply put, Philadelphia lacks sufficient funding for housing the most vulnerable. But thoughtful changes to CES could make the response to homelessness more effective, compassionate and fair. </p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266563/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Pelle G.

Unlike traditional academic graduate programs, which are often centered on research and scholarship, these professionally oriented degrees are designed primarily for workforce advancement and typically charge much higher tuition.</p>\n\n<p>These programs are often expensive for students and are sometimes described as <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/masters-programs-are-cash-cows-for-universities-do-they-pay-off-for-students/\">cash-cow</a> degrees for colleges and universities, because the tuition revenue far exceeds the instructional costs.</p>\n\n<p>Some universities and colleges also leverage their brands to offer online, executive or certificate-based versions of these programs, attracting many students from the U.S. and abroad who pay the full tuition. This <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/how-microcredentials-are-revolutionizing-the-higher-education-business-model\">steady revenue</a> helps universities subsidize tuition for other students who cannot pay the full rate, among other things. </p>\n\n<p>Yet a quiet tension underlies this evolution in higher education – the widening divide between practical, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/masters-programs-are-cash-cows-for-universities-do-they-pay-off-for-students/\">technical training and a comprehensive education</a> that perhaps is more likely to encourage students to inquire, reflect and innovate as they learn. </p>\n\n<h2>An overlooked factor</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.texaseducationinfo.org/Home/Topic/employment_and_earnings_by_education?\">Some states, including Texas</a>, track salary data for graduates of every program to measure worth through short-term earnings. This approach may strike many students and their families as useful, but I believe it overlooks a part of what makes higher education valuable. </p>\n\n<p>A healthy higher education system depends not only on producing employable graduates but also on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023119859708\">cultivating citizens</a> and leaders who can interpret uncertainty, question assumptions and <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/policy-statements/defense-knowledge-and-higher-education\">connect ideas</a> across disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>When assessing disciplines such as English, philosophy, history and world languages, I think that we should acknowledge their contributions to critical thought, communication and ethical reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>These academic disciplines encourage students to synthesize ideas, construct arguments and engage in meaningful debate. Some law schools often draw their <a href=\"https://nationaljurist.com/classics-philosophy-majors-do-best-when-it-comes-getting-law-school/\">strongest students</a> from <a href=\"https://fgcu360.com/2025/01/03/why-nothing-matters-philosophy-as-a-stepping-stone-to-law/\">these backgrounds</a> because they nurture analytical and rhetorical skills essential for navigating complex civic and legal issues.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, poets and writers have often been among the first to be <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/pen-america-writers-gaza-israel/678272/\">silenced by authoritarian regimes</a>. It’s a reminder of the societal power of inquiry and expression that I believe higher education should protect.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of young people wear white jackets and stand around a dummy dressed with a pink blanket over it in a hospital bed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703911/original/file-20251121-79-8evpmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Undergraduate students who want to become doctors or work in other specialized fields are often encouraged to take only classes that connect with their long-term career trajectory.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nursing-school-students-work-in-the-new-simulation-lab-in-news-photo/2218446333?adppopup=true\">Glenn Beil/Florida A&amp;M University via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why students stay on narrow professional paths</h2>\n\n<p>Students entering college today face significant pressure to choose what they might see as safe majors that will result in a well-paying career. For aspiring physicians and engineers, the path is often <a href=\"https://careerservices.upenn.edu/academic-planning-for-medical-school/\">scripted early</a> by <a href=\"https://hms.harvard.edu/education-admissions/md-program/admissions/preparing-apply/prerequisite-courses\">steering them toward</a> physical and biosciences. High test scores, internships and other stepping stones are treated as nonnegotiable. Parents and peers can reinforce this mindset. </p>\n\n<p>Most colleges and universities do not reward a future medical student who wants to major in comparative literature, or an engineering student who is spending time on philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>Students’ majors also typically place course requirements on them, in addition to a school’s general course requirements. This often does not leave a lot of room for students to experiment with different classes, especially if they are pursuing vocationally focused majors, such as engineering. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, I’ve seen many students trade curiosity for credentialing, believing that professional identity must come before intellectual exploration.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dsri.uiowa.edu/people/daniel-mcgehee\">As someone who began</a> my education in psychology and later transitioned into engineering, I have seen how different intellectual traditions approach the same human questions. Psychology teaches people to observe behavior and design experiments. Engineering trains students to model systems and optimize performance.</p>\n\n<p>When combined, they help reveal how humans interact with technology and how technological solutions reshape human behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, these are questions neither field can answer alone.</p>\n\n<h2>Initiative is the missing ingredient</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most important and often overlooked ingredients in thriving high tech, medical and business environments is initiative. I believe students in the humanities routinely practice taking initiative by framing questions, interpreting incomplete information and proposing original arguments. These skills are crucial for scientific or business innovation, but they are often not emphasized in structured science, technology, engineering and mathematics – or STEM – coursework.  </p>\n\n<p>Initiative involves the willingness to move first and to see around corners, defining the next what-if, rallying others and building something meaningful even when the path is uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>To help my engineering students practice taking initiative, I often give them deliberately vague instructions – something they rarely experience in their coursework. Many students, even highly capable ones, hesitate to take initiative because their schooling experience has largely rewarded caution and compliance over exploration. They wait for clarity or for permission – not because they lack ability, but because they are afraid to be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in business, research labs, design studios, hospitals and engineering firms, initiative is the quality employers most urgently need and cannot easily teach. Broader educational approaches help cultivate this confidence by encouraging students to interpret ambiguity rather than avoid it. </p>\n\n<h2>How teaching can evolve</h2>\n\n<p>Helping all students develop a sense of initiative and innovation requires university leaders to rethink what success looks like.</p>\n\n<p>Universities can begin with achievable steps, such as rewarding cross-disciplinary teaching and joint appointments in promotion and tenure criteria.</p>\n\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://dsri.uiowa.edu/\">University of Iowa’s Driving Safety Research Institute</a>, where our teams blend engineering, medicine, public health and psychology, students quickly learn that a safe automated vehicle is not just a technical system but also a behavioral one. Understanding how human drivers respond to automation is as important as the algorithms that govern the vehicle. </p>\n\n<p>Other institutions are modeling this approach of integrating social, behavioral and physical sciences.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.olin.edu/\">Olin College of Engineering</a>, a school in Needham, Massachusetts, builds every project around both technical feasibility and human context. Courses are often co-taught by humanities and engineering professors, and projects require students to articulate not only what they built but why it matters.</p>\n\n<p>Still, integrating liberal and technical education is difficult in practice. Professional curricula often overflow with accreditation requirements. Faculty incentives reward specialization more than collaboration. Students and parents, <a href=\"https://clp.law.harvard.edu/knowledge-hub/magazine/issues/student-debt/debt-takes-a-toll/\">anxious about debt</a> and job security, hesitate to spend credits outside of a student’s major. </p>\n\n<h2>Rethinking what success means</h2>\n\n<p>I believe that higher education’s purpose is not to produce uniform workers but adaptable thinkers.</p>\n\n<p>It might not be productive to center conversations about defending the liberal arts or glorifying STEM. Rather, I think that people’s focus should be on recognizing that each field is incomplete without the other.</p>\n\n<p>Education for a complex world must cultivate depth, initiative and perspective. When students connect disciplines, question assumptions and act with purpose, they are prepared not only for their first job but for a lifetime of learning and leadership.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270025/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Daniel V.
