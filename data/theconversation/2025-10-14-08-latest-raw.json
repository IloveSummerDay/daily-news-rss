Callais</a>, with major implications for the Voting Rights Act, racial representation and Democratic Party power in congress.</p>\n\n<p>The central question in the case is to what extent race can, or must, be used when congressional districts are redrawn. Plaintiffs are challenging whether the longstanding interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, which requires protection of minority voting power in redistricting, violates the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection\">Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution</a>, which guarantees that individuals should be treated the same by the law. </p>\n\n<p>In short, the plaintiffs argue that the state of Louisiana’s use of race to make a second Black-majority district is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/supreme-court-louisiana-redistricting-voting-rights-act\">second time</a> that the court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-in-pivotal-case-on-the-voting-rights-act/\">after no decision was reached last term</a>. From my perspective as a <a href=\"https://www.simmons.edu/people/sam-hayes\">scholar of U.S. federal courts and electoral systems</a>, this case represents the collision of decades of Supreme Court decisions on race, redistricting and the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<h2>Long legal battle</h2>\n\n<p>To understand the stakes of the current case, it’s important to know what the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47520\">Voting Rights Act</a> does. Initially passed in 1965, the act helped end decades of racially discriminatory voting laws by providing federal enforcement of voting rights. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/election-law-explainers/section-2-of-the-voting-rights-act-vote-dilution-and-vote-deprivation/\">forbids discrimination by states</a> in relation to voting rights and has been used for decades to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>The current case has its roots in the <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census\">redistricting of Louisiana’s congressional districts</a> following the 2020 Census. States are required to redraw districts each decade based on new population data. Louisiana lawmakers redrew the state’s six congressional districts without major changes in 2022.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Police smashing marchers on a street with billy clubs.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695691/original/file-20251010-74-yozti2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">State troopers in Selma, Ala., swing billy clubs on March 7, 1965, to break up a march by advocates for Black Americans’ voting rights.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Voting%20Rights%20Act%201965&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Soon after the state redistricted, a group of Black voters challenged the map in federal court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the new map was discriminatory because the voting power of Black citizens in the state was being illegally diluted. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-race-and-ethnicity-legislature-census-2020-baton-rouge-5e4b92df3831434909bf37d95abd2151\">The state’s population was 31% Black</a>, but only one of the six districts featured a majority-Black population.</p>\n\n<p>The federal courts in 2022 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-john-bel-edwards-louisiana-baton-rouge-congress-78cae5a254ffa6bcb460139600e60099\">sided with the plaintiffs’ claim</a> that the plan did violate the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state legislature to redraw the congressional plan with a second Black-majority district.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://redistricting.lls.edu/wp-content/uploads/la-2020-robinson-220606-order.pdf\">judges relied on an interpretation of Section 2</a> of the Voting Rights Act from a 1986 Supreme Court decision in the <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968\">case known as Thornburg v. Gingles</a>. Under this interpretation, Section 2’s nondiscrimination requirement means that congressional districts must be drawn in a way that allows large, politically cohesive and compact racial minorities to be able to elect representatives of their choice. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-in-unconstitutional-districts-us-supreme-court-upended-decades-of-precedent-in-2022-by-allowing-voters-to-vote-with-gerrymandered-maps-instead-of-fixing-the-congressional-districts-first-227124\">a similar racial gerrymandering case in Alabama</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Louisiana lawmakers redraw districts</h2>\n\n<p>Following the court order, the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/03/court-weighs-louisiana-redistricting-with-second-majority-black-district/\">Louisiana state legislature passed Senate Bill 8</a> in January 2024, redrawing the congressional map and creating two districts where Black voters composed a substantial portion of the electorate in compliance with the Gingles ruling. This map was used in <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_elections,_2024\">the 2024 congressional election</a> and both Black-majority districts elected Democrats, while the other four districts elected Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>These new congressional districts from Senate Bill 8 were challenged by a group of white voters in 2024 in a set of cases that became <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-109_l53m.pdf\">Louisiana v. Callais</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that the Louisiana legislature’s drawing of districts based on race in Senate Bill 8 was in violation of the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/\">14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause</a>, which requires equal treatment of individuals by the government, and the 15th Amendment, <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv\">which forbids denying the right to vote based on race</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the plaintiffs claimed that the courts’ interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional and that the use of race to create a majority-minority district is itself discriminatory. Similar arguments about the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause were also the basis of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">striking down race-based affirmative action in college admissions</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, a three-judge district court sided with the white plaintiffs in Louisiana v. Callais, with a 2-1 decision. The Black plaintiffs <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370938/20250827153950778_24-109%2024-110%20Louisiana%20v%20Callais%20et%20al%20Supplemental%20Brief%20for%20Robinson%20Defendants.pdf?inline=1\">from the original case</a>, and the state of Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-109/370895/20250827134212077_Callais%20-%20Supplemental%20Opening%20Merits%20Brief.pdf?inline=1\">appealed the case to the Supreme Court</a>.

Callais, deciding that Louisiana’s congressional districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, it will have substantial impacts on minority representation. The decision would upend decades of precedent for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">For 39 years</a>, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has required redistricting institutions to consider racial and ethnic minority representation when devising congressional districts. <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Majority-minority_districts\">Majority-minority districting</a> is required when a state has large, compact and cohesive minority communities. Historically, some states have redistricted minority communities in ways that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act\">dilute their voting power, such as “cracking”</a> a community into multiple districts where they compose a small percentage of the electorate. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 also provides voters and residents with a legal tool that has been used to challenge districts as discriminatory. Many voters and groups have used Section 2 successfully to challenge redistricting plans. </p>\n\n<p>Section 2 has been the main legal tool for challenging racial discrimination in redistricting for the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively ended the other major component of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, which required certain states to have <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/shelby-county-v-holder\">changes to their elections laws approved by the federal government</a>, including redistricting. </p>\n\n<p>If the court overrules the current interpretation of Section 2, it would limit the legality of using race in redistricting, end requirements for majority-minority districts and eliminate the most common way to challenge discriminatory districting.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, because of the strong relationship between many <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/\">minority communities and the Democratic party</a>, the court’s decision has major implications for partisan control of the House of Representatives. </p>\n\n<p>If Section 2 no longer required majority-minority districts, then Republicans could use the ruling to redraw congressional districts across the country to benefit their party. Politico reported that Democrats could <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/republicans-scotus-vra-00597212\">lose as many as 19 House seats</a> if the Supreme Court sides with the lower court. </p>\n\n<p>Recent Supreme Court precedent gives conflicting signals as to how it will decide this case. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the court rejected a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-in-unconstitutional-districts-us-supreme-court-upended-decades-of-precedent-in-2022-by-allowing-voters-to-vote-with-gerrymandered-maps-instead-of-fixing-the-congressional-districts-first-227124\">challenge to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> related to Alabama’s congressional districts. In 2024, the court overruled a lower court’s finding of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/voting-rights-at-risk-after-supreme-court-makes-it-harder-to-challenge-racial-gerrymandering-232359\">racial vote dilution in South Carolina</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267269/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sam D.

During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create <a href=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/about/k-12-education/severe-weather/hurricane-simulation\">computer simulations to forecast</a> how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you’re trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating <a href=\"https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/research/theory-computational-methods/space-weather-modeling-framework/\">these simulations gets a little more complex</a>. To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the Sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place.</p>\n\n<p>Space weather is very different from the storms you see on Earth. These events come from the Sun, which ejects eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields from its surface. The most powerful of these events are called <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\">interplanetary coronal mass ejections</a>, or CMEs, which travel at speeds approaching 1,800 miles per second (2,897 kilometers per second). </p>\n\n<p>To put that in perspective, a single CME could move a mass of material equivalent to all the Great Lakes from New York City to Los Angeles in just under two seconds – almost faster than it takes to say “space weather.”</p>\n\n<p>When these CMEs hit Earth, they can <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms\">cause geomagnetic storms</a>, which manifest in the sky as beautiful auroras.

This work had found geomagnetic storms occurring during periods when no solar eruptions were predicted to hit Earth. </p>\n\n<p>Bewildered, the space weather expert wanted to know if there could be space weather events that were smaller than coronal mass ejections and did not originate directly from solar eruptions. He predicted that such events might form in the space between the Sun and Earth, instead of in the Sun’s atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>One example of such smaller space weather events is a magnetic flux rope – bundles of magnetic fields wrapped around each other like a rope. Its detection in computer simulations of solar eruptions would hint to where these space weather events may be forming. Unlike satellite observations, in simulations you can turn back the clock or track an event upstream to see where they originate.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NkQmnuCsGM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Sometimes the Sun ejects masses of plasma and magnetic field lines, called coronal mass ejections.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So he asked the other author, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l4z7PzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a leading simulation expert</a>. It turned out that finding smaller space weather events was not as simple as simulating a big solar eruption and letting the computer model run long enough for the eruption to reach Earth. Current computer simulations are not meant to resolve these smaller events. Instead, they are designed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRzID3ZNqY\">focus on the large solar eruptions</a> because these have the most effects on infrastructure on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>This shortfall was quite disappointing. It was like trying to forecast a hurricane with a simulation that only shows you global weather patterns. Because you can’t see a hurricane at that scale, you would completely miss it.</p>\n\n<p>These larger-scale simulations are known as global simulations. They study how solar eruptions form on the Sun’s surface and travel through space. These simulations treat streams of charged particles and magnetic fields floating through space as fluids to reduce the computational cost, compared with modeling every charged particle independently. It’s like measuring the overall temperature of water in a bottle, instead of tracking every single water molecule individually.</p>\n\n<p>Because these simulations are computational phenomena that happen across such a vast space, they can’t resolve every detail. To affordably resolve the vast space between the Sun and the planets, researchers divide the space into large cubes – analogous to two-dimensional pixels in a camera. In the simulation, these cubes each represent an area 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) wide, tall and across. That distance is equivalent to about 1% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. </p>\n\n<h2>The search begins</h2>\n\n<p>Our search began with what felt like hunting for a needle in a haystack. We were looking into old global simulations, searching for a tiny, transient blob – which would signify a flux rope – within an area of space hundreds of times wider than the Sun itself. Our initial search did not yield anything.</p>\n\n<p>We then shifted our focus to the simulations of the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/\">May 2024 solar eruption event</a>. This time, we specifically looked at the region where the solar eruption collided into a quiet flow of charged particles and magnetic fields, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-solar-storms-and-the-solar-wind-3-astrophysicists-explain-how-particles-coming-from-the-sun-interact-with-earth-264013\">called the solar wind</a>, ahead of it. </p>\n\n<p>There it was: a distinct system of <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2544/1/012002\">magnetic flux ropes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, our excitement was short-lived. We could not tell where these flux ropes came from. The modeled flux ropes were also too small to survive, eventually fizzling out because they became too small to resolve with our simulation grid. </p>\n\n<p>But that was the type of clue we needed – the presence of flux ropes at the location where the solar eruption collided with the solar wind.</p>\n\n<p>To settle the issue, we decided to bridge this gap and create a computer model with a finer grid size than those previous global simulations used. Since increasing the resolution across the entire simulation space would have been prohibitively expensive, we decided to only increase the simulation resolution along the trajectory of the flux ropes. </p>\n\n<p>The new simulations could now resolve features that spanned distances six times Earth’s 8,000-mile (or 128,000-kilometer) diameter down to tens of thousands of miles – nearly 100 times better than previous simulations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=233&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694441/original/file-20251005-56-n8ua8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=293&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A comparison of low and enhanced simulation grid sizes.

The results were astonishing. </p>\n\n<p>The high-resolution view revealed that the flux ropes formed when the solar eruption slammed into the slower solar wind ahead of it. The new structures possessed incredible complexity and strength that persisted far longer than we expected. In meteorological terms, it was like watching a hurricane spawn a cluster of tornadoes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adf855\">We found that</a> the magnetic fields in these vortices were strong enough to trigger a significant geomagnetic storm and cause some real trouble here on Earth. But most importantly, the simulations confirmed that there are indeed space weather events that form locally in the space between the Sun and Earth. Our next step is to simulate how such tornado-like features in the solar wind may impact our planet and infrastructure.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph6u6No_8sY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">This two-dimensional cut of the simulation box shows a solar eruption that moves toward Earth quickly.

I believe the cause is an issue called response error. It means that respondents don’t interpret a question in the way the researcher thinks they will. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the answers people provide don’t really reflect what the researcher thinks the answers show.</p>\n\n<p>For example, asking whether someone would support the use of force to achieve a political goal raises the question of what the respondent thinks “use of force” means in this context. It could be interpreted as violence, but it could also be interpreted as using legal means to “force” someone to do something. </p>\n\n<p>Such response errors have been a concern for pollsters <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_of_Asking_Questions/GPD_AwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">ever since survey research began</a>. They can affect even seemingly straightforward questions. </p>\n\n<h2>What did you mean by that?</h2>\n\n<p>To avoid this problem, I used an <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/products/engage/\">AI interviewing system</a> developed by <a href=\"https://www.cloudresearch.com/\">CloudResearch</a>, a well-known survey research company, to ask respondents some of the same questions about political violence from previous surveys. Then I used it to ask what they were thinking when they answered those questions. This process is called <a href=\"https://www.hkr.se/contentassets/9ed7b1b3997e4bf4baa8d4eceed5cd87/gordonwillis.pdf/\">cognitive interviewing</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I then used AI to go through these interviews and categorize them. Two short reports that summarize this process as applied to both polls are <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report.html\">available</a> <a href=\"https://rkennedy01.github.io/use_of_force_ci/report2.html\">online</a>. These analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the results should be considered very preliminary.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the results clearly demonstrate that respondents interpret these questions in very different ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Nuance matters</h2>\n\n<p>For example, in my survey, about 33% of Democrats agreed with the statement that “use of force is justified to remove President Trump from office.” However, when asked why they agreed, more than 57% gave responses like this: “I was not thinking physically but more in the sense that he – the president – might need to be ‘fired’ or forced out of office due to rules or laws.” Still others were envisioning future scenarios where a president illegally seizes power in a coup.</p>\n\n<p>Once you account for these different interpretations of the question, the AI only coded about 8% of Democrats as supporting use of force in violent terms under current conditions. </p>\n\n<p>Even here, there was substantial ambiguity – for example, this type of response was not unusual: “The language ‘use of force’ was a bit too broad for me. I could not justify killing Trump, for example, but less extreme uses of force were valid in my eyes.”</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, 29% of Republicans agreed that “use of the military is justified to stop protests against President Trump’s agenda.” However, almost all of the respondents who agreed with this statement envisioned the National Guard interceding nonviolently to stop violent protests and riots. Only about 2.6% of Republicans gave comments supporting use of the military against nonviolent protests.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all those who agreed that use of the military was justified expressed thoughts like this: “I see the military coming and acting as a police force to stop or prevent the demonstrations that become violent. Peaceful protesters must be allowed to exercise their right to free speech.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is political violence justified?</h2>\n\n<p>Even questions that explicitly ask about political violence are open to wide interpretation. Take, for example, this question: “Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to resort to violence in order to achieve political goals?” </p>\n\n<p>The lack of a specific scenario or location in this question invites respondents to engage in all kinds of philosophical and historical speculation. </p>\n\n<p>In my survey, almost 15% of respondents said violence could sometimes be justified. When asked about the examples they were thinking of, respondents cited the American Revolution, the anti-Nazi French Resistance and many other incidents as a reason for their responses. Only about 3% of respondents said they were thinking about actions in the U.S. at the current time.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, almost all respondents stated that violence should be a last resort when all other peaceful and legal methods fail.</p>\n\n<p>One respondent illustrated both problems with one sentence: “The (American) colonists tried petitions and negotiations first, but, when those efforts failed, they resorted to armed conflict to gain independence.”</p>\n\n<h2>A call for understanding</h2>\n\n<p>Even these numbers likely overestimate Americans’ support for political violence. I read the interviews, checking the AI system’s labeling, and concluded that, if anything, it was overestimating support for violence.</p>\n\n<p>Other factors may also be distorting reports of public support for political violence. Many surveys are conducted primarily online. One study estimated that anywhere from 4% to 7% of respondents in online surveys are “<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/assessing-the-risks-to-online-polls-from-bogus-respondents/\">bogus respondents</a>” who are selecting arbitrary responses. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2116870119\">Another study</a> reported that such respondents dramatically increase positive responses on questions about political violence.</p>\n\n<p>Respondents may also be willing to espouse attitudes anonymously online that they would never say or do in real life. Studies have suggested that “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/1094931041291295\">online disinhibition effects</a>” or “<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131087\">survey trolling</a>” can impact survey results.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, my preliminary research suggests that response error is a substantial problem in surveys about political violence. </p>\n\n<p>Americans almost universally condemn the recent political violence they have witnessed. The recent poll results showing otherwise more likely stem from confusion about what the questions are asking than actual support for political violence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266113/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Kennedy does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Only when finally captured did we discover this wily brown anole was <a href=\"https://www.anoleannals.org/2019/06/14/weird-lizard-with-three-and-a-half-legs/\">missing its entire left hind leg</a>.

Our research uncovered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/737525\">122 cases of limb loss across 58 lizard species</a> and revealed that these “three-legged pirates” – the rare survivors of traumatic injuries – can run just as fast, maintain healthy body weight, reproduce successfully and live surprisingly long lives.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, most lizards probably do not survive such devastating injuries.

For decades, scientists have demonstrated that even tiny differences in leg length between individual lizards can mean the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54302-1\">difference between life and death</a> – affecting their ability to escape predators, catch prey and find mates.</p>\n\n<p>Since subtle variations matter so much, biologists have long assumed that losing an entire limb should be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>Yet our global survey tells a different story about these remarkable survivors. Working with colleagues across six continents, we found limb-damaged lizards across nearly all major lizard families, from tiny geckos to massive iguanas.</p>\n\n<p>These animals had clearly healed from whatever trauma caused their injuries – likely accidents or the failed attempts of a predator to eat them. Perhaps most remarkably, we documented surviving limb loss even in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2009.07.001\">chameleons, tree-climbing specialists</a> whose movements seem to require perfect limb coordination.</p>\n\n<h2>Thriving, not just surviving</h2>\n\n<p>The body condition of these lizards was most surprising. Rather than appearing malnourished, many limb-damaged lizards were actually heavier than expected for their size, suggesting they were successfully finding food despite their handicap. Some were actively reproducing, with females found carrying eggs and males observed successfully mating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"4 side by side X-ray images in black and white of small lizards each missing a limb\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=229&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/683568/original/file-20250802-56-vhwfsi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=287&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Limb damage can be fairly common in some lizard populations, such as these X-rays of brown anoles (<em>Anolis sagrei</em>) from the Bahamas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jason Kolbe/Jonathan Losos</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These findings force us to reconsider some basic assumptions about how evolution might work in wild populations.

To an untrained eye, a small piece of radium may look like a chip off a regular gray rock. But radium can invisibly emit radiation – energy and small fragments of itself – that you can’t feel, see or smell. And that invisible radiation can hurt you, without you even noticing right away. </p>\n\n<p>What’s going on with this silent threat that can stealthily damage your body in ways that can take years to reveal themselves? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chemistry.richmond.edu/faculty/kdonald/\">As a chemist</a>, I’m interested in what makes different elements safe to handle or hazardous. This dangerous release of radiation is called radioactivity, and even though its source may look unassuming, it can burn you or even give you diseases that don’t manifest for years.</p>\n\n<h2>Atoms and isotopes</h2>\n\n<p>Everything you see around you – your skin, rocks, the pages of books – is all made up of different combinations of <a href=\"https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/A00493\">extremely small particles called atoms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An atom has a small, dense center called the nucleus. Negatively charged particles called electrons move around the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, there are two types of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons.</p>\n\n<p>All atoms with the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">same number of protons in their nuclei</a> are <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/\">the same element</a>. Besides radium, some elements you may have heard of are carbon and oxygen. All carbon atoms have six protons and all oxygen atoms have eight protons.

Once past a threshold, the changes reinforce themselves, amplifying until the system transforms into something new.</p>\n\n<p>Almost as soon as “tipping points” entered the climate science lexicon — following Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 book, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” — scientists warned the public <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/441785a\">not to confuse global warming policy benchmarks with precise thresholds</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A tall glacier front seen from above shows huge chunks of ice calving off into Disko Bay.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695746/original/file-20251011-56-myxwe2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Greenland ice sheet, which is 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick at its thickest point, has been losing mass for several years as temperatures rise and more of its ice is lost to the ocean.

Some models place the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1449\">critical threshold at 1.6 C</a> (2.9 F). More recent simulations <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090471\">estimate runaway conditions at 2.7 C</a> (4.9 F) of warming.

Reports suggest employees <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/nationwide-flight-delays-loom-as-air-traffic-controllers-call-out-sick/\">have been calling in sick</a> in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/airlines-urge-patience-us-air-traffic-staffing-issues-continue-2025-10-10/\">thousands of flights delayed or canceled</a> since the shutdown began.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. asked <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/strzempkowski.1\">Brian Strzempkowski</a> and <a href=\"https://aviation.osu.edu/people/dickman.49\">Melanie Dickman</a>, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.</em> </p>\n\n<h2>How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?</h2>\n\n<p>Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-workers-back-bay-shutdown-785eb776d2312d1f68f7e91961d0a93a\">created some uncertainty</a> around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2020/05/29/the-most-stressful-job-in-the-world-what-its-really-like-to-be-an-air-traffic-controller/\">most stressful jobs there is</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, there have been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/airports-face-delays-as-shutdown-deepens-air-traffic-control-staffing-woes\">reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick</a> in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the <a href=\"https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/news/us-shutdown-faa-training-airlines-warning/\">2018-2019 shutdown</a>, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills. </p>\n\n<p>In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers\">threatened to fire these “problem children</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>What does this mean for people about to take a flight?</h2>\n\n<p>Before the shutdown, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5544703-airport-delays-government-shutdown/\">there was already a critical shortage</a> of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.</p>\n\n<p>A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety.</p>\n\n<p>The air traffic control system <a href=\"https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/ap-this-redundant-aviation-safety-net-helps-keep-planes-safe-when-controllers-lose-contact/\">is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it</a> to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate. </p>\n\n<p>As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/EWR-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2014.pdf\">can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft</a> departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">capacity was limited</a> to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport\">was personally involved</a> in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a colorful plane flies near the top of an air traffic control tower\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695721/original/file-20251010-56-n8wvra.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CongressFAA/1336d24012c9446bbc4fee9d90918c07/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How does the US keep air travel safe?</h2>\n\n<p>On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/nas_ops/atcscc\">Air Traffic Control System Command Center</a>, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system. </p>\n\n<p>When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/air-traffic-controllers-working-pay-begin-call-sick/story?id=126289491\">recently reporting that no controllers were available</a>, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace. </p>\n\n<h2>Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?</h2>\n\n<p>There has been a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">systemic problem with hiring</a> of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-traffic-controller-shortages-in-newark-and-other-airports-partly-reflect-long-intense-training-but-university-based-training-programs-are-becoming-part-of-the-solution-249715\">FAA’s plan to utilize colleges</a> across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/fclassiles/2025-09/DOT_Shutdown_Plan_9.30.25.pdf\">limited funding</a> from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown <a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/faa-academy-okc-shutdown-air-traffic-control-trainees/68992559\">can remain for many months</a> after the government reopens.  </p>\n\n<h2>What’s the government doing to end the shortage?</h2>\n\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/07/01/bill-fix-air-traffic-control-system/83788771007/\">Congress authorized over US$12 billion</a> in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary Duffy <a href=\"https://www.executivegov.com/articles/dot-duffy-faa-prime-contractor-air-traffic-control\">is currently leading an effort</a> to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-administration-needs-another-19-billion-fully-revamp-air-traffic-control-2025-07-16/\">additional $19 billion investment</a> will be needed to complete the task.</p>\n\n<p><em>The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267093/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Melanie Dickman is a member-at-large of Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA)</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brian Strzempkowski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

For example, in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, <a href=\"https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/about-galapagos/conservation-challenges/invasive-species/\">invasive species like rats and feral cats</a> are considered one of the main causes of extinctions, including to the islands’ famous birds. In Australia’s Gondwana Rainforest, the last vestiges of an ancient plant and animal “<a href=\"https://www.wettropics.gov.au/living-museum\">living museum</a>” are retreating due to invading non-native species.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People walk along a path near the face of a large swath of white and blue ice.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695708/original/file-20251010-56-p7ns0k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Tourists view the face of the Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/august-2025-argentina-perito-moreno-tourists-look-out-over-news-photo/2228085187\">Romina Cruz/picture alliance via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Threats from people</h2>\n\n<p>Additional human pressures are also endangering these unique areas. Threats to these sites from the outside include logging and mining in the region, developing nearby land, diverting natural water flows, and polluting the air, water and land. Roughly two-thirds of the sites studied face at least some danger from human activities happening outside the sites’ formal boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the report says heritage sites need more financial support to be better able to respond to key threats. It finds that most lack consistent, long-term funding for staff salaries, ecosystem monitoring, and continued <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/document/221425\">maintenance of protection programs</a>. Chronic underfunding is the primary barrier to effective ecosystem management. Funding typically comes from organizations such as the World Heritage Fund or the <a href=\"https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/publications/gef-8-corporate-scorecard-june-2025\">Global Environment Facility</a>, an organization made up of 186 member countries, institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector that funds environmental projects worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The IUCN report warns that even effective initiatives may struggle in the long term without stronger regional, national and global support. That could include efforts like the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/984/\">Okavango’s Community Management for Protected Areas Conservation</a> program, which connects rural communities and conservationists to support both people and nature.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Armed people in camouflage clothing walk through a wooded area.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695707/original/file-20251010-56-uyxyj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Members of the Lion Intervention Brigade conduct an anti-poaching patrol at Niokolo-Koba National Park, Senegal.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateSenegalIllegalBigCatTrade/93754acdb53249efb201a846cfc2f1d8/photo\">AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What is missing from the 2025 report?</h2>\n\n<p>There is good news, though. Targeted local action, such as <a href=\"https://iucnsos.org/projects/stopping-the-bleeding-increased-enforcement-capacity-for-thailands-thap-lan-national-park-to-address-rampant-rosewood-poaching/\">anti-poaching efforts</a> and local community involvement, have improved conditions at four sites in West and Central Africa, shifting their status from “critical” to “significant concern.”</p>\n\n<p>There is more to know about these sites and how they are faring. As a community-based conservation scholar, I recognize that while the major drivers of ecological decline can be gleaned from published research, specific causes of that decline are best learned on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>The outlook provides critical environmental trends, but it could be strengthened by including specifics based on quantitative, community-based monitoring, such as wildlife population surveys by local experts. For instance, at a conference I attended in 2024, a frog biologist from Botswana observed that, before her work, the previous frog study in that part of the delta was in 1980.</p>\n\n<p>While critical local and Indigenous knowledge is recognized in the report, it is largely excluded from assessments, both because weaving it with conventional scientific analysis is difficult or because communities may choose to protect certain knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The Okavango Delta is one of many World Heritage sites, living landscapes rich with local cultural value and global significance. Like many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13304\">remote heritage sites outside Europe and North America</a>, there is a lot that remains unknown about biodiversity in the Okavango. </p>\n\n<p>The report acknowledges that recognizing the relationship between people and the environment would also improve future assessments. Overall, it offers a clear picture of global conservation trends while also acknowledging local realities and successes: for the heritage sites across the planet, conservation succeeds when people and nature thrive together.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266548/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jessica Beaudette received dissertation funding from the American Association of University Women and Arizona State University for field research in Botswana. </span></em></p>",

And her courage in having participated in an unfair contest and in exposing Maduro’s fraud by <a href=\"https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2024-07-30-u1-e207888-s27061-nid286010-maria-corina-machado-publica-actas-votacion-poder\">publishing the true vote tallies</a> on the internet, surely made Machado stand out to the Nobel committee.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in making Machado the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html\">2025 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a>, organizers <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2025/machado/facts/\">stated they were recognizing</a> her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”</p>\n\n<p>But as a <a href=\"https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/sociology/people/david-smilde\">scholar of Venezuela’s political process</a>, I know that is only part of the story. Machado is in many ways a controversial pick, less a peace activist than a political operator willing to use some of the trade’s dark arts for the greater democratic good.</p>\n\n<h2>Joining a controversial list of laureates</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, many <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/here-are-the-most-controversial-noble-prize-winners-ever.html\">Nobel Peace Prize awards generate controversy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It has often been bestowed on great politicians over activists. And sometimes the prize’s winners can have complex pasts and very non-peaceful resumes. </p>\n\n<p>Past recipients include Henry Kissinger, who as U.S. secretary of state and Richard Nixon’s security adviser was responsible for the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/henry-kissingers-bombing-campaign-likely-killed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cambodians-and-set-path-for-the-ravages-of-the-khmer-rouge-209353\">illegal bombing of Cambodia</a>, supporting Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/henry-kissinger-and-the-murder-of-timor-leste/\">brutal invasion of East Timor</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kissingers-obsession-with-chile-enabled-a-murderous-dictatorship-that-still-haunts-the-country-218982\">propping up dictators</a> in Latin America, among many other morally dubious actions. Similarly, former Palestinian Liberation Organization leader <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1994/summary/\">Yasser Arafat</a> and Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1978/begin/facts/\">Menachem Begin</a> were both awarded the prize, in 1994 and 1978 respectively, despite their past association with violent activities in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three men stand, two shaking hands.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695714/original/file-20251010-66-nwuadl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Yitzhak Rabin – all Nobel Peace Prize laureates.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/yasser-arafat-henry-kissinger-and-yitzhak-rabin-at-unesco-news-photo/952432476?adppopup=true\">Duclos/Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Nobel Committee often seems to use these awards not to celebrate past achievements but to affect the future course of events. The nods to Begin and Arafat were, in this way, used for encouragement of the Middle East peace process. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, sometimes, the peace prize is seemingly bestowed as a sign of approval for a break from the past.</p>\n\n<p>Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/obama/facts/\">won his in 2009</a> despite only being nine months into his presidency. It was taken by many as a rejection of the previous presidency of George W. Bush, rather than recognition of Obama’s limited achievements at that time.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2016/santos/facts/\">Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos</a> was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just days after his peace plan was rejected in a referendum. In that instance, the committee seemed to want to give his efforts a push just after a major setback.</p>\n\n<h2>Democratic path or dark arts?</h2>\n\n<p>So what should be made of the Nobel Peace Prize committee’s decision to recognize opposition to Maduro now?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly Machado’s profile is ascendant. In her political career, she has participated in elections – winning a seat in the National Assembly in 2010 – but boycotted many more. She also boycotted negotiation processes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OxULhCJJEc\">suggesting instead that foreign intervention</a> was the only way to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023 she returned to the electoral path and steadfastly mobilized the Venezuelan population for opposition primaries and presidential elections, even after her <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/01/27/venezuela-s-supreme-court-disqualifies-opposition-leader-from-running-for-president_6469941_4.html\">candidacy was disqualified</a> by the government-controlled electoral authority, and innumerable other obstacles were put in her path. </p>\n\n<p>The campaign included spearheading caravans and events across the country at significant personal risk. </p>\n\n<p>However, much of her fight since then has been via less-democratic means.</p>\n\n<p>Machado has shunned local and regional elections suggesting there was no sense in participating until the government honored the results of the 2024 presidential election. She has also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-trump-support-maduro.html\">again sought international intervention</a> to remove Maduro.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past year she has aggressively <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/05/us-intel-memo-undercuts-trump-claims-about-venezuelan-gang-00330542\">promoted the discredited theory</a> that Maduro is in control of the Tren de Aragua gang and is using it to invade the United States – a narrative <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/venezuela-and-us-edge-toward-war-footing-but-domestic-concerns-international-risks-may-hold-washington-back-266509\">gladly accepted and repurposed</a> by U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to being the expressed motivation for a U.S. military buildup off the coasts of Venezuela, this theory has also been the central justification cited by the Trump administration for using the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11269\">Alien Enemies Act</a> to deport, without due process, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">238 Venezuelan men to a horrific prison</a> in El Salvador.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A large painting of a man is held aloft.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695713/original/file-20251010-56-hn0fum.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nicolas Maduro continues to loom large and rule Venezuela despite María Corina Machado’s efforts.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/pro-government-supporters-carry-a-drawing-of-president-of-news-photo/2229626580?adppopup=true\">Jesus Vargas/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Relations with Trump</h2>\n\n<p>The Nobel Peace Prize could help unify the Venezuelan opposition movement, which over the past year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/nx-s1-5389718/why-venezuelas-opposition-has-urged-voters-to-boycott-upcoming-regional-elections\">has begun to fray over differences in strategy</a>, especially with respect to Machado’s return to electoral boycotts. </p>\n\n<p>And it will certainly draw more international attention to Venezuelans’ struggle for democracy and could galvanize international stakeholders to push for change.</p>\n\n<p>What it will mean in terms of Trump’s relationship to Machado and Venezuela is yet to be seen. Her main connection with the administration is through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/nobel-trump-rubio-venezuela.html\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio</a>, who has aggressively represented her views and is pushing for U.S. military intervention to depose Maduro</p>\n\n<p>Awarding Machado the prize could strengthen Trump’s resolve to seek regime change in Venezuela. Or, if he feels snubbed by the Nobel committee after very vocally <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-would-have-been-an-unsuitable-choice-for-the-2025-nobel-peace-prize-but-he-may-be-a-more-serious-contender-in-2026-267067\">lobbying to be awarded</a> the peace prize himself, it could be a wedge between the U.S. president and Machado. </p>\n\n<p>Machado seems to understand this. After not mentioning him in her first statement after the award was announced, she has since mentioned him multiple times, even dedicating the prize to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5549522-trump-machado-nobel-peace-prize/\">both the Venezuelan people and Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/machado-congratulated-by-trump-dedicates-award-partly-to-him\">called to congratulate her</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A game changer? Perhaps not</h2>\n\n<p>To the degree that the Nobel Peace Prize is not just a model of change but a model for change, the decision to award it to Machado could conceivably affect the nature of Venezuela’s struggle against authoritarianism, leading her to continue to seek the restoration of democracy with a greater focus on reconciliation and coexistence among all Venezuelans, including the still politically relevant followers of the late Hugo Chávez.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the impact, it probably will not be game-changing. As we have seen with other winners, the initial glow of public recognition is quickly consumed by political conflict.</p>\n\n<p>And in Venezuela, there is no easy way to translate this prize into real democratic progress. </p>\n\n<p>While Machado and other Venezuelan democrats may have more support than ever among global democrats, Nicolás Maduro controls all of Venezuela’s institutions including the armed forces and the state oil company, which, even when sanctioned, provides substantial resources. Maduro also has forged <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/maduros-allies-who-backs-venezuelan-regime\">strategic alliances with China, Russia and Iran</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The only way one can imagine the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, with or without military action, is through an extensive process of negotiation, reconciliation, disarmament and justice that could lay the groundwork for coexistence. This Nobel Peace Prize could position Machado for this task.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267268/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Smilde does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Devoret</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/martinis/facts/\">John M. Martinis</a> – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven.</p>\n\n<p>The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the <a href=\"https://quantum2025.org/\">100th anniversary</a> of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/\">precision measurement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/summary/\">laser technology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1952/summary/\">medical imaging</a> and, probably the most far-reaching of all, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/summary/\">semiconductor electronic devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/summary/\">computer chips</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings.</p>\n\n<h2>The promises of quantum machines</h2>\n\n<p>Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2012/summary/\">photons and atomic ions</a>, that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions.

Distant objects can manifest <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/press-release/\">quantum entanglement</a> – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. </p>\n\n<p>The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality?</p>\n\n<h2>Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit</h2>\n\n<p>In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0829-5\">affirmative answer</a> to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1913/summary/\">superconductors</a>. Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/summary/\">Cooper pair</a>. These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls.</p>\n\n<p>To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/summary/\">Josephson junction</a>, which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1908\">quantum tunneling</a>, where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1543\">quantized, values</a>, which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications and outlooks</h2>\n\n<p>The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.69.80\">distinct quantum phenomena</a> – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting artificial atoms</a> has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812\">quantum computers</a> using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting quantum bit</a>, or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. The perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgMWommXxU8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">2025 Nobel laureate John Martinis discusses the roadmap of building a quantum computer at the 2016 Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference in Los Angeles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. The prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation. </p>\n\n<p>From those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. The combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation. </p>\n\n<p>This Nobel Prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266976/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Zhixin Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That has left market-watchers and monetary policymakers somewhat in the dark over key indicators in the U.S. economy.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers</a> is unaffected by the impasse in Washington and released its preliminary monthly report on Oct. 10, 2025; the final read of the month will be released in two weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Conversation U.S. spoke with <a href=\"https://src.isr.umich.edu/research/faculty-profiles/profiles/joanne-hsu/\">Joanne Hsu</a>, the director of the Surveys of Consumers, on what the latest data shows about consumer sentiment – and whether the shutdown has left Americans feeling blue.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What is consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>Consumer sentiment is something that we at the University of Michigan have <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">measured since 1946</a>. It looks at American attitudes toward the current state of the economy and the future direction of the economy through questions on personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions for big-ticket items.</p>\n\n<p>Over the decades, it has been closely followed by policymakers, business leaders, academic researchers and investors as a leading indicator of the overall state of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>When sentiment is on the decline, consumers tend to pull back on spending – and that can lead to a slowdown in the economy. The opposite is also true: High or rising sentiment tends to lead to increased spending and a growing economy.</p>\n\n<h2>How is the survey compiled?</h2>\n\n<p>Every month, we interview a random sample of the U.S. population across the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Around 1,000 or so people take part in it every month, and we include a representative sample across ages, income, education level, demography and geography. People from across all walks of life are asked around 50 questions pertaining to the economy, personal finances, job prospects, inflation expectations and the like.</p>\n\n<p>When you aggregate that all together, it gives a useful measure of the health of the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<h2>What does the latest survey show?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">latest survey</a> shows virtually no change in overall sentiment between September and October. Consumers are not feeling that optimistic at the moment, but generally no worse than they were last month.</p>\n\n<p>Pocketbook issues – high prices of goods, inflation and possible weakening in the labor market – are suppressing sentiment. Views of consumers across the country converged earlier in the year when the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-sentiment-deteriorates-sharply-march-2025-03-14/\">Trump administration’s tariffs</a> were announced. But since then, higher-wealth and higher-income consumers have reported improved consumer sentiment. It is for lower-income Americans – those not owning stock – that sentiment hasn’t lifted since April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, we also saw a slight decline in inflation expectations, but it remains relatively high – midway between where they were around a year ago and the highs of around the time of the tariff announcements in April and May.</p>\n\n<h2>Has the government shutdown affected consumer sentiment?</h2>\n\n<p>The government shutdown was in place for around half the time of the latest survey period, which ran from Sept. 23-Oct. 6, 2025. And so far, we are not seeing evidence that it is impacting consumer sentiment one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>And that is not super-surprising. It is not that people don’t care about the shutdown, just that it hasn’t affected how they see the economy and their personal finances yet.</p>\n\n<p>History shows that federal shutdowns do move the needle a little. In 2019, around 10% of people spontaneously mentioned the then-shutdown in the January survey. We saw a <a href=\"https://sfa.senate.michigan.gov/Publications/EconInd/MEI_JAN19.pdf\">decline in sentiment</a> in that month, but it did improve again the following month.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, we tend to see stronger reaction to shutdowns when there is a debt ceiling crisis attached. In 2013, for example, there was a <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/11/shutdown-fears-drive-consumer-sentiment-to-9-month-low\">decline in consumer sentiment</a> coinciding with concerns over the debt ceiling being breached. But it did quickly rebound when the government opened again.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not we see a decline in sentiment because of the current shutdown depends on how long it lasts – and how consumers believe it will impact pocketbook issues, namely prices and job prospects.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267264/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanne Hsu receives research funding from NIA, NIH, and various sponsors of the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. </span></em></p>",

In 1858, a baby first named Hakadah, later called Ohíye S’a, who then became widely known as Charles Alexander Eastman for most of his adult life, was born near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. A Wahpeton Santee Dakota, he fled to Manitoba, Canada, with tribal members during <a href=\"https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/us-dakota-war\">the 1862 Dakota War</a> between the U.S. military and several bands of Dakota collectively known as the Santee Sioux.</p>\n\n<p>In December 1890, the two unexpectedly met each other while working at the <a href=\"https://history.sd.gov/archives/forms/indian%20archives/Indian%20Archives%20Project/pineridge.pdf?\">Pine Ridge Agency</a> in the newly declared state of South Dakota. Even more improbably, they fell in love. </p>\n\n<p>Just weeks later, booming Hotchkiss rifles 15 miles away signaled <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/native-american/disaster-at-wounded-knee/\">the start of the Wounded Knee Massacre</a>. Federal troops ended up killing at least 250 Lakota Sioux men, women and children; the traumatic event, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=a1fiNgoA_4cC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=wounded%20knee%20signaled&amp;f=false\">historian David Martínez writes</a>, sparked “the abrupt transformation of Indian nations from geopolitical powers … to symbols of conquest.”</p>\n\n<p>It also transformed Goodale and Eastman’s nascent relationship: They resolved to marry and to work together for Native American causes.</p>\n\n<p>Wounded Knee, however, would also prove an unfortunate metaphor for their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>In the research for my new dual biography, “<a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837915/love-and-loss-after-wounded-knee/\">Love and Loss After Wounded Knee: A Biography of an Extraordinary Interracial Marriage</a>,” I dove into letters, photographs and hundreds of newspaper articles documenting this high-profile, late-19th-century relationship. </p>\n\n<p>I came to understand that their marriage failed not only because of interpersonal tensions and a clash of values, but also because of some of the ways in which ideas about gender, race and Indigenous identity were rapidly changing in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>From writer to teacher</h2>\n\n<p>At 13, Goodale started publishing poetry in <a href=\"https://www.carnegielibrary.org/st-nicholas-magazine/\">St. Nicholas Magazine</a>, a popular children’s periodical. Her poems generated attention from the press, in addition to fan mail from notable men of letters, including <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/henry-wadsworth-longfellow\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. By the time she was 20, she had published five books. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of young woman.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=793&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695242/original/file-20251008-56-frpj07.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=997&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Elaine Goodale Eastman in 1890, when she worked as the Supervisor of Education for the Dakotas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">South Dakota Historical Society</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But because poets without family fortunes needed other means to support themselves – and because women in the late 1800s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/hwj/23.1.59\">had few career options</a> – Goodale turned to teaching. She accepted a job at Virginia’s <a href=\"https://home.hamptonu.edu/about/history/\">Hampton Institute</a>, a boarding school that was founded to teach newly emancipated Black students. It later became part of the government’s program to assimilate Native Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Goodale became convinced that Indigenous children would benefit more from schools in their own communities, rather than at government- or church-run boarding schools. She traveled to <a href=\"https://www.history.nd.gov/archives/stateagencies/dtrecords.html\">the Dakota Territory</a> and opened a day school. She also turned from poetry to prose, documenting her observations of “Indian life and education” in dozens of articles. </p>\n\n<p>By the time she came to Pine Ridge Agency, the administrative offices at the Oglala Lakota Indian Reservation, she had been appointed the first supervisor of education for the Dakotas.</p>\n\n<h2>The ideal ‘assimilated Indian’</h2>\n\n<p>Ohíye S’a’s early years were marked by family trauma and U.S. government policies aimed at seizing land and displacing and assimilating Native people. His mother died shortly after he was born, and during the Dakota War it was widely believed that his father and brothers had perished.

He was convinced that only a formal English-language education could provide a path forward for Native people.</p>\n\n<p>At his father’s urging, Ohíye S’a became “Charles Eastman,” and he also converted to Christianity. He attended a series of boarding schools before <a href=\"https://archive.dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/article/1984/10/1/ohiyesa-a-winner-lost-is-found\">landing at Dartmouth College</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/if_you_knew/ifyouknew_11.html\">Boston University Medical School</a>. </p>\n\n<p>His white mentors saw Eastman – the only Native person in his class at either institution – as the ideal “assimilated Indian.” His achievements often appeared in newspapers with headlines like “He’s a Winner: Sioux Indian Who Got a Boston University Degree,” an allusion to the fact that “Ohíye S’a” translated to “winner.”</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t clear whether Eastman ever thought of himself in that way. But throughout his life, he straddled the world in which he was raised and the one in which he was educated. His first job, as agency physician at Pine Ridge, placed him at the nexus of these two cultures.</p>\n\n<h2>An unlikely pair, a media sensation</h2>\n\n<p>After the shots rang out near Wounded Knee Creek, Eastman’s medical education was put to the test. Called into service as a nurse, Goodale also tended the wounded and dying in the makeshift hospital at a nearby church. </p>\n\n<p>Six months later, Elaine and Charles were married in New York City in June 1891, much to the consternation of her family.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white photo of soldiers standing around a ditch filled with corpses\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695227/original/file-20251008-56-8ut0t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A mass grave for Native Americans killed during the Wounded Knee Massacre.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/massengrab-f%C3%BCr-die-indianer-nach-derschlacht-am-wounded-news-photo/542360409?adppopup=true\">Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The couple’s nuptials appeared in hundreds of newspapers, partially due to the rarity of an interracial marriage in the 19th century. Much of the coverage <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837915/love-and-loss-after-wounded-knee/\">was rife with racist stereotypes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Watertown Times in New York proclaimed, “Poetess Marries a Big Injun’”; the San Francisco Examiner ran a front-page story declaring “Fair Bride of An Indian: Elaine Goodale Weds the Red Man of Her Choice.” </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, articles focused on Charles’ educational background, often misrepresenting it by suggesting he had attended Cornell, Harvard or Yale. He was referred to as a “specimen,” with racialized language discussing his physical attributes: “He is of medium height … with all the peculiarities of his people in his features. His eyes are small and glittering, his face and nose are broad and his cheek bones very pronounced,” according to the San Francisco Examiner.</p>\n\n<p>This type of media coverage – highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles’ backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways – would dog them throughout their marriage.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional travails, personal problems</h2>\n\n<p>Charles attempted to set up his own medical practice in St. Paul, Minnesota. But white patients proved reluctant to see “an Indian doctor,” while Native patients were hesitant to patronize a physician dispensing unfamiliar medicines. The practice failed.</p>\n\n<p>Financial pressures increased over the next decade as Elaine and Charles became parents of six children. They moved frequently: Charles took on a series of jobs, including recruiting for the YMCA, lobbying on behalf of the Santee Sioux, and working as an “outing agent” at <a href=\"https://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu/\">the Carlisle Indian Industrial School</a>, which involved finding summer placements for Native students with white families in a further attempt to Americanize them. </p>\n\n<p>Because Charles left behind few personal papers, it’s difficult to know if he believed in this program. But it’s easy to see how it could have created an identity crisis of sorts. </p>\n\n<p>At other points in his life, Charles seemed to put his Dakota identity front and center. For example, he was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians, an organization that worked on behalf of self-determination for Native Americans. He even served as its president in 1918. Meanwhile, his wife remained a staunch believer in assimilation.</p>\n\n<p>At Elaine’s urging – and likely, under her editorial stewardship – Charles began publishing stories and then books about his “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/337/337-h/337-h.htm\">Indian Boyhood</a>.” While Elaine continued writing and was able to publish a few books, his literary career took off and hers stalled out.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Cursive text.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=197&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695230/original/file-20251008-64-8pmb32.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A signature from a copy of one of Charles Eastman’s books, in which he uses both his Christian name and his Native American name, Ohíye S’a.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Charles_Eastman_Signature.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even their children weren’t spared from the headlines.

Other times he posed <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Charles_Eastman_(Ohiyesa).jpg\">in traditional Sioux regalia</a>. Often the coverage of his talks focused more on what he was wearing than the content of his lecture. Historian <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/kvigil\">Kiara Vigil</a> suggests that Charles knew that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=G03zCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=eastman#v=snippet&amp;q=eastman&amp;f=false\">his dress functioned as an advertisement for his work</a>, arguing that his choice of attire was strategic: “Eastman’s ability to dress up as an Indian, or not, enabled him to address diverse audiences and their expectations.”</p>\n\n<p>He was away from home more than he was present, further fueling Elaine’s resentment. In personal letters, she described her bitterness at Charles leaving the children and household to her sole care, and her belief that he was reinforcing the gender roles she’d railed against. While she certainly understood that his posing in buckskin and feathered headdress was good marketing, she probably never realized what reclaiming his Indigenous identity meant to Charles; she, too, thought of him as the product of successful assimilation.</p>\n\n<h2>It all falls apart</h2>\n\n<p>The personal and professional pressures on the Eastmans continued through the early years of the 20th century. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-40-3/the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman-the-mystery-of-the-other-woman-solved/vol-40-no-3-the-estrangement-of-charles-eastman-and-elaine-goodale-eastman.pdf\">They reached a breaking point after their second daughter</a>, Irene Taluta, died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. The tragic loss of a beloved child continued to unravel an already frayed marriage. </p>\n\n<p>Elaine and Charles separated in 1921, though they never formally divorced.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been interested in the Eastmans and their unlikely marriage since I first learned of it years ago.

The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after World War II, church leaders <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-forty-two?lang=eng\">overhauled their missionary approach</a> to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52616-0_4\">growth across the globe</a>, especially in <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8900/\">Central America</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5406/dialjmormthou.46.3.0045\">South America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724233515?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses\">Pacific Islands</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today, the church has over <a href=\"https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics\">17.5 million members</a>, according to church records. A majority <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/facts-statistics?lang=eng\">live outside the U.S.</a>, spread across <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/01/news-of-the-church/church-growing-in-more-than-160-countries?lang=eng\">more than 160 countries</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One way the church and researchers track this global growth is <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/members/2024/06/08/charts-growth-church-jesus-christ-latter-day-saints-1830-2023-member-temples-wards-stakes/\">by construction of new temples</a>.These buildings, used not for weekly worship but <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/temples\">special ceremonies</a> like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist <a href=\"https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/locations/\">in dozens of countries</a>, from Argentina to Tonga.</p>\n\n<p>During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2025/04/10/by-the-numbers-look-200-temples-announced-president-nelson-7-years/\">200 new temples</a>, more than any of his predecessors.

These <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#eligibility\">are colleges</a> where at least 25% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic or Latino.</p>\n\n<p>This is more than a legal technicality. It reflects the Justice Department’s position that HSI grants violate constitutional protections, putting millions of federal dollars for these schools at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Citing this legal rationale, the Department of Education confirmed in September that it had frozen <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">US$350 million in education grants</a> intended for <a href=\"https://cmsi.gse.rutgers.edu/content/what-are-msis\">Minority-Serving Institutions</a>. This includes more than $250 million for HSIs, specifically.</p>\n\n<p>The Education Department argues that these programs amount to racial discrimination because they tie <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-serving-institutions-university-grants-minority-4c4d2242373c0a974bcf65b24875cc7d\">federal grants</a> to students’ racial or ethnic backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>This echoes <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">the Supreme Court’s decision</a> in 2023, which narrowed how colleges can consider race and ethnicity in admissions.</p>\n\n<p>I serve as the university diversity officer at California State University, Chico, an HSI.

This amendment authorizes federal grants to help strengthen colleges that enroll large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students, providing more opportunity for those students to succeed and graduate. </p>\n\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/research/publications/hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis\">600 federally designated HSIs</a> across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. California is home to the most HSIs, with 167, followed by Texas, Puerto Rico, New York and Illinois. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to showing that at least 25% of its student population is Hispanic or Latino, any college or university that wants to qualify as an HSI must also show that at least half of its students come from <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ope/idues/eligibility-infographic.pdf\">low-income backgrounds</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an HSI allows colleges and universities to apply for federal funding intended to support underrepresented and low-income students.</p>\n\n<h2>HSIs vary in size and mission</h2>\n\n<p>HSIs enroll over <a href=\"https://www.edexcelencia.org/newsroom/over-600-colleges-and-universities-are-now-hispanic-serving-institutions,-enrolling-nearly-one-third-of-all-undergraduates\">1.5 million Hispanic students</a>, which amounts to over 60% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>This marks a big increase from the 340,000 Hispanic undergraduates who attended an HSI in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these schools are large public research universities, such as University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Santa Cruz. Others are regional institutions, private colleges and local community colleges. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, another kind of Hispanic-Serving Institution has emerged – research-intensive HSIs. These are colleges and universities where at least 25% of the student body is Hispanic and where there is significant research funding and a range of doctoral programs offered. These schools include University of California, Irvine; Florida International University; and the University of Texas at El Paso, <a href=\"https://www.hsru.org/\">among others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers <a href=\"https://www.equityinhighered.org/resources/ideas-and-insights/defining-servingness-at-hispanic-serving-institutions-hsis-practical-implications-for-hsi-leaders/\">have debated</a> whether the HSI category has become too broad, grouping schools with vastly different resources, missions and student populations. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their differences, <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12027/becoming-hispanic-serving-institutions?srsltid=AfmBOooRB0hS5b9YieGd3ENAMJwdlOQ2QzVxmCewbFgDjykctW1KBLgH\">many HSIs</a> enroll large numbers of first-generation, low-income and working students, as well as immigrants and transfer students. </p>\n\n<p>HSIs also generally operate with fewer financial and academic resources than comparable non-HSI institutions.</p>\n\n<h2>How HSI funding works</h2>\n\n<p>Title V grants from the Department of Education are one clear way that <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v\">HSIs can receive federal funding </a>. </p>\n\n<p>These competitive grants are intended to help HSIs expand educational opportunities and institutional capacity to support Hispanic and low-income students.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than providing aid directly to students, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-special-populations/grants-hispanic-students/developing-hispanic-serving-institutions-program-title-v#past-awards\">Title V grants</a> are used to offer faculty training, update classrooms and laboratories, create new degree programs and develop mentorship opportunities for first-generation students.</p>\n\n<p>At campuses such as California State University, Chico and University of California, Irvine, Title V grants have given schools the money to create bilingual advising services and maintain data systems.</p>\n\n<p>Title V grants form only one part of the <a href=\"https://hacu.net/advocacy/hsi-funding/\">broader funding picture for HSIs</a>. Like many colleges, HSIs rely on state funding and tuition revenue.

Hispanic students at these schools, which include Arizona State University and California State University, Fullerton, graduate at rates roughly 8 percentage points higher than Hispanic students nationally. </p>\n\n<p>Hispanic students at HSIs graduate at rates more than 5 percentage points higher than those at comparable non-HSI colleges, according to <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Latino_Success_Report_Final_HR.pdf\">similar 2017 findings</a> from the nonprofit Education Trust. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12712/transforming-hispanic-serving-institutions-equity-and-justice?srsltid=AfmBOopX2-psJ79B5ryNHaalD0B1Ea3lFXTZN9pplW3C6SzPwYLTHUxp\">There are a few reasons why</a> there is a relatively high graduation rate for Hispanic students at HSIs. </p>\n\n<p>Students at HSIs often report feeling a strong sense of belonging and see their own cultures reflected in the curriculum. Many HSI campuses also offer dedicated programs for first-generation students and train faculty to teach and advise with equity and inclusion in mind.</p>\n\n<p>At University of California, Irvine, where I helped lead HSI initiatives, Hispanic undergraduate enrollment grew by <a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/jan22/a5attach1.pdf\">nearly 150%</a> between 2009 and 2019, from 3,000 students to more than 7,500. </p>\n\n<p>During that time, more than 350 faculty and staff completed <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:f9a482a5-a48c-4425-9e7d-3e29c862f1af\">equity-focused training</a> to strengthen advising and teaching practices that support Hispanic and other underrepresented students.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People hold umbrellas and walk together in the rain near palm trees, in front of a large sign that days Fullerton\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694930/original/file-20251007-56-jw7zsz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Visitors to California State University, Fullerton take a guided campus tour.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/fullerton-ca-visitors-to-cal-state-fullerton-are-on-a-news-photo/1250864058?adppopup=true\">Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What’s at stake for HSIs</h2>\n\n<p>Hispanic Americans now make up nearly <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2024/hispanic-heritage-month.html#:%7E:text=Did%20You%20Know?,Vintage%202023%20Population%20Estimates\">20% of the U.S. population</a>, and their college enrollment numbers are <a href=\"https://excelenciaineducation.medium.com/americas-economic-future-latinos-and-the-institutions-that-serve-them-cfdc13f4f03e\">projected to grow</a> from about 3.7 million in 2020 to 4.5 million by 2030, as overall college enrollment numbers are projected to decline during this time.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED571544.pdf\">national evaluation</a> of Title V projects found that most colleges and universities used these grants to improve student services, develop new academic programs and build community partnerships that help first-generation and low-income students stay enrolled and complete their degrees.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654319864591\">HSI researchers</a> note, graduation rates tell only part of the story.

In the United States, acts of private political violence <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/rising-threat-anti-government-domestic-terrorism-what-data-tells-us\">against members of government</a> and <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/which-groups-have-experienced-an-increase-in-hate-crimes/\">against ordinary people</a> have both increased dramatically in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Political assassinations are the most vivid form of political violence. The Kirk assassination is only the latest example. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An attendee wears a gun on their hip during a candlelight vigil and prayer event at which an American flag is displayed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693944/original/file-20251001-66-8xosll.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An attendee at a candlelight vigil and prayer event for assassinated Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025, in Seattle.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-attendee-wears-a-gun-on-their-hip-during-a-candlelight-news-photo/2234136824?adppopup=true\">David Ryder/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In June 2025, a shooter with a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5353959-minnesota-suspects-hit-list-house-members-state-lawmakers/\">hit list” of left-liberal targets</a> assassinated Minnesota Democratic Rep.

In December 2024, a shooter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/us/luigi-mangione-diary-entries-murder-case\">angry about health insurance costs</a> killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In July 2024, a shooter <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-vp-vance-rubio-7c7ba6b99b5f38d2d840ed95b2fdc3e5\">wounded Trump at a campaign rally</a> in a failed assassination attempt.</p>\n\n<p>Political violence also includes bias-motivated murders. In 2022, a white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/buffalo-supermarket-gunman-to-be-sentenced-to-life-for-racist-attack-killing-10\">murdered 10 Black patrons</a> at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. In 2019, an anti-immigrant racist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/07/texas-walmart-gunman-90-life-sentences-2019\">murdered 23 mostly Latino shoppers</a> at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Texas. In 2018, an antisemite <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html\">murdered 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In those incidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/23/us-mass-killings-extremism-anti-defamation-league\">and numerous others</a>, extreme political ideas appear to have motivated the attackers. The linkage of extremist speech to lethal violence has prompted calls to legally <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol31/iss1/4\">restrict or punish extremist speech</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Political violence, free speech and cultural editing</h2>\n\n<p>The First Amendment, however, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/\">protects extremist speech</a>, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/886/\">including advocacy of violence</a>. Violent rhetoric must <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/\">actually incite</a> or <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/22-138/\">threaten violence</a> to lose the First Amendment’s shelter.</p>\n\n<p>If law cannot curb the sorts of speech that may inspire political violence, what about social norms – widely shared beliefs about what speech is socially acceptable or appropriate?</p>\n\n<p>Much speech that the First Amendment protects from government regulation eventually disappears from public discourse. That happens through a process I call “cultural editing”: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2024.101974\">popular and institutional rejection of outmoded or repellent ideas</a>. For example, no serious medical conference discusses <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2022/04/10-strange-medical-practices-from-history/\">treating hay fever with cocaine</a>, and no respectable political science panel includes Nazis.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yCu21pL73s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=118\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a social media post after Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Donald Trump blamed ‘radical left’ rhetoric for political violence.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s blaming of the Kirk assassination on “radical left” rhetoric points toward a deeper level of cultural editing. </p>\n\n<p>Trump and other conservatives have not cited speech that advocated violence against Kirk. Instead, some conservative activists, spurred on by Trump administration officials, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/jd-vance-doxing-charlie-kirk-critics\">called for harassing and punishing critics</a> of Kirk’s statements and actions. </p>\n\n<p>But such criticisms of Kirk, whatever their merits or lack thereof, fall within the scope of ordinary political debate.  </p>\n\n<p>Kirk was not a government official, but he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/charlie-kirk-republicans-trump-politics.html\">strong influence in the Trump administration</a>. Robust democratic discourse <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/\">requires space for people to criticize</a> such powerful figures. Large-scale cultural editing of those criticisms, amounting to suppression of left-leaning views, would hurt the public’s ability to discuss and resolve political disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>However, Trump and others who push for suppressing harsh political rhetoric might argue that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-believe-harsh-political-rhetoric-is-fueling-violence-reutersipsos-poll-2025-09-16/\">the stakes of verbal attacks have increased</a>. They might say that U.S. political culture can no longer indulge political invective because political violence has become more common. </p>\n\n<h2>Political violence and guns</h2>\n\n<p>That argument for suppressing harsh political speech ignores an independent cause of political violence: gun proliferation.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/report/the-role-of-guns-in-rising-political-violence/\">Most political violence in the U.S. involves guns</a>. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/11/Charlie-Kirk-Trump-political-violence-guns/\">Guns make political violence easier</a> by erasing the distance between extremist ideas and lethal action. Hate or fanaticism can end a life in an instant, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/09/11/how-the-shooting-of-charlie-kirk-unfolded/\">hundreds of yards from the victim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has by far <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gun-ownership-by-country\">the highest number of civilian guns and rate of civilian gun ownership</a> in the world. Since 2008, when <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/\">the Supreme Court declared</a> an individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, annual U.S. gun purchases have increased <a href=\"https://americangunfacts.com/gun-ownership-statistics/\">from about 9 million</a> to <a href=\"https://www.safehome.org/data/firearms-guns-statistics/\">about 16 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Governments often find <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/564/786/\">regulating speech easier</a>, even though less effective, than tackling underlying problems. At times, federal and state governments have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/467528\">addressed political violence by regulating guns</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750656174/the-u-s-once-had-a-ban-on-assault-weapons-why-did-it-expire\">1994 federal assault weapons ban</a> exemplifies regulatory efforts to curb overall gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>But the Supreme Court’s Second Amendment cases <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/\">now appear to bar strong gun regulations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People in a democratic society need freedom to make harsh, even extreme political statements with a minimum of cultural editing. The Second Amendment protects access to lethal weapons. This combination of free speech and gun rights makes the growing problem of political violence much harder to solve.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265223/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gregory P.

You can imagine them as an atomic-scale scaffold filled with nano-sized rooms, each precisely engineered to host certain molecules like guests. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, such as MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity that can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Because chemists can mix and match different metals and organic linkers, there are thousands of possible MOFs – each with unique properties.

MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules.</p>\n\n<p>These features have already inspired potential uses such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">capturing carbon dioxide from the air</a> to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">pulling clean water</a> from humid air, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D4RA04441J\">delivering medicines inside the body</a>. Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr200324t\">for sensing and detection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Atq5z5AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">our team</a> <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/rex-gerald/\">of engineers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz8jKuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">has been developing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iYkrD9IAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN\">MOF-based sensors</a> that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>From a storage material to a sensing material</h2>\n\n<p>When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-chemistryprize2025-1.pdf\">tiny framework changes</a> ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. </p>\n\n<p>By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output.</p>\n\n<p>Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. </p>\n\n<p>This crystal-fiber combination worked as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19775\">a tiny device</a> that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3094092\">picked up these changes</a>, allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. </p>\n\n<p>Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification.</p>\n\n<p>In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371551\">diabetic ketoacidosis</a>, allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695515/original/file-20251009-56-jqsqqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A photo showing a tube-like device, and a person exhaling into it out of their nose.

Ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers.</p>\n\n<p>Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.5c00982\">we developed</a> a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.128608\">allowing it to detect gases</a> with remarkable sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity.</p>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal.</p>\n\n<p>These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors.</p>\n\n<h2>Toward real-world impact</h2>\n\n<p>The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100348\">degrade under humidity or heat</a>, though some research groups are looking into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">how to make them more stable</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b00937\">human breath monitoring</a>, where subtle changes in exhaled gases <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177518\">provide early clues</a> to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers are working to embed MOFs into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">flexible films</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-022-2226-6\">printed circuits and wireless devices</a>. With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale.</p>\n\n<p>If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267103/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jie Huang receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rex Gerald receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bohong Zhang and Chen Zhu do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n\n<p>In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship.</p>\n\n<p>But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBPxHqkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8abR970AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and</a> our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom.</p>\n\n<p>Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"three men drink wine at cafe table with bill on it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/three-men-look-at-a-bill-in-a-cafe-and-divide-royalty-free-image/1312208692\">tim scott/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A focus on what friends give you</h2>\n\n<p>The traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_3\">social exchange theory of friendship</a> views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2008.00499.x\">what kinds of friendships to pursue</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2017.0737\">how to treat your friends</a>. It’s even <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/blog/social-exchange-theory\">made its way into pop psychology</a> self-help spaces.</p>\n\n<p>We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. </p>\n\n<h2>Less accounting, more supporting</h2>\n\n<p>Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216308098798\">likely to support their friends</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075241243341\">what they want in a friend</a>, they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective.</p>\n\n<p>People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met.</p>\n\n<p>Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2023.112120\">ranked higher in importance</a> than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, friendship <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015227414929\">isn’t always positive</a>. Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. </p>\n\n<h2>Friendship is more than the sum of its parts</h2>\n\n<p>But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of <a href=\"https://www.humangenerosity.org/\">The Human Generosity Project</a>, a cross-disciplinary research collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15800-2_4\">across societies</a>, from “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/646235\">kere kere” in Fiji</a> to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.22\">tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda</a>.

People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able.</p>\n\n<p>These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals.</p>\n\n<p>When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">environments are volatile</a> and when they ask those most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.12.003\">likely to be able to help</a>. These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">keeping track of debts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events.</p>\n\n<p>And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges</a> such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">this same pattern</a> in an online study of U.S.-based participants.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">branding cattle</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">paying bills</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat</h2>\n\n<p>What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange.</p>\n\n<p>What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258549/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Athena Aktipis receives funding from the National Science Foundation.

People with too few or defective Treg cells <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12170\">often develop autoimmune diseases</a>, where unchecked immune cells mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues or organs. Yet when Treg cells become too numerous, people can become <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14069\">more susceptible to cancer</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-387827-4.00003-6\">and infections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, Treg cells are often described as a double-edged sword. Treg cells also control internal revolt in the form of an overactive immune response by other immune cells that can trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772\">arthritis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789\">lupus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269\">multiple sclerosis</a> – diseases that develop when Treg cells are defective in either number, function or both.  </p>\n\n<p>The well-established functions of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections have recently been complemented by research unraveling how environmental factors influence these cells and modulate the immune response.</p>\n\n<p>We are a husband-wife team of immunologists who study how environmental factors such as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jJVj3sUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">chemicals, diet and gut bacteria</a> affect Treg cells and the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=af7TahQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">overall functioning of the immune system</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While our study dating back to 1984 found that certain environmental contaminants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008X(84)90261-8\">induce T cells that suppress the immune system</a>, further study on such cells was hampered by an inability in the field at large to isolate and characterize these cells. The discoveries honored by this year’s Nobel Prize transformed how researchers understand the immune system. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Nobel-Prizing winning scientist showing extreme emotion.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695472/original/file-20251009-56-s2rbd6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One of the three Nobel Prize-winning researchers, Mary E.

Some examples of environmental factors include chemical pollutants found in the air and water, microbes, sunlight, diet and medications.   </p>\n\n<p>Rather than being a single, static population, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02716\">Treg cells are highly adaptable</a>. They integrate a variety of environmental cues to either suppress or manage immune responses. They accomplish this by producing key molecules such as FoxP3 that send a signal to other immune cells to stop mounting an aggressive immune response.   </p>\n\n<p>Certain toxic chemicals can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21217849\">increase the number or activity of Treg cells</a>. One of the best-known examples is a group of long-lasting pollutants <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/dioxins\">called dioxins</a> that accumulate in fatty tissues through <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health\">consumption of contaminated meat, dairy and fish</a>. They are produced from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-36903-7_1\">burning waste</a> as well as chemical manufacturing and forest fires.  </p>\n\n<p>The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590813/#\">is a known human carcinogen</a>. Researchers have linked exposure to this chemical to various health problems, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304426\">including cancer</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2016.07.007\">reproductive and developmental issues</a>. Research shows that dioxins <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2008.63\">activate Treg cells</a> through a sensor known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1421346\">aryl hydrocarbon receptor</a>. This constitutes one of the mechanisms through which certain environmental chemicals promote cancer by enhancing Treg activity and suppressing the anti-cancer immune response.  </p>\n\n<p>Air pollution, such as diesel exhaust, can have the opposite effect, impairing Treg cell function and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.08.008\">contributing to inflammatory diseases such as asthma</a>.

Compounds known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-023-03031-4\">indoles, found in vegetables from the cabbage family</a> such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1501727\">can activate Treg cells and help prevent gut inflammation</a>. These compounds also work by stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which boosts Treg numbers and activity. </p>\n\n<p>Another way diet can influence Treg cells is through the regulation of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hangry-bacteria-in-your-gut-microbiome-are-linked-to-chronic-disease-feeding-them-what-they-need-could-lead-to-happier-cells-and-a-healthier-body-199486\">the microbes that live in the gut</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms16047493\">gut has trillions of microbial residents, both benefical and harmful</a>. Previous research found that Treg cells in the gut <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.600973\">play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis</a> – the dynamic balance between microbiota and immune cells found in the gut. Any disturbance leading to loss of Treg cell function can lead to hyperactivation of other immune cells in the gut. This can trigger <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">inflammation</a> in which the immune cells destroy the lining of the intestine, leading to conditions such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8813558\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other naturally occurring substances – such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02267\">naringenin</a>, a chemical abundant in citrus fruits, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2011.04.009\">epigallocatechin-3-gallate</a>, a compound found in green tea – also activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote Treg development.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fiber-is-your-bodys-natural-guide-to-weight-management-rather-than-cutting-carbs-out-of-your-diet-eat-them-in-their-original-fiber-packaging-instead-205159\">fiber-rich diet</a> supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This bacteria ferments fiber into <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-019-00057-5#\">short-chain fatty acids that enhance Treg cell function</a> and help maintain gut health. Probiotic bacteria also increases Treg cell populations, thereby reducing inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, dietary tryptophan – an amino acid found in foods such as poultry, eggs, tofu and seeds – is metabolized into compounds that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092846\">activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor</a>, further boosting Treg cell activity and protecting against gut inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, a Western diet high in fat, sugar and processed foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2024.101923\">disrupts the balance of gut bacteria</a>. This, in turn, reduces the population of microbes that support Treg cells and promotes a more inflammatory environment in the gut.</p>\n\n<h2>Keeping Treg cells in harmony</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists like us and many others are working to understand the processes involved in maintaining the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06880\">delicate balance of Treg cells</a> that are influenced by all of these outside factors. The goal is to learn how Treg cells and other immune cells can be kept in equilibrium – strong enough to defend against infections and cancer yet restrained enough to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. </p>\n\n<p>The profound environmental influence on Treg cell development and function makes understanding these interactions crucial for defining the fine line between health and disease.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266865/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Prakash Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.  </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mitzi Nagarkatti receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p>",

Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death.</p>\n\n<p>While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What to expect this flu season</h2>\n\n<p>Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see <a href=\"https://www.idse.net/Influenza/Article/10-25/CDC-Classifies-Upcoming-Flu-Season-as-Moderate-but-Vaccination-Still-Key/78478\">a moderate level of flu cases</a>, partly because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.17484\">last year’s flu activity was high</a> and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. </p>\n\n<p>However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been <a href=\"https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/worrying-signs-as-peak-flu-season-draws-near\">more severe than in years past</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm\">children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. <a href=\"https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/articles/antigenic-drift-vs-antigenic-shift-311044\">Because flu viruses mutate frequently</a>, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/influenza-inactivated.html\">best protection against severe illness</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html\">will be trivalent</a> – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A family, mom, dad and two young children all sit in bed together blowing their noses.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=354&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695495/original/file-20251009-56-7658lh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=445&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/sick-flu-and-family-on-a-bed-tissue-and-blowing-royalty-free-image/1575862747\">Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Vaccine availability</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-will-approve-covid-19-vaccine-only-for-older-adults-and-high-risk-groups-a-public-health-expert-explains-the-new-rules-257226\">Recent vaccine policy changes</a> have created some confusion, particularly around <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-with-new-restrictions-potentially-limiting-access-for-healthy-children-264098\">COVID-19 vaccines</a>. Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost.</p>\n\n<p>The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu-vaccination/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot-this-year\">cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor</a> for the flu by about half.</p>\n\n<p>Vaccination helps <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.004\">reduce the severity of illness</a>, the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html\">at the same time as other vaccines</a>, such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status.</p>\n\n<h2>Who should get the flu shot</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html\">everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year</a>, with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073620\">the American Association of Pediatrics</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The flu vaccine is especially important for:</p>\n\n<p>• Adults 65 and older</p>\n\n<p>• Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2</p>\n\n<p>• Pregnant people</p>\n\n<p>• People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease</p>\n\n<p>• Health care workers and caregivers</p>\n\n<p>Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated <a href=\"https://www.renown.org/blog/slow-the-spread-of-the-flu-with-herd-immunity\">protects not only you but also those around you</a> who may be more vulnerable.</p>\n\n<h2>Practical prevention tips</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses:</p>\n\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.nfid.org/washyourhands-to-help-prevent-disease/\">Wash your hands frequently</a> with soap and water. </p>\n\n<p>• Cover your coughs and sneezes.</p>\n\n<p>• Stay home if you’re feeling unwell.</p>\n\n<p>• Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough.</p>\n\n<p>Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-should-you-get-the-new-covid-19-booster-and-the-flu-shot-now-is-the-right-time-for-both-190826\">getting vaccinated</a> and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy.  </p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html\">now’s the time</a> to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267058/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Libby Richards has received funding from the American Nurses Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute . </span></em></p>",

I have written a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83078-6\">textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders</a>, and, more recently, a self-help book for <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooBA1XtZ9Uea0tv2baj9t8v7TXnaPW7WBf21RqvKUM-imc32kzO\">people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019\">food addiction is a real phenomenon</a>. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70338\">certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed</a> – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes25053\">affect the brains and behavior</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83116-0\">of certain people</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112574\">similarly to other addictive substances</a> such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">nicotine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction.</p>\n\n<h2>How does addiction work?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597351/\">neurobiological mechanisms of addiction</a> have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.010\">preexisting genetic</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000870\">environmental factors</a> set the stage for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00034-y\">developing an addiction</a>. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">important brain systems</a>, leading the person to crave more and more of it.</p>\n\n<p>This rewiring takes place in <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOopjx6BZgKuKhvAdGDFBjZPHVbZiJSDRThQXyEsSsw4nYc1i8iV7\">three key brain networks</a> that correspond to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024\">key functional domains</a>, often referred to as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.011\">reward system</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.038\">the stress response system</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2013-0054\">the system in charge of executive control</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine\">called dopamine</a> in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0191-4\">neurobiological process called conditioning</a>, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00264\">increasing influence over decision-making and behavior</a>, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. </p>\n\n<p>Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience <a href=\"https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments\">symptoms of withdrawal</a>, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. </p>\n\n<p>At that point, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_288\">negative reinforcement kicks in</a>. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief.</p>\n\n<p>Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex\">prefrontal cortex</a>, and other key parts of the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010654108\">involved in impulse control and self-regulation</a>. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZ5LH634W8s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What evidence is there that food is addictive?</h2>\n\n<p>Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22639\">high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods</a> – often foods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762\">that are ultraprocessed</a> – act on these brain networks in ways that are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/foods-high-in-added-fats-and-refined-carbs-are-like-cigarettes-addictive-and-unhealthy-165441\">similar to other addictive substances</a>. The resulting changes in the brain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008\">fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance</a> – in this case, highly rewarding food.</p>\n\n<p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065\">hallmark signs of a substance use disorder</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.071\">predicts weight gain</a>.

But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, eating disorders such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615\">bulimia nervosa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627\">binge-eating disorder</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00411-0\">often occur alongside addictive eating</a>. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">excessive dietary restriction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937\">binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A way forward</h2>\n\n<p>But others argue that, with care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16132019\">integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment</a> is feasible and could be lifesaving for some.</p>\n\n<p>The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-024-01017-9\">consider food addiction in their treatment models</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One such approach might look like <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooIfW4_BgKGysr2y90Cts7qyqjoKdpF5HIxXAiNMPY7rRHDYKI3\">the one described to me</a> by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Additional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1556988\">clinical studies</a> are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2024.107211\">already being carried out</a>. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1542905\">are underway</a> by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1159/000527322\">into future editions of diagnostic manuals</a> such as the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases\">World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261727/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have two books for sale which address food addiction, and I could benefit financially from increased interest in the food addiction topic:\n\nWilcox C.E.

And the reality on the ground suggests that the two countries are still far from sealing any deal to end the Israeli military incursions into Syrian territory that have occurred since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024. Just days after the American official gave his prognosis and as negotiations continued, Israel <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/28/middleeast/israel-syria-normalization-strikes-intl\">struck several Syrian targets</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Citing negotiation sources, several news outlets reported that the delay in securing a deal was primarily related to Israel’s 11th-hour demand of creating a so-called <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-09-28/ty-article/.premium/israel-seeks-humanitarian-corridor-of-influence-in-syria-threatening-regime-stability/00000199-8cf4-dbe0-af9d-9ef5d6a00000\">humanitarian corridor</a> that would link the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israeli-occupied Golan Heights</a> to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-druze-are-a-tightly-knit-community-and-the-violence-in-syria-is-triggering-fears-in-lebanon-261931\">Sweidah, a city in southern Syria</a>. Israel said the purpose is to protect religious minorities in the Golan Heights and Sweidah. </p>\n\n<p>The hitch, after months of U.S.-mediated talks, reflects Syria’s vulnerability in these negotiations. Seeking to move on after year of war, the current Syrian leadership is eager to snuff out remaining internal violence, secure the borders and return to the United Nations-brokered truce with Israel that had been in place for decades. However, concluding a deal with its militarily superior neighbor risks the further fragmentation of Syria and an entrenched violation of its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, as an <a href=\"https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=rebeizm\">expert on the Middle East</a>, I believe the talks and the potential last-minute snag point to Israel believing it has the upper hand. Meanwhile for Syria, a desire for security can’t mask what it sees as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria-israelpalestine/how-israels-overreach-syria-may-backfire\">Israel’s expansionist policy in the region</a>, and concerns that it is using things like a proposed humanitarian corridor as a way to achieve recognition of areas only recently under Israeli control.</p>\n\n<h2>The fraught history of Syrian-Israeli relations</h2>\n\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/history/\">United Nations’ partition of Palestine in 1947</a> and the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/war-for-palestine/israel-and-the-arab-coalition-in-1948/DEAE4004B3CD32F1C5EFE7A85B56003D\">a coalition of five Arab armies</a>, including Syria, declared war on Israel and lost the ensuing conflict. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Soldiers stand by barbed-wire fences.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695107/original/file-20251008-66-8abtut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Israeli soldiers stand guard as Syrian Druze people cross back into Syria at the Israeli-Syrian border in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IsraelSyriaClashes/29bdf7af42eb47b5ba4e678dfaccd83f/photo\">AP Photo/Leo Correa</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As a result, Syria was forced to sign an <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/il20sy490720israeli-syrian20general20armistice20agreement.pdf\">armistice agreement</a> with Israel on July 20, 1949. </p>\n\n<p>Yet de facto peace never lasted long. The two countries squared off in repeated conflicts in the next 25 years, including the Six-Day War in 1967 that launched <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/deadly-strike-in-the-golan-heights-risks-opening-new-front-in-long-disputed-territory-235731\">Israel’s still-ongoing occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1974, the U.N. brokered the <a href=\"https://undof.unmissions.org/background\">Agreement on Disengagement</a> between Israeli and Syrian forces. While not a peace agreement, the pact served to codify a ceasefire and created a buffer zone between the two countries monitored by U.N. observers.</p>\n\n<p>For 50 years, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/16/world/israel-syria-talks-overview-syria-israel-begin-peace-talks-after-4-year-halt.html\">that status quo held uneasily</a>, as <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/madrid-conference\">subsequent peace efforts failed</a>. The conflict was effectively frozen, punctuated by occasional flare-ups of violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Entering the post-Assad era</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/\">fall of Assad and his goverment</a> in December 2024 suddenly injected a new dose of uncertainty into Israel-Syria relations.</p>\n\n<p>As rebel-turned interim President <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> worked to consolidate power and vowed to restore peace and stability for his war-torn country, Israel went on the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the collapse of the Assad government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement “<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-slams-violation-of-1974-disengagement-deal-as-israel-acts-in-syria-buffer-zone/\">void until order is restored in Syria</a>.” As a result, and in violation of the agreement, Israel occupied the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights and expanded its control inside Syria. For months, Israel has conducted a campaign <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/4/mapping-israels-expanding-air-attacks-across-syria\">of airstrikes across Syria</a>, repeatedly bombing Syrian military positions, including near the presidential palace in Damascus. Israel says it is doing so to stop weapon transfers from Iran and to protect its borders and ensure its security. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/\">it has pressed the U.S. to keep Syria weak and divided</a>, in part due to Netanyahu’s and his far-right coalition’s hostility to an Islamist-governed neighbor. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S., at the urging of allies like Saudi Arabia which are close with the Sharaa government, recently lifted sanctions on Syria. For months, officials of the Trump administration have likewise mediated talks and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/under-us-pressure-syria-israel-inch-toward-security-deal-2025-09-16/\">pushed Israel and Syria to conclude an agreement</a> to stop Israel’s seizures and air campaign. </p>\n\n<p>For his part, Sharaa and his negotiators have continually pressed for a halt to Israeli incursions and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/at-un-syrias-sharaa-slams-israeli-attacks-commits-to-1974-disengagement-seeks-dialogue/\">a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement</a> and the de facto borders it established, describing it as a “necessity.” </p>\n\n<h2>Hints of common ground on Hezbollah and Iran</h2>\n\n<p>Aside from Syria’s immediate desire and chief priority to end all hostilities on its territory, there are some potential benefits to a new arrangement with Israel from both countries’ perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Before its fall, the Assad government was close to Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/does-hezbollah-represent-lebanon-and-what-impact-will-the-death-of-longtime-leader-hassan-nasrallah-have-240062\">Hezbollah</a>, a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group funded by Iran, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/assads-fall-in-syria-will-further-weaken-hezbollah-and-curtails-tehrans-iranization-of-region-245606\">supported Assad and played a major role in Syria’s civil war</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, under Assad’s government, Syria served as a land bridge between Iran and Lebanon through which Hezbollah fighters transported their <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/03/double-dealers-lebanon-and-the-risks-of-captagon-trafficking?lang=en\">military equipment, money and drugs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Under Sharaa, Syria’s central government is now closely allied to the Arab Gulf countries that have long been Iran’s regional rivals. In strengthening its security, Syria will no longer serve as Hezbollah-Iran meeting point, which will subsequently benefit Israel. For Syria, it will also stabilize the country against Iranian interference. </p>\n\n<h2>The risk of Syria’s further fragmentation</h2>\n\n<p>The risks of a deal with Israel from Syria’s standpoint, however, are significant.</p>\n\n<p>In defending its incursions into Syria, Israel has pointed to both the security threat it says Syria poses to Israel and also the situation of minority groups in Syria, where sectarian violence has risen against communities like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79q8p8qx1do\">Christian Orthodox</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/08/syria-un-experts-alarmed-attacks-druze-communities-including-sexual-violence\">Druze</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel has floated a number of plans for how it intends to retain a heavy footprint in Syria beyond the occupation of the Golan Heights and the 1974 Agreement of Disengagement. </p>\n\n<p>One option on the table is an extension of the historical buffer zone and splitting Syria into autonomous zones, <a href=\"https://www.dohainstitute.org/en/PoliticalStudies/Pages/proposed-syria-israel-security-agreement-provisions-and-prospects.aspx\">in which Sweidah province</a> would be a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria. With the most recent idea of a humanitarian corridor couched in the language of protecting Syrian minorities, Israel could be seeking a wider area under more explicit control. </p>\n\n<p>From the Syrian perspective, all of the above are backdoor ways by Israel to cement post-Assad military actions beyond the scope of the 1974 truce. As such, agreement to a security pact on Israeli terms would mean jeopardizing or shrinking Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Demonstrators hold up flags.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695105/original/file-20251008-66-434nq1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Syrian protesters gather in front of Damascus Citadel to denounce Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip and to oppose any potential agreement that would lead to normalization of relations with Israel.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/protesters-gather-in-front-of-damascus-citadel-to-denounce-news-photo/2236488646?adppopup=true\">Hasan Belal/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The Syrian leadership’s challenge going forward</h2>\n\n<p>After years of war and fragmentation, most Syrians will take any cessation of hostilities with Israel as a welcome development – but not at any cost. Many Syrians are <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/analysis/federalism-or-fragmentation-future-syrias-minorities\">opposed to further fragmentation of the country</a>. And considering the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">killing and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza</a> – described recently <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">by a U.N. body as genocide</a> – and Syria’s historic commitment to pan-Arabism, many Syrians will likely be skeptical if a security deal with Israel means a de facto recognition of the land and sovereignty Israel has acquired since December 2024. </p>\n\n<p>That points to the major dilemma underpinning Sharaa’s position. Syria is in a vulnerable place and is not in position to negotiate from strength, especially as Sharaa tries to open Syria to the Western world, boost its economy and bring back the civil war refugees from neighboring countries. Seeking to consolidate his government’s hold on power and end the presence of a foreign military, Sharaa likely sees a security agreement as in his immediate interest.</p>\n\n<p>While such a pact may bring some stability to Syria and the region, it could also codify Israel’s nearly unchallenged regional power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265785/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mireille Rebeiz is affiliated with the American Red Cross. </span></em></p>",

Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images </a></span></figcaption></figure><p>On a recent early fall morning, hope was in short supply. </p>\n\n<p>My first patient was a regular. Mr. D was a man in his 50s with diabetes. He had been living on Denver’s streets for most of the past five years, two of them with a walker in tow. Without stable housing and reliable access to insulin, he’d come to the hospital that morning with another limb-threatening infection. </p>\n\n<p>I examined the telltale ulceration on the sole of his foot. It had progressed to the underlying bone and would require another amputation. This time he would be dependent on a wheelchair. I asked him about his prospects for housing. He shook his head and said, “Doc, I just keep falling through the cracks.”  </p>\n\n<p>Mr. D is one of the <a href=\"https://www.mdhi.org/pit\">10,774 people who experienced homelessness</a> on a single night in 2025 across metro Denver, according to a count conducted by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative and partner organizations. Of these, 35% were <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coc-esg-virtual-binders/coc-esg-homeless-eligibility/definition-of-chronic-homelessness/\">experiencing a chronic</a> form of homelessness. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man kneels with a cell phone in his hand next to a person who is sitting and holding a cane.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694140/original/file-20251002-66-16pjsa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Each year, homeless service organizations count how many people are experiencing homelessness on one night in January. The count helps service providers and government entities understand the trends and needs of people experiencing homelessness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/volunteer-paul-benevides-veterans-specialist-with-the-news-photo/912294318?adppopup=true\">Joe Amon/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/6779\">an internal medicine physician</a> whose focus is caring for hospitalized patients, my experience suggests that this count is too low. People in hospitals and other institutional settings the day of the survey are not reflected in these numbers. Others are hard to spot, staying out of sight on couches or in creek beds, or hiding in plain sight while they serve our food or fix our roads. For these reasons, point-in-time counts <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/many-more-denver-teens-have-experienced-homelessness-than-official-counts-show-249997\">underestimate the true prevalence of homelessness</a> in the city.   </p>\n\n<p>I work at <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/about-denver-health\">Denver Health</a>, the region’s comprehensive safety net health system, where I’m on the front lines of Denver’s homelessness crisis. My perspectives on this issue have been shaped by nearly two decades of experience caring for some of the city’s most vulnerable patients.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve helped create and oversee hospital partnerships that help people like Mr. D find housing. But <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">recent federal actions</a> will only worsen homelessness and weaken the response to it in Colorado and across the nation.   </p>\n\n<h2>Falling through the cracks</h2>\n\n<p>When people like Mr. D fall through the cracks, my colleagues and I are there to catch them. In 2024, Denver Health served <a href=\"https://www.denverhealth.org/-/media/files/about/annual-reports/Report%20to%20the%20City%202024%20Digital%20Final\">more than 16,000 patients experiencing homelessness</a> who collectively had 78,000 visits to the integrated health system. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve watched these cracks widen as Colorado has become one of the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap#summary-table\">least affordable places in the country to live</a>. According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 2025 a Coloradan can work more than 80 hours per week and <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/oor\">still be unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment</a>. This means that housing is woefully out of reach for many of my patients.  </p>\n\n<p>As physicians, we are trained to address the root causes of the diseases we treat. I care for elderly patients who are newly homeless following an eviction, as well as homeless veterans and Lyft drivers who sleep in their vehicles. Though their individual circumstances vary — loss of job or a loved one, an illness or a battle with addiction — the root cause of their homelessness is the same: a lack of affordable and available housing. </p>\n\n<p>Because of an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.0820\">increased prevalence of serious health conditions and structural barriers</a> – such as marginalization and discrimination – that prevent equitable access to primary and preventive health care, people experiencing homelessness often rely on hospitals like ours for care. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, roughly 1 in 6 adults admitted to Denver Health’s hospital for an illness or injury were experiencing homelessness, according to internal data. Like Mr. D, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.52163\">many are aging</a> and have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnw011\">cognitive and mobility impairments</a>, along with the frailty characteristic of much older patients.</p>\n\n<p>Those <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/unsheltered-homelessness/\">living unsheltered</a> suffer preventable harms such as frostbite and heatstroke in Colorado’s climate of extremes. And for many, homelessness is lethal. Last year at least <a href=\"https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/Medical-Examiner/Medical-Examiner-Data#section-6\">223 people</a> died while living on Denver’s streets. </p>\n\n<p>At Denver Health, homeless adults who are admitted to the hospital stay on average 2.4 days longer than housed patients, translating into 5,400 excess hospital days for Denver residents alone, according to internal data. And without a safe place to recover, they have significantly higher readmission rates.  </p>\n\n<p>Evidence of the negative impacts of homelessness on health and hospital resources is so compelling that <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/\">the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a> has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09136-4\">recognized homelessness as a comorbid condition</a>. This designation gives homelessness a similar weight to chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing the needless suffering brought about by patients’ lack of housing and feeling powerless to stop it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-025-09690-5\">contributes to moral injury</a> among health care providers. Moral injury refers to the psychological and emotional wounds that occur when one witnesses events that violate their moral and ethical beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve certainly recognized these feelings in myself or in colleagues who’ve been at the bedside with me all these years. To me, treating the symptoms of homelessness without addressing the underlying cause feels like treating a gunshot wound with a Band-Aid.</p>\n\n<h2>Cure for homelessness</h2>\n\n<p>But unlike many of the conditions I treat, homelessness does have a cure. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put, it’s deeply affordable and supportive housing. Evidence shows that <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487\">Housing First</a> – an approach that prioritizes housing as a critical foundation for engagement in health care services – results in high rates of housing stability and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.01041\">brings down high-cost health care utilization</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman sits in front of a hotel window next to a bike.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694143/original/file-20251002-56-pabcdp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Roberta Ramirez stays at the Aspen, a noncongregate homelessness shelter in Denver.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/roberta-ramirez-stays-at-the-aspens-non-congregate-news-photo/2144486536?adppopup=true\">Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet many of the patients I treat, as one of my colleagues likes to say, “will never darken the door of a homeless service agency.” </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, only <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08909-1\">53% of patients on our health system’s homeless registry</a> were using homeless services in the community. In a cruel irony, the chaos of homelessness that forces people to prioritize survival, combined with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2022.2058580\">health conditions such as physical disabilities, dementia or serious mental illness</a>, often collude to prevent patients from engaging with the very systems that could end their homelessness. Sometimes, like Mr. D, they give up trying.</p>\n\n<p>This creates the heartbreaking situations I see in my daily work. Too often the patients with the greatest health care needs and vulnerability are the most underserved. </p>\n\n<p>Over time, I’ve learned that improving health inside the hospital walls increasingly means working beyond them to build collaborations to address the myriad ways our systems are failing patients like Mr. D.  </p>\n\n<h2>Housing and health partnerships</h2>\n\n<p>In Denver some progress has been made. In 2023 <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/newly-minted-denver-mayor-mike-johnston-issues-emergency-declaration-over-homelessness\">Mayor Mike Johnston issued an emergency declaration on homelessness</a>.

The hospital now leases 14 apartments that it makes available to provide temporary housing and case management to elderly or disabled patients experiencing homelessness following a hospitalization. Most of the 39 patients who have been housed there have attained more permanent housing, according to internal data.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOUxA8qiCcQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A 9News report on the office building converted into affordable housing in Denver.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Denver Health also partners on <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/denver-housing-health-project-housing-stability-payment-outcomes-second-report\">Denver’s Housing to Health Program</a>, a permanent supportive housing program launched in 2022 that aims to reduce health care expenditures for people experiencing chronic homelessness. A hospital team identifies eligible patients and provides “warm handoffs” to directly connect them with the program’s housing service providers during hospitalizations or emergency room visits. While the evaluation is ongoing, it’s a <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/harnessing-health-care-systems-enhance-supportive-housing\">promising partnership model</a> for how hospitals might collaborate to address homelessness.</p>\n\n<h2>Impact of federal policies and funding cuts</h2>\n\n<p>With accompanying investments in proven solutions to homelessness, such partnerships have the potential to deliver better care at lower cost. </p>\n\n<p>Actions taken by the federal government in 2025 that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/\">criminalize people experiencing homelessness, defund Housing First initiatives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/summary/00\">dismantle Medicaid and other essential benefits</a> threaten these partnerships and our progress. These policies will worsen homelessness, and patients will continue to be “housed” in the least appropriate and most expensive way – in the hospital. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to harming patients, this trend is not sustainable for safety net hospitals like Denver Health that already <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/29/denver-health-medicaid-sales-tax/\">provide millions of dollars annually in uncompensated care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a physician working at the intersection of housing and health, I believe hospitals are key partners in the fight to end homelessness. I’ve observed the hopelessness that homelessness can bring. But I’ve also seen how the right partnerships can transform a routine hospitalization into an unexpected opportunity for meaningful connection that puts patients on the path to housing and health. </p>\n\n<p>Now when I see patients like Mr. D, I see possibility rather than another dead end for them. After all, for all their adversity, my patients’ stories are also stories of beauty, strength and resilience. While the “cracks” keep me up at night, their stories, and the partnerships we’ve created, bring me hope at a time when hope seems in short supply. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Patient initials and other identifying details have been changed to protect confidentiality.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/local\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261234/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sarah A.

Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/csb-releases-final-report-on-2019-massive-tank-farm-fire-at-the-intercontinental-terminals-company-facility-in-deer-park-texas/\">more than 70 million gallons of petroleum</a> products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/intercontinental-terminals-company-pay-over-66-million-injuries-natural-resources-resulting\">determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines</a>. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1386420.015\">no reason to investigate further</a> or impose fines or other penalties on the company.</p>\n\n<p>A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/mission/\">seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents</a>. It’s an approach much like the <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process/Pages/default.aspx\">National Transportation Safety Board</a> takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/\">prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That deep investigative process <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">reportedly will not happen</a> in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/chevrons-el-segundo-refinery-had-a-history-of-safety-environmental-violations\">October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery</a> in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/ehs/phdstudents/steenstra-philip.html\">scholars</a> of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZieRajIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">chemical</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3QFImkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">disasters</a>, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget</a> – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A fire at several large round buildings sends dark black smoke into the sky.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694945/original/file-20251007-56-qyrumv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=499&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A fire burns at Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Petrochemical-Fire-Texas/0164e16ea5d34ed4afb24146e1e3931d/photo\">AP Photo/David J.

They included necessary updates to safety management systems, <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/itc_report_-_final_(july_6,_2023).pdf\">the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks</a>, and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/?F_InvestigationId=3602\">reportedly working on the next two</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_ripe_study_finalv.pdf\">storage tanks be spaced farther apart</a> so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review.</p>\n\n<p>And the Texas fire was just <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/investigations/completed-investigations/?F_FromDate=1/1/2019&amp;F_ToDate=12/31/2019\">one of several disasters</a> the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">investigations of 102 chemical disasters</a> in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_strategic_plan11.pdf\">France, South Korea and China</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ReYsPKwVy64?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board video summarizes the agency’s findings about a March 2019 petrochemical terminal fire in Texas.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Creation and goals of the CSB</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/history/\">created by Congress in a 1990 amendment</a> to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Those included the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.051\">1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy</a>, which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in <a href=\"https://origins.osu.edu/read/bhopal-chemical-gas-disaster\">Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate</a> from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident\">Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster</a> in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">prevent similar accidents from occurring</a> on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically designed to be <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/chemical-safety-and-hazard-investigation-board\">independent of other organizations and political influence</a>, the CSB <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/1630/text\">cannot be forced to modify its findings</a> by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality. </p>\n\n<p>It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/statistics/\">recommendations are adopted by the industries affected</a>, usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"LWgds\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LWgds/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What does the board do?</h2>\n\n<p>There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-VI/part-1604\">releases of particular chemicals</a>, such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride.</p>\n\n<p>The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded.</p>\n\n<p>After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry.</p>\n\n<h2>The board’s value</h2>\n\n<p>The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\">more than $6 trillion</a> the U.S. government spends each year.</p>\n\n<p>The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_cj_2026.pdf\">capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA</a>. But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the CSB has <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/public-comments/\">helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations</a>, such as for the <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_epa_rcra_comment_letter_5-14-2024_(004).pdf\">open burning of waste explosives</a>, and improved methods of <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_comments_epa-hq-oem-2015-0725_51020161.pdf\">investigating accidental chemical releases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/assets/1/6/csb_osha_emergency_response_comment_letter_7-12-2024.pdf\">implementing new emergency response rules</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265546/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.lifeofthomaspain00lint/?st=gallery\">one of America’s founders</a>, laughing louder than anybody. </p>\n\n<p>That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/16/the-sharpened-quill\">titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. </p>\n\n<p>Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/american-enlightenment-thought/\">underrated American pastime</a>, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” </p>\n\n<p>I could go on. Because he did. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A yellowed copy of a short publication with the title 'Common Sense.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=485&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694872/original/file-20251007-56-l41ch3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Published in 1776, Thomas Paine’s pamphlet ‘Common Sense’ inveighed against monarchy and hereditary privilege and in favor of independence for the Colonies.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.si.edu/collections/snapshot/eloquent-argument\">Smithsonian National Museum of American History</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Birth of a revolutionary</h2>\n\n<p>Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine\">small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737</a>. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, <a href=\"https://www.laits.utexas.edu/gov310/CF/Paine_Sense/index.html\">met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London</a>, sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical.  </p>\n\n<p>Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">renounced, repudiated and ridiculed</a> at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/PaineRightsOfMan/mode/2up\">Hereditary privilege, colonialism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.ageofreason00pain_0/?st=gallery\">the supernatural</a>: no, no, no. </p>\n\n<p>But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery\">were kings</a>. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1776ThomasPaine.pdf\">Common Sense,” his first major work</a>, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694951/original/file-20251007-56-zkg03b.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lawn signs that quote 'No King!

It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” </p>\n\n<p>Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. </p>\n\n<p>“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.</p>\n\n<h2>Bring the Paine</h2>\n\n<p>The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.</p>\n\n<p>This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A somewhat puckish-looking middle-aged man from the 18th century, holding a\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694875/original/file-20251007-56-4cic5r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1071&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A somewhat puckish-looking Thomas Paine – with the wrong first name and a different spelling of his last one.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://npg.si.edu/exhibit/paine/pop-ups/01-01.html\">National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.</p>\n\n<p>“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/\">Federal worker firings</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006\">court settlements</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025\">a government shutdown</a>. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.</p>\n\n<p>Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. </p>\n\n<p>The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.   </p>\n\n<p>Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Matthew Redmond does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, the framework explicitly states that Hamas must be excised from any future discussions of postwar Gaza. Moreover, no other Palestinian group has any direct involvement; Hamas’ main rival Fatah – the party that is in control of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank – is only briefly mentioned. As for that Palestinian Authority, there is only a vague line about reforming the body.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been no mention of what the Palestinian people might actually want. In this way, the body being proposed recalls the creation of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority during the invasion of Iraq. That body governed Iraq immediately following the invasion and was <a href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/11/02/failures_of_the_coalition_provisional_authority_in_iraq_112574.html\">criticized for corruption and lack of transparency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The failure of the Iraq War, and the U.K.’s involvement in it, contributed to Blair’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/10/tonyblair.labour\">resignation as prime minister</a> in 2007, after which he took on the role of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/the-quartet/\">special envoy to the Quartet</a>. Led by the U.N., U.S., EU and Russia, the Quartet was tasked with preserving some form of the two-state solution and implementing economic development plans in Palestinian cities. </p>\n\n<p>But it, too, failed to address the changing political realities on the ground as <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/israeli-settlements/\">Israeli settlements expanded</a> and the military occupation deepened.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying assumption about the Quartet, critics contend, is that it largely ignored the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty; rather, it focused on marginally improving economic conditions and Band-Aid initiatives. </p>\n\n<p>The latest U.S.-backed proposal cribs heavily from the approach. Even if it does bring about a welcome respite from the suffering in Gaza in the short term, I believe a durable, mutually agreed upon resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires what Trump’s plan sidelines: Palestinian self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>In Northern Ireland, Blair once understood the importance of neutral mediation and the buy-in of all parties to the conflict and the people themselves. The plan he is involved with now appears to be operating with a far different calculus.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266742/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dana El Kurd is affiliated with the Arab Center Washington. </span></em></p>",

These are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZaHhxJEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">I’m a MOF scientist</a> and for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me.</p>\n\n<h2>So, what exactly are MOFs?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern.

In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests.</p>\n\n<h2>Why scientists love them</h2>\n\n<p>What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space.

Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m91P-R3kxOs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So far, scientists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17755-8\">synthesized over 90,000 MOFs</a>, and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. </p>\n\n<p>Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01650\">isoreticular MOFs</a>. These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture.</p>\n\n<h2>Pushing the boundaries of these materials</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses.</p>\n\n<p>Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr2003272\">capturing carbon dioxide</a> from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">clean polluted water</a> by removing heavy metals, dyes or “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-pfas-the-forever-chemicals-showing-up-in-drinking-water-an-environmental-health-scientist-explains-185015\">forever chemicals</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.200601878\">for medical applications</a>. In the energy world, they function <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214715\">as electrodes or electrolytes</a> that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr9003924\">serve as catalysts</a>, accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. </p>\n\n<p>When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja903726m\">named MIL-125</a>. It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Demos_Techniques_and_Experiments/General_Lab_Techniques/Proper_Use_of_a_Desiccator\">no desiccator</a> – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench.</p>\n\n<p>That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">withstand water, heat and repeated use</a>. Since their foundation, researchers around the world have <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/materials/metal-organic-frameworks/conductive-MOFs-electrocatalyst-sensors/99/i43\">introduced new properties to these materials</a> – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. </p>\n\n<p>Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">clean water straight from desert air</a>, to building more <a href=\"https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/cooling-homes-without-warming-the-planet/\">energy-efficient air conditioners</a>. What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world.</p>\n\n<h2>A Nobel moment that honors creativity</h2>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/press-release/\">honoring three remarkable scientists</a> – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies.</p>\n\n<p>When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in <a href=\"https://kampouri.blogs.rice.edu/\">my own research group</a>, we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this Nobel Prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: Chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267089/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stavroula (Alina) Kampouri receives research funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF) and other public research agencies.</span></em></p>",

Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/\">Nobel Prize in physics</a> was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a physicist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=q1_eBhsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies superconducting circuits</a> for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted.</p>\n\n<h2>Big, cold, quantum</h2>\n\n<p>In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/profile/john-martinis/\">John Martinis</a>, then-postdoctoral researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2CeGqLAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Michel Devoret</a> and UC Berkeley professor <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R7uhrOoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works\">John Clarke</a> showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-do-superconductors-work-a-physicist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-resistance-free-electricity-202308\">superconductors</a>. A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. </p>\n\n<p>Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. </p>\n\n<p>Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"four parallel brass-colored rings connected by vertical tubes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/AFMC-News/Article/2470321/afrl-measures-first-superconducting-quantum-bits-qubit-first-ever-demo-for-a-do/\">U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.014021\">near-ideal microwave amplifier</a> based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8654\">emulate a group of electron-like particles</a>. This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. </p>\n\n<p>In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58947-4\">demonstrate a protocol</a> for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. </p>\n\n<p>But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing.</p>\n\n<h2>Superconducting quantum computers</h2>\n\n<p>Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-entanglement-a-physicist-explains-the-science-of-einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-191927\">entangled</a>, so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. </p>\n\n<p>In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them.</p>\n\n<p>Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else.</p>\n\n<p>The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, academic research groups <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/lfl/\">like mine</a> develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118297/ibm-large-scale-error-corrected-quantum-computer-by-2028/\">create large-scale quantum processors</a> for practical use. </p>\n\n<h2>Superconductor pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has <a href=\"https://qolab.ai/\">his own company</a>, while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. </p>\n\n<p>I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. </p>\n\n<p>Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266979/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Levenson-Falk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They allege that the president has it out for Comey, who investigated <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-defends-russia-investigation-essential-testimony-senate-panel/story?id=73338331\">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election and was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527663050/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired by Trump</a> in 2017. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s own words support the idea that the Trump administration is targeting Comey. <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\">In a social media post</a> on Sept. 20, 2025, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with prosecutions against Comey, Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James: “They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. …JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p>\n\n<p>If the case against Comey is exceedingly weak – and little more than a political prosecution – then, in my view <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kdr4x8oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">as a scholar of the U.S. legal system</a>, it should result in the dismissal of charges by the judge or a not guilty verdict by the jury.</p>\n\n<p>But even when an individual is not convicted, the process of defending against charges can itself <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=oPAWAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">be a form of punishment</a>, as renowned legal scholar <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/malcolm-feeley/#tab_profile\">Malcolm Feeley</a> pointed out almost 50 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how the criminal justice process punishes even innocent people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The criminal justice process</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/steps-federal-criminal-process\">criminal justice process is complex</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indictment\">grand jury returns an indictment</a> at the request of a prosecutor, the accused <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/arraignment\">appears in court for their arraignment</a>. They are informed of the charges against them and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/plea\">typically enter a plea</a>. </p>\n\n<p>During what’s called “<a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/procedure/discovery-in-criminal-cases/\">discovery</a>,” the prosecution and defense investigate the evidence the other side plans to rely on. There are also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pretrial-motions\">pretrial motions</a> in which the parties ask judges to dismiss charges and accept or exclude evidence. </p>\n\n<p>The defense and prosecution may also meet to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/pleabargaining\">discuss a plea bargain</a>, wherein the accused may plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence or reduced charges. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no plea bargain, then the case moves to trial, which is itself a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/trial\">complicated process</a>. If a defendant is found guilty, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/appeal\">they can mount an appeal</a> to higher courts in an attempt to have their conviction overturned.</p>\n\n<p>To help navigate this process, criminal defendants typically hire a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>And good lawyers don’t come cheap.</p>\n\n<h2>Money and time</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indigent\">Indigent defendants</a>, who do not have the financial resources to pay their own legal fees, <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/defender-services\">can rely on public defenders</a> paid for by the government. </p>\n\n<p>But individuals who can afford to pay for their own lawyer face a substantial financial burden for attorney services <a href=\"https://www.criminallegalnews.org/media/publications/brennan_center_for_justice_reentry_report_2010.pdf\">and court fees</a>. An experienced criminal defense lawyer can charge <a href=\"https://ludwiglawfirm.com/understanding-the-real-cost-of-hiring-a-federal-criminal-defense-lawyer\">more than US$1,000</a> <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/big-law-firm-sues-hunter-biden-for-unpaid-legal-bills-tied-to-gun-trial-other-cases/\">per hour</a>, with fees quickly adding up. This means that mounting a legal defense can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, it takes a great deal of time to prepare for a criminal case. While lawyers and their staff do much of the legwork for trial preparation, a client works with their attorneys to help formulate a defense.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, criminal defendants lose one of the most <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethharris/2017/08/30/study-shows-time-is-the-most-valuable-commodity-so-heres-a-smart-way-to-value-time/\">precious commodities in the world</a>: their time.</p>\n\n<p>And this time can come at a tangible cost in the form of lost wages, which harms their day-to-day lives. Put simply, every hour spent preparing for trial is an hour defendants could spend working or enjoying their lives.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three women holding each other as they stand outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695164/original/file-20251008-56-kxe7az.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Patrice Failor, center, wife of former FBI Director James Comey, is embraced by daughters Claire Comey, left, and Maurene Comey at the courthouse in Alexandria, Va., where James Comey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Oct. 8, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/patrice-failor-wife-of-former-fbi-director-james-comey-is-news-photo/2239936179?adppopup=true\">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Stress and embarrassment</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not pleasant being charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p>The criminal process, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344888776_Delivering_Timely_Justice_in_Criminal_Cases_A_National_Picture\">which typically lasts months</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mdlawgroup.ca/articles/how-to-manage-stress-during-a-criminal-trial\">takes a toll</a> on one’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2021.100050\">mental</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13218719.2020.1751327\">health</a>. This is largely driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a criminal trial and the possibility of losing one’s freedom if convicted.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2014.1004035\">social stigma</a> that comes with being accused of a crime. This can result in reputational damage, anxiety and embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration appears to recognize this reality. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-agent-relieved-duty-over-refusing-comey-perp-walk-four-people-familiar-say-2025-10-03/\">Several media</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">outlets</a> have reported that FBI leadership had planned a public <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perp%20walk\">perp walk</a> for Comey. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-arrest-perp-walk-james-comey-suspended-agent-refusing-doj-trump/\">According to a CBS News report</a>, this was to have included “‘large, beefy’ agents … ‘in full kit,’ including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo.” Apparently, the plan was aborted after several FBI supervisors refused to cooperate, viewing it as inappropriate. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/04/politics/fbi-agent-fired-comey\">One agent was disciplined for insubordination</a> after refusing to go along with the plan to embarrass Comey in this way. </p>\n\n<h2>Not all criminal defendants suffer the same</h2>\n\n<p>The extent to which criminal defendants experience the criminal justice process as a form of punishment varies from person to person.</p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.finance-monthly.com/james-comeys-net-worth-in-2025-a-deep-dive-into-the-life-and-career-of-the-former-fbi-director/\">high-status people like Comey</a>, lost wages and attorneys’ and court fees may not be that big of a deal. </p>\n\n<p>But these costs may be incredibly significant for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/list-individuals-including-lisa-cook-targeted-trump-administration/story?id=124968309\">other people</a> who have been, or are likely to be, targeted by the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>The high costs of lawyers’ fees are well known to the president. For instance, his political action committee spent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508\">millions of dollars</a> on attorneys’ fees in an unsuccessful effort to defend Trump from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0\">criminal charges</a> in New York.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, people no doubt experience the psychological stress and stigma of a possible criminal conviction differently. But regardless of one’s wealth, the lost time spent preparing a criminal defense is something that cannot be replaced.</p>\n\n<p>The recognition that the criminal process is itself a form of punishment is one of the reasons that the <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/legal-ethics-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/03/GT-GJLE230038.pdf\">Department of Justice has maintained independence</a> from the president. By <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html\">violating the tradition</a> of staying out of politics, the Justice Department in the Trump administration has opened the door for the president to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies.</p>\n\n<p>The mere act of putting them through the criminal process ensures that they suffer, regardless of their guilt or innocence.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266747/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Paul M.

Scott Applewhite</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury on Sept. 25, 2025 – only the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/james-comey-indicted.html\">second time in history</a> an FBI director has faced criminal charges. </p>\n\n<p>The indictment came just five days after President Donald Trump took to social media to demand that Comey be prosecuted, and three days after Trump installed a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/politics/lindsey-halligan-us-attorney-eastern-virginia-trump-james-comey\">former aide</a> as the prosecutor to bring the case. </p>\n\n<p>Legal experts <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/former-doj-officials-warn-comey-indictment-is-a-democracy-threatening-abuse-of-power/\">across the political spectrum</a> describe this as an unprecedented political prosecution that breaks fundamental democratic norms and mirrors tactics used by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-26/comey-indictment-if-everyone-is-guilty-no-one-is-accountable\">authoritarian leaders</a> worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70rnLI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a professor of law</a>, I think Comey’s indictment is momentous because it tests a principle that has protected American democracy for 50 years: Presidents should not direct prosecutors to charge their political enemies. </p>\n\n<p>When leaders can abuse the justice system to target critics and investigators, the rule of law collapses.</p>\n\n<h2>An unconstitutional indictment</h2>\n\n<p>The evidence of political interference in Comey’s indictment is unusually strong. Trump waged an eight-year vendetta against Comey after the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-defends-russia-investigation-essential-testimony-senate-panel/story?id=73338331\">FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 20, Trump <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgg4vgeedo\">posted on Truth Social</a> demanding prosecution: “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell… We can’t delay any longer… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” </p>\n\n<p>After the indictment, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/justice-america-trump-applauds-indictment-dirty-cop-james/story?id=125958551\">Trump called Comey</a> “one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to.”</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment protects against vindictive and selective prosecution. To prove vindictive prosecution, a defendant must show through objective evidence that the prosecutor acted with “genuine animus” and that the defendant would not have been prosecuted except for that hostility.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Five men in suits and ties sit at a table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695155/original/file-20251008-64-7vdzzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Comey listens to the committee chairman at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 8, 2017, in Washington.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=comey&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Alex Brandon</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit explained in <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-4th-circuit/1040785.html\">United States v. Wilson</a> in 2001, the government cannot prosecute someone to punish them “for doing what the law plainly allows him to do.” When circumstances create a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the burden shifts to the government to justify its conduct.</p>\n\n<p>After Comey’s indictment, <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-charges-fbi-donald-trump-rcna233662\">Jordan Rubin</a>, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.’s office, stated: “If the Trump administration’s prosecution of James Comey isn’t ‘selective’ and ‘vindictive,’ then those words have lost all meaning.”</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://fb1cd5ab-5a51-475c-87d1-10904a61146d.usrfiles.com/ugd/fb1cd5_e6234e4a9b5244e8bd59ab3af293ca51.pdf\">three former White House ethics counsels</a> – Norman Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter – wrote to Congress after Comey’s indictment, saying that in the U.S. “a president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin’s Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here. Until now.” </p>\n\n<p>They concluded: “If the Trump administration can do this, then no American is safe from political prosecution.”</p>\n\n<h2>Broken judicial norms</h2>\n\n<p>For 50 years since the Watergate scandal that exposed President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power, American presidents have followed a core principle: They must not interfere in decisions about who gets investigated or charged, especially not for political reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department’s manual includes the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/\">post-Watergate</a> requirement that legal judgments must be “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-1-8000-congressional-relations\">impartial and insulated from political influence</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/james-comey-indictment-fbi-trump-halligan-rcna233910\">three former ethics counsels emphasized</a> that during their service, they “never once saw” Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton “suggest that the Department of Justice should prosecute a specific person, much less a political adversary.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">Comey was indicted on two counts</a> – one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, both in connection with his testimony before a Senate committee in September 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The allegations against Comey were reviewed multiple times. Special counsel John Durham examined them <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/former-special-counsel-john-durham-122036443.html\">during Trump’s first term</a>. Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., during the Biden administration <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/special-counsel-john-durham-undercut-case-james-comey/story?id=126164120\">called Comey to testify before a grand jury</a> about allegedly using his friend Daniel Richman as a conduit to leak information to the press. And <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutors-memo-new-us-attorney-recommended-plans-charge/story?id=125925246\">career prosecutors in 2025 under former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert</a> also reviewed the allegations. Everyone <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-125933152.html\">declined to charge Comey</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The procedural breakdown reveals how fundamentally this case violates norms. </p>\n\n<p>Career prosecutors wrote <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutors-memo-new-us-attorney-recommended-plans-charge/story?id=125925246\">a memo in September 2025</a> stating they could not establish probable cause to charge Comey. When Siebert refused to proceed, Trump removed him and installed Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/white-house-aide-erik-siebert-office\">former personal defense attorney</a>. She has no prosecutorial experience.</p>\n\n<p>Three days later, Halligan brought the indictment. She signed it alone – no career prosecutors put their names on it, as is usually done. The grand jury rejected one of the three charges prosecutors tried to bring, a rare signal of weak evidence.  </p>\n\n<p>Comey’s son-in-law, Troy A. Edwards Jr., a federal prosecutor in the same office where Halligan now works, resigned immediately, stating he was leaving “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/politics/troy-edwards-jr-resigns-comey-indictment\">to uphold my oath to the Constitution</a>.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/08/comey-arraignment-trump/\">Comey was arraigned on Oct. 8</a> and pleaded not guilty.</p>\n\n<h2>Echoes of authoritarians</h2>\n\n<p>Prosecuting former law enforcement officials who investigated the country’s leader is not typical of democracies. It is a hallmark tactic of authoritarian rulers seeking to consolidate power.</p>\n\n<p>In Turkey, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/middleeast/turkey-istanbul-mayor-arrest.html\">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrested his main political rival</a> in March 2025 on corruption charges that critics call politically motivated. Between 2014 and 2020, Erdogan investigated 160,000 Turks for insulting the president and prosecuted 45,000 of them, including a <a href=\"https://www.turkishminute.com/2023/07/12/14-year-old-get-suspended-sentence-for-insult-president-erdogan-on-whatsapp/\">14-year-old boy</a>. More than <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2025/3/26/turkey\">1,400 people were arrested and detained</a> in nationwide protests.</p>\n\n<p>Russia under Vladimir Putin provides the starkest example.

Maduro inherited a stacked Supreme Court from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, that has systematically <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/31/venezuelas-crumbling-facade-democracy\">nullified opposition legislation</a>. The court has also orchestrated takeovers of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/31/venezuelas-crumbling-facade-democracy\">opposition parties</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuelas-supreme-court-certifies-maduros-claims-won-presidential-ele-rcna168020\">certified Maduro’s fraudulent 2024 election claim</a> despite opposition evidence showing it won by a 2-to-1 margin. </p>\n\n<p>And Hungary’s Viktor Orban created the <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/orbans-sovereignty-protectors-hammer-government-critics/\">Sovereignty Protection Office</a> with powers to investigate any organization or person it suspects of receiving foreign support to influence public life or the democratic process. Orban also installed <a href=\"https://eutoday.net/viktor-orban-turned-hungary-into-a-corruption-state/\">a loyalist chief prosecutor</a> under whose office “numerous high-profile allegations of corruption have been either quietly shelved or investigated perfunctorily before being dropped,” according to EU Today. </p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear: When leaders can use the justice system to protect themselves, whether by prosecuting investigators, refusing to investigate corruption or intimidating the judiciary, democratic institutions erode and the rule of law becomes a tool of political control rather than a constraint on power.</p>\n\n<h2>What this means for America</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/26/james-comey-indictment-flaws-00582920\">Legal experts predict</a> Comey will be acquitted – the evidence is weak and the political interference is blatant. </p>\n\n<p>But as a scholar of legal ethics, I believe the damage is already done. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has shown he can force prosecutors to charge his enemies.

A string of high-profile corporate partnerships reflect how universities are embracing AI technology.</p>\n\n<p>The University of Florida began assembling one of the fastest university supercomputers through a collaboration with Nvidia encompassing <a href=\"https://ai.ufl.edu/research/ai-support/nvidia-partnership/\">AI infrastructure, research support and curriculum development</a>. Princeton launched the New Jersey AI Hub with Microsoft, CoreWeave and the state government, which will house <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/03/princeton-features-research-ai-hub-microsoft-coreweave-techsparks\">AI startups on university-owned land under a Princeton director</a>. Meanwhile, the California State University system partnered with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu to all students and faculty, branding itself as “<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-the-csu-system/\">the first AI-powered university system in the United States</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>As a social scientist who studies educational technology and organizational partnerships, I view these collaborations as part of a decades-long shift toward the “<a href=\"http://www.doi.org/10.25148/CRCP.1.1.6092151\">corporatization” of higher education</a> – where universities have become increasingly market-driven, aligning their priorities, culture and governance structures with industry partners. </p>\n\n<p>I see the rise of generative AI as accelerating this trend, which risks undermining higher education’s autonomy and public service mission. Examining the underlying organizational forces that shape the future of higher education can shed light on how AI challenges universities’ traditional principles – and how they might resist corporate influence.</p>\n\n<h2>The rise of corporate partnerships</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past 50 years, private sector support for university research has <a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/wp-content/uploads/driving-us-competitiveness-through-improved-university-industry-partnerships.pdf\">increased tenfold</a>, outpacing overall growth in higher education research spending. A pivotal shift came in 1980, when universities gained the right to retain intellectual property from federally funded research. This made <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/147/4/76/27224/Universities-The-Fallen-Angels-of-Bayh-Dole\">commercialization of university research far easier</a>. Over time, corporate involvement pushed university research toward commercial needs and increasingly exposed universities to the profit motive.</p>\n\n<p>But partnerships haven’t just brought in money for universities; they’ve reinforced <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/3283/academic-capitalism-and-new-economy?srsltid=AfmBOordEdn9U2nlAlx0H3WCLrb4cXICwUuHfKQW4GstaJSjqkeogDOw\">a shift toward closer alignment with industry</a>. Universities expanded dramatically in the second half of the 20th century to <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/11659/great-mistake?srsltid=AfmBOopx1PZQZz2hhFrFQ_aMdaRFS-y8Nkku1uhl8KbcB-dYroOtPs9C\">meet companies’ demand for skilled labor</a>, further coupling higher education to market incentives. </p>\n\n<p>After decades of growth, however, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5246200/demographic-cliff-fewer-college-students-mean-fewer-graduates\">university enrollment peaked in 2010</a>, partly due to demographics, and <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-enrollment-decline/\">the decline is projected to continue</a>. Meanwhile, competition from training programs offered by tech companies <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/07/12/amazon-spend-700-million-training-mostly-outside-college\">has been growing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/mapping-federal-funding-cuts-to-us-colleges-and-universities/\">federal funding has been slashed under President Donald Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As colleges continue to close at <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/tracking-college-closures/\">record rates</a>, the imperative to attract tuition dollars and research grants <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549264/knowledge-for-sale/\">increasingly dictates institutional priorities</a>. I argue that universities risk sidelining research that serves the public interest by looking toward corporate funding and partnerships to fill the gaps. </p>\n\n<p>In my view, the shift away from public-good scholarship to monetizable content and services shaped by external industry partners jeopardizes the academic freedom and intellectual stewardship that once anchored the mission of higher education. For example, under financial constraints, university administrators may be inclined to overlook glaring value misalignments between their public mission and the commercial objectives of AI firms. </p>\n\n<h2>The forces driving universities’ AI initiatives</h2>\n\n<p>At many universities, AI adoption and the turn toward corporate collaborations are driven by more than economic vulnerabilities. The broad range of partnerships with AI companies across higher education can provide insight into the deeper dynamics at work.</p>\n\n<p>Differences in AI partnerships are <a href=\"https://internet2.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2-CDE24-RESEARCH-REPORT_Internet2_HED_V.pdf\">emerging around long-standing divides between types of institutions</a>. <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/\">Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI</a> can be interpreted as an attempt to steer global discourse on ethical AI while preserving human-led research as a marker of elite prestige. Meanwhile, AI initiatives at institutions with a strong focus on teaching and accessibility, such as <a href=\"https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/CSU-AI-Powered-Initiative.aspx\">California State University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/artificial-intelligence/2024/05/21/unpacking-asus-openai-partnership-and\">Arizona State University</a>, appear to prioritize efficiency in learning outcomes and workforce development.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A student at California State University campus walks past a library.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694405/original/file-20251003-56-d2shrk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The California State University system aims to become the first and largest ‘AI-powered university system,’ motivated in part to prepare students for careers in an AI-driven economy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/university-library-at-california-state-university-news-photo/2230923663\">Myung J. Chun via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This underscores how AI partnerships are not guided by market incentives alone. Before universities <a href=\"https://hep.gse.harvard.edu/9781682538920/lifting-the-veil-on-enrollment-management/\">grew into multibillion-dollar businesses</a>, their decision-making was primarily driven by markers of intellectual prestige, such as scholarly excellence and faculty reputation. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3448276.pdf\">Universities largely held a monopoly over knowledge production</a> and served as the primary gatekeepers of intellectual legitimacy, until the digital revolution dramatically <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/users/887687/articles/1265994-the-crumbling-ivory-tower-how-academia-abandoned-knowledge-for-status\">decentralized access to knowledge and its production</a>. Universities now coexist in – and increasingly compete with – a crowded, complex ecosystem of companies and organizations that produce original research. </p>\n\n<p>Generative AI represents a powerful new mode of knowledge production and synthesis, which further threatens to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/an-academic-publisher-has-struck-an-ai-data-deal-with-microsoft-without-their-authors-knowledge-235203\">upend traditional forms of scholarship</a>. Confronted with challenges to their authority, universities may attempt to preserve their elite intellectual status by rushing into partnerships with AI companies <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-nextgenai/\">eager to capture the higher education market</a>. </p>\n\n<p>My interpretation is that economic pressures and the pursuit of prestige may be converging to reinforce a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016146811311500507?casa_token=kxfAIufL0swAAAAA:cQGwuNpjEcqWQRjT_weYyPPL0VeCB3sttza4D2_Rhs5wh9s5O2tvt93FQNtWp1TNZPYUsdTeNYp0KYs\">technocratic approach to higher education</a>, where university decision-making is primarily guided by performance metrics and corporate-style governance rather than the public interest. </p>\n\n<h2>A purposeful path forward</h2>\n\n<p>The evolution of higher education in response to AI has brought <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-is-driving-down-the-price-of-knowledge-universities-have-to-rethink-what-they-offer-260493\">long-standing debates about the purpose of universities to the forefront of public discourse</a>. Decades of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/59723\">corporatization</a> has helped fuel widespread “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_02082\">mission sprawl</a>” and conflicting institutional goals across higher education. Consistent with <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/business/external-control-organizations\">organizational theory</a>, ambiguity about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html\">universities’ role in society</a> could lead many institutions to become increasingly susceptible to corporate co-optation, political interference and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/2025/04/14/who-will-thrive-who-will-struggle-and-who-will-disappear\">eventual collapse</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Although partnerships between universities and corporations can <a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/wp-content/uploads/driving-us-competitiveness-through-improved-university-industry-partnerships.pdf\">advance research and support students</a>, corporate norms and academic principles <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/documents/embed/link/LF2255DA3DD1C41C0A42D3BEF0989ACAECE3053A6A9B/file/D6C84643C00154ECD928B6B61B491896F6D965314ABA?noSaveAs=1\">are inherently distinct</a>. And at many universities the process through which differences in institutional values are surfaced and reconciled is unclear, especially as <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/07/22/faculty-often-missing-university-decisions-ai\">AI initiatives have often sidestepped democratic faculty governance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The recent surge in AI partnerships puts in plain view the growing dominance of market forces in higher education. As universities continue to adopt AI technologies, the consequences for intellectual freedom, democratic decision-making and commitment to the public good will become an increasingly pressing question.</p>\n\n<p><em>Research support was provided by undergraduate research assistant Mehra Marzbani, whose contributions are gratefully acknowledged.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260902/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Chris Wegemer is affiliated with UCLA. </span></em></p>",

She testified that the 1944 MGM movie “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036378/\">Song of Russia</a>” showed clean, well-dressed, happy peasants, which she said was a sanitized, propagandized version of life in the USSR.</p>\n\n<p>Another movie that came under suspicion was “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The <a href=\"https://aphelis.net/wonderful-life-communist-propaganda-fbi-files/\">FBI complained that the 1946 blockbuster</a>, which starred Jimmy Stewart as a broken man who learns the true value of his life, “deliberately maligned the upper classes” with its negative portrayal of Mr. Potter, the town’s richest man.</p>\n\n<p>The HUAC hearings continued for a decade and divided Hollywood. The committee’s interrogators <a href=\"https://theamericanscholar.org/the-director-who-named-names/\">demanded that people turn on each other</a> and “name names.” Due to these hearings, as well as an anti-communist publication called <a href=\"https://broadcast41.uoregon.edu/articles/red-channels-report-communist-influence-radio-and-television\">Red Channels</a>, hundreds of screenwriters, directors, producers, actors and musicians were <a href=\"https://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/index.php/exhibits/the-hollywood-blacklist-collections/\">fired or blacklisted</a> for having ties to liberal groups.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Ten men in suits stand together in a black-and-white photograph taken in the mid-20th century.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=449&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694927/original/file-20251007-56-smfzkq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=564&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nine of 10 Hollywood writers, directors and producers, indicted by a Washington grand jury on charges of contempt of Congress, surrender in a group at the U.S. Marshals Service office in Los Angeles on Dec. 10, 1947.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/HollywoodRedScare/7c08a3a817f249d1b1566b76d8bc5b39/photo\">AP Photo/Harold Filan</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fighting back</h2>\n\n<p>The HUAC hearings brought Hollywood stars and the flashbulbs of the nation’s press corps to Capitol Hill. Conservative screen idols like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000011/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_Gary%2520Cooper\">Gary Cooper</a> testified that communism wasn’t “on the level.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6442\">Friendly witnesses</a>, like Rand and Cooper, were allowed to read prepared statements and to speak for as long as they liked. Such courtesies were not granted to the 10 “unfriendly” witnesses – the suspected communists who became known as the “<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/hollywood-10-biographies\">Hollywood 10</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493251/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1\">John Howard Lawson</a> was the first of the Hollywood 10 to testify. Lawson, after refusing to answer if he was a communist or not, was shouted down by Rep. <a href=\"https://spartacus-educational.com/USAparnell.htm\">J. Parnell Thomas</a>, a New Jersey Republican who served as HUAC chair. After Lawson was removed from the courtroom, HUAC’s chief investigator, Robert Stripling, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41940180\">read detailed evidence</a> of Lawson’s communist affiliations.</p>\n\n<p>Prominent Hollywood liberals understood that these hearings were an attack on free speech, free assembly and other rights <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\">guaranteed by the First Amendment</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/ira-gershwin/\">Ira Gershwin</a>, the lyricist known for his hit show tunes such as “I Got Rhythm” and “They Can’t Take That Away From Me,” hosted the first gathering of the Committee for the First Amendment at his Beverly Hills mansion. Attendees included Judy Garland, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly. </p>\n\n<p>The committee quickly raised US$13,000 – the equivalent of $188,000 today – and chartered an airplane to Washington. Upon their arrival in the capital, they <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/group-of-hollywood-celebrities-are-shown-here-as-they-news-photo/515241846?adppopup=true\">marched and spoke out</a> in support of the Hollywood 10. Next, they produced a radio broadcast, “<a href=\"https://anotheroldmovieblog.blogspot.com/2017/11/hollywood-fights-back-radio-protest.html\">Hollywood Fights Back</a>,” as a defense of the rights of Americans to write, produce, act in and see whatever movies they pleased.</p>\n\n<p>The committee released an initial statement with <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/docsteach.org/wp-content/uploads/documents/25466014/orig_25466014_27190.jpg?fit=1798%2C2500&amp;ssl=1\">35 signatories</a>. A few months later, it published a pamphlet with more than 300 additional names supporting the effort.</p>\n\n<h2>Purging Hollywood</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve never heard of that committee, or if you only learned about it recently when the new version made headlines, you’re not alone. The group fizzled out almost as quickly as it had mobilized.</p>\n\n<p>Bogart, perhaps its most famous member, soon retracted his support for the Hollywood 10, saying in March 1948 that he regretted his trip to Washington. </p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1948-Humphrey_Bogart_on_Hollywood_Blacklist_editorial#google_vignette\">I’m no Communist</a>,” the “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_in_0_q_humphry%2520bogar\">Casablanca</a>” star declared in a widely circulated statement.</p>\n\n<p>Two crucial developments kneecapped the committee. First, the <a href=\"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/hollywood-10/\">HUAC cited the Hollywood 10 for contempt of Congress</a>. They were later tried in court and convicted of that crime. They eventually served prison time.</p>\n\n<p>Also, studio executives drafted new hiring policies for the movie industry. Later known as the “<a href=\"https://cinemahistoryonline.com/tag/waldorf-declaration/\">Waldorf declaration</a>” because the meeting took place in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, the studio heads announced that the Hollywood 10 would be fired and banned from any studio, and that all the studios would agree to fire and ban any known communists.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next decade, hundreds more stars and other key players in the entertainment industry were <a href=\"https://shepherd.com/best-books/hollywood-blacklist\">fired, purged and blacklisted</a> in what became known as the blacklist era.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/about-us/faculty/bios/kathy-newman.html\">professor of English and film studies</a>, and I’m writing a book about <a href=\"https://guides.library.ucla.edu/filmcensorship/blacklist\">progressive films made during those years</a>. The original committee’s members were mainly leftists and liberals whose careers survived the political pressures to root them out of show business.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee for the First Amendment ultimately failed to protect the Hollywood 10 from professional attacks or incarceration, nor did it prevent hundreds of others from being blacklisted.</p>\n\n<h2>Bad timing</h2>\n\n<p>But I don’t believe that the original Committee for the First Amendment was destined to fail.</p>\n\n<p>The Hollywood 10’s legal strategy, rooted in the First Amendment, reflected the hope that their convictions might be eventually overturned by the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p>Unluckily, however, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/justices/frank-murphy/\">Frank Murphy</a> and <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/justices/wiley-blount-rutledge/\">Wiley Blount Rutledge</a>, two of the court’s most liberal justices, died before the appeal of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/07/22/hollywood-ten-contempt-congress-bannon/\">first two Hollywood 10 convictions</a> could reach them.</p>\n\n<p>After President Harry Truman replaced them, the <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,812216,00.html\">Supreme Court</a> declined to hear the appeals. Most of the Hollywood 10 served prison sentences between 1950 and 1951. </p>\n\n<h2>Why bother?</h2>\n\n<p>Given that the Committee for the First Amendment failed to protect Hollywood from conservative repression in the 1940s and 1950s, why would anyone revive it?</p>\n\n<p>One reason is that there are parallels between the blacklist era and today.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Trump administration is trying to get comedians who poke fun at him kicked off the air, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/01/media/jimmy-kimmel-stephen-colbert\">talk show host Jimmy Kimmel</a> being temporarily pulled off the air.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood has also seen a surge in labor organizing. Many members of the new Committee for the First Amendment were on the front lines of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/with-the-end-of-the-hollywood-writers-and-actors-strikes-the-creator-economy-is-the-next-frontier-for-organized-labor-217657\">screenwriters and actors strikes of 2023</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, this fight is arguably worth waging. Most Americans see the First Amendment as enshrining valuable rights. An October 2025 <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/\">Marist poll found that 4 in 5 Americans</a> think the U.S. is restricting First Amendment freedoms too much. </p>\n\n<p>Americans still debate whether or not it was right to fire and blacklist Hollywood’s suspected communists. While many <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvc6IacExI\">see the HUAC hearings as a travesty</a>, <a href=\"https://newideal.aynrand.org/why-rand-was-right-to-testify-against-hollywood-communism/\">others defend the House committee</a> and the anti-communist fervor that inspired it.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_xSdoWt7v0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">‘The Pajama Game,’ a hit movie made in the 1950s, featured a fight by workers for higher pay.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Resilience and silence</h2>\n\n<p>Many look at the blacklist era as a time of capitulation by progressives in the face of repression. While there’s some validity to these claims, I’ve found that many progressive filmmakers also banded together, using allegory and other creative techniques to make movies with progressive – sometimes radical – messages.</p>\n\n<p>Take “The Pajama Game,” for example. It’s a musical comedy about labor trouble in a pajama factory. While the film is a sexy, frothy romp, on the one hand, the film also casts Doris Day as Babe, a feisty union steward. In “Racing with the Clock,” workers sing about the pressure they feel to speed up the pace of their labor.</p>\n\n<p>Scenes include workers organizing a slowdown, sabotaging machinery and going on strike. The last word spoken in the film is “solidarity.”</p>\n\n<p>To me, the revival of the Committee for the First Amendment draws attention to the dangers implicit in efforts to muzzle writers, artists and filmmakers.</p>\n\n<p>“Silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice the people have,” the actress <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000031/\">Katharine Hepburn</a> said in May 1947 in a speech <a href=\"https://thegreatkh.blogspot.com/2012/06/hepburn-and-anti-huac-brigade.html\">written for her by Dalton Trumbo</a>, one of the Hollywood 10. “Destroy culture and you destroy one of the strongest sources of inspiration from which a people can draw strength to fight for a better life.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266751/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kathy M.

      "content": "<p>In today’s hot housing market, winning a bidding war can feel like a triumph. But my research shows <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5399525\">it often comes with a catch</a>: Homebuyers who win bidding wars tend to experience a “winner’s curse,” systematically overpaying for their new homes.</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.steve-sh-choi.com\">a real estate economist</a>, and my colleagues and I analyzed nearly 14 million home sales in 30 U.S. states over roughly two decades. We found that people who paid more than the asking price for their homes – a reliable sign of a bidding war – were more likely to default on their mortgages and saw significantly weaker returns.</p>\n\n<p>How much weaker? On average, homebuyers who won bidding wars saw annual returns that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than those who didn’t, we found. We specifically looked at “unlevered” returns – basically, the returns you’d get if you bought the home outright with cash, without factoring in a mortgage. </p>\n\n<p>Since the typical homeowner in our sample held a property for 6.3 years before selling it, this translates to about an 8.2% overpayment. Bidding-war winners were also 1.9 percentage points likelier to default.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps that loss would be worth it to someone who absolutely loves the property – but we found that homebuyers who purchase after a bidding war are also faster to resell. This suggests their overpayment is based less on enduring affection and more on bidding-war fever.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that the effects of the winner’s curse – lower home appreciation and higher default rates – are stronger in places where bidding wars are more common. One example is my hometown of Rochester, New York, which has become a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-to-rochester-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-2021-7\">bidding-war hot spot</a> in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Who bears the brunt? Lower-income, Black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to overpay in bidding wars, we found, making them more likely to suffer from the winner’s curse. This suggests that hot housing markets can worsen inequality.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>While housing is the largest single form of wealth Americans own, past research on the winner’s curse mostly dealt with land auctions and company mergers – not the nation’s roughly <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B25032?t=Units+and+Stories+in+Structure\">76 million owner-occupied, single-family homes</a>. Our work is the first to show the direct evidence of the winner’s curse in residential housing markets. </p>\n\n<p>This matters now because the housing market is cooling. Those who bought in the post-pandemic housing market and listed their homes in 2025 are already facing <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/selling-at-a-loss-2025/\">the risk of selling at a loss</a>. Because this risk falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic homebuyers, it could further widen the wealth gap. </p>\n\n<p>By one measure, foreclosures are up <a href=\"https://www.homes.com/news/foreclosure-rates-rise-nationwide/325546485/\">18% year over year</a>. If the brunt of these losses falls on lower-income or otherwise vulnerable homeowners, the result could be an increase in housing insecurity and homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that the winner’s curse may be preventable.

That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/geothermal-investment-soars-85-as-breakthrough-tech-unlocks-500-gw-us-potential/\">US$1.7 billion</a> in public funding – <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/geothermal-investment-soars-85-as-breakthrough-tech-unlocks-500-gw-us-potential/\">compared with $2 billion for all of 2024</a>, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eaaEUuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">exploration geophysicist and energy engineer</a>, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.</p>\n\n<p>A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/enhanced-geothermal-systems-great-basin-could-supply-10-us-electricity\">as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation</a> – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/technology-breakthroughs-are-unlocking-geothermal-energys-vast-potential-in-countries-across-the-globe\">15% of the world’s electricity needs</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two people stand near a large container of shucked corn while steam billows from a pool of water behind them.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=403&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694656/original/file-20251006-56-vw9caa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=506&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">For generations, Maori people in New Zealand, and other people elsewhere around the world, have made use of the Earth’s heat, as in hot springs, where these people are cooking food in the hot water.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/new-zealand-rotorua-whakarewarewa-thermal-area-maori-women-news-photo/454200824\">Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why geothermal energy is unique</h2>\n\n<p>Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, <a href=\"https://geothermal.org/our-impact/blog/public-health-benefits-geothermal\">providing consistent, reliable power</a> with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.</p>\n\n<p>Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/utahs-hottest-new-power-source-is-below-the-ground\">deliver 100 megawatts</a> of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of <a href=\"https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/power-plants-average-capacities/\">power generated by the average coal plant</a> in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.</p>\n\n<p>But the project, <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-breaks-ground-on-the-worlds-largest-next-gen-geothermal-project/\">estimated to cost $1.1 billion</a>, is not complete. When <a href=\"https://energycapitalhtx.com/fervo-cape-station-funding\">complete in 2028</a>, the station is projected to deliver <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/\">500 megawatts of electricity</a>. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to <a href=\"https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/\">various technical improvements</a> since the project broke ground.</p>\n\n<p>And geothermal energy is becoming <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wind-and-solar-energy-are-cheaper-than-electricity-from-fossil-fuel-plants/\">economically competitive</a>. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/fe8d11b6-b1a6-43d9-9351-47d86ed1dfbc/TheFutureofGeothermal.pdf\">as little as $50 per megawatt-hour</a>, a price <a href=\"https://www.pv-tech.org/us-utility-scale-solar-pv-lcoe-tightens-to-us38-78-mwh-in-2025-lazard/\">competitive with other renewable sources</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of geothermal energy</h2>\n\n<p>There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-power-plants.php\">Hydrothermal systems</a></strong> tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/detail/features/2023/full-steam-ahead-unearthing-the-power-of-geothermal\">geologically active areas</a> where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>Some hydrothermal facilities, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-8252(91)90018-B\">Larderello in Italy</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/hydrothermal-resources\">operated for over a century</a>, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in <a href=\"https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2014/Sepulveda.pdf\">New Zealand</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/historical-overview-on-geothermal-at-the-geysers-california/\">U.S.</a> have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large yellow vehicle with a tall tower on it stands in front of a house.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694657/original/file-20251006-56-y7pg6r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A drilling rig sits outside a home in White Plains, N.Y., where a geothermal heat pump is being installed.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateSchoolsHeatPumps/6e19fccaaa2b4b4fabbfe17c313f2332/photo\">AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced geothermal systems</strong> effectively <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/electric-power-and-natural-gas/our-insights/is-geothermal-energy-ready-to-make-its-mark-in-the-us-power-mix\">create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes</a> just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1085112/enhanced-geothermal-systems-renewable-energy-drilling-breakthrough-technologies\">hydraulic fracturing</a> for oil and gas production. </p>\n\n<p>A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems\">dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground source heat pumps</strong> do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just <a href=\"https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-ground-loop-frequently-asked-questions\">6 or</a> <a href=\"https://robonrenovations.blogspot.com/2013/09/how-deep-are-pipes-of-ground-source.html\">8 feet down</a> (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter <a href=\"https://makenergy.com/ground-source-heat-pump-borehole-guide/\">hundreds of feet lower</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/guide_to_geothermal_heat_pumps.pdf\">more efficient than</a> <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/air-source-heat-pumps\">air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits</a>, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even <a href=\"https://igshpa.org/wp-content/uploads/12-Commercial-District-Energy-Systems-Brian-Urlaub.pdf\">neighborhood or business developments</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Direct-use applications</strong> also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. <a href=\"https://www.wbdg.org/resources/geothermal-energy-direct-use\">Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops</a>; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101915\">100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity</a>. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/CEC-500-2020-020.pdf\">lithium concentrations in the groundwater</a> of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially <a href=\"https://transform.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lithium-and-Geothermal-Resources.pdf\">supply battery manufacturers</a>. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as <a href=\"https://calexicochronicle.com/2025/09/16/battle-over-salton-sea-lithium-project-heads-to-appeals-court/\">legal challenges to it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/heated-volcanic-rocks-store-energy\">underground rock formations</a> to <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/storing-energy-underground-reservoir-thermal-energy-storage-shows-promise/\">store energy as heat</a> when consumer demand is low and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2025.115761\">use it to produce electricity</a> when demand rises.</p>\n\n<p>Some geothermal power stations can <a href=\"https://research-hub.nrel.gov/en/publications/techno-economic-viability-of-flexible-dispatch-of-unconventional-?\">adjust their output to meet demand</a>, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. <a href=\"https://jpt.spe.org/the-multiple-facets-and-versatility-of-geothermal-energy\">Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources</a> and battery storage are increasing the <a href=\"https://geothermal.org/our-impact/blog/geothermal-hybrid-renewable-systems\">reliability of above-ground renewable power</a> <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/this-texas-geothermal-startup-is-storing-energy-in-the-ground\">in Texas</a>, among other places.</p>\n\n<p>And geothermal energy can power <a href=\"https://jpt.spe.org/the-multiple-facets-and-versatility-of-geothermal-energy\">clean hydrogen production</a> as well as energy-intensive efforts to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture\">physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a>, as is <a href=\"https://energydigital.com/news/why-iceland-is-the-global-climate-tech-capital\">happening in Iceland</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram shows pipes extending down from the surface of the ground, pushing cold water into hot rocks below, and drawing hot water back up.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=956&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694660/original/file-20251006-56-2xk8x2.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1201&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Enhanced geothermal systems can be built almost anywhere and can take advantage of existing wells to save the time and money of drilling new holes deep into the ground.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/geothermal-schematicpng\">U.S. Geological Survey</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, the U.S. has <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/\">about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity</a>, mostly in the West. That’s <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3\">about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production</a>, but the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/its-a-hot-topic-geothermal-energy-and-how-usgs-science-could-help-harness-it\">amount of available energy is much larger</a>, according to federal and international engineering assessments.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enss.2025.01.004\">converting abandoned oil and gas wells</a> for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread. </p>\n\n<p>One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah.

This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and <a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/10161/32310\">environmental disruption</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/wells-opportunity\">accelerates deployment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are as many as <a href=\"https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/abandoned-oil-gas-wells/\">4 million abandoned oil and gas wells</a> across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2024.100797\">opportunities for clean energy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Challenges and trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p>Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://paceventures.com/articles/geothermal-the-hottest-underground-movement-in-energy\">Drilling is expensive</a>, and conventional systems need <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48090\">specific geological conditions</a>. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, <a href=\"https://energy.sustainability-directory.com/question/what-challenges-does-egs-deployment-present\">risk causing earthquakes</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-energy-and-the-environment.php\">Overall emissions are low</a> from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/hydrogen-sulfide-and-health\">corrosive gas that is toxic to humans</a> and can contribute to <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/resources/environmental-impacts-geothermal-energy\">respiratory irritation</a>. But <a href=\"https://sites.lafayette.edu/egrs352-sp14-geothermal/contexts-and-consequences/environmental-pollutants/\">modern geothermal plants use abatement systems</a> that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>And the systems do use water, though <a href=\"https://bkvenergy.com/learning-center/environmental-impact-of-geothermal-energy/\">closed-loop systems</a> can minimize consumption.</p>\n\n<p>Building geothermal power stations does require <a href=\"https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-energy-raises-capital-to-drive-geothermal-development/\">significant investment</a>, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can <a href=\"https://courses.ems.psu.edu/earth104/node/1303\">offset many of these costs</a>. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/fervo-energy-raises-over-200-million-to-build-u-s-geothermal-energy-project\">government subsidies are no longer necessary</a> for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266555/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Moones Alamooti does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Our findings, published in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2025.103069\">Journal of Health Economics</a>, show that minor physical health conditions like mild seasonal allergies, previously thought not to be an immediate trigger of suicide, are indeed a risk factor. </p>\n\n<p>To evaluate the link between seasonal allergies and suicide, my co-authors and I combined daily pollen measurements with daily suicide counts across 34 U.S. metropolitan areas. </p>\n\n<p>Because both pollen and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00104-3\">suicide are sensitive to weather conditions</a>, we carefully accounted for temperature, rainfall and wind. We also controlled for differences in local climate and plant life, since pollen levels vary by region, and for seasonal averages that might otherwise obscure results. This allowed us to compare suicide counts on days with unexpectedly high pollen to days with little or none in the same county.</p>\n\n<p>The results were striking. Relative to days with no or low levels of pollen, we found that deaths by suicide rose by 5.5% when pollen levels are moderate and 7.4% when levels are high. The increase was even larger among people with a known history of mental health conditions or treatment. We also showed that on high-pollen days, residents of affected areas experience more depressive symptoms and exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis suggests that allergies exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing some people toward crisis. We suspect that sleep disruption is the link between allergies and suicide rates.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db460.htm\">80 million Americans experience seasonal allergies</a> each year. </p>\n\n<p>Symptoms include sneezing, congestion, itchy eyes and scratchy throat. Most people experiencing these symptoms feel sluggish during the day and sleep poorly at night. Allergy sufferers might not realize, however, that these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.01483.x\">symptoms reduce alertness and cognitive functioning</a> – some of the factors that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.033\">can worsen mental health</a> and increase vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>Suicide rates have been growing steadily in the past two decades, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html\">by 37% between 2000 and 2018</a>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm\">49,000 Americans died by suicide in 2022</a>, and over 616,000 visited emergency departments for self-harm injuries. </p>\n\n<p>Although socioeconomic and demographic factors are the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22526\">most important predictors of suicide</a>, much less is known about its short-term triggers. Our study adds to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3386/w30626\">growing evidence that the environment</a> – including something as natural as pollen – can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2221621120\">influence mental health risks</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>This issue is likely to become more urgent as the climate changes. Rising temperatures <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28764-0\">lengthen pollen seasons and increase pollen volume</a>. Over the past two decades, pollen seasons <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/allergy-season-is-getting-more-intense-with-climate-change-were-creating-better-pollen-forecasts-to-help-203881\">have grown in both intensity and duration</a>, and projections suggest they will <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/worsening-allergies-arent-your-imagination-windy-days-create-the-perfect-pollen-storm-2546\">continue to worsen</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That means more people will experience stronger allergy symptoms, with ripple effects not only for physical health but also for sleep, mood and mental well-being.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"3-dimensional illustration of a variety of pollen grain types being transported through the air.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694929/original/file-20251007-56-860thl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Higher temperatures from climate change contribute to more pollen in the air for longer periods of time during pollen seasons.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pollen-grains-which-can-trigger-allergies-are-royalty-free-image/1758572496?phrase=pollen%20grains%20allergy%20season&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Christoph Burgstedt/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What we still don’t know</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the scale of the problem, there are no national systems in the U.S. to consistently measure and communicate pollen levels. Most communities lack reliable forecasts and alert systems that would allow vulnerable people to take precautions. This gap limits both prevention and research.</p>\n\n<p>Our study focused on metropolitan areas where pollen and death counts were available, but we cannot yet generalize to rural areas. That is a concern because rural communities often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00369\">face greater shortages in mental health care</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/haschl/qxae035\">pharmacy access</a> – and have seen <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6618a1.htm\">rising suicide rates over the past decade</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>For people who are already receiving mental health care, recognizing and treating seasonal allergies is a key part of self-care. </p>\n\n<p>Over-the-counter medications can be <a href=\"https://secure.medicalletter.org/TML-article-1725a\">highly effective at reducing symptoms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>More broadly, people should be aware that during peak allergy season, reduced alertness, sleep disruptions and mood fluctuations may place an increased burden on their mental health, in addition to the allergy symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of policy, improving pollen monitoring and public communication could help people anticipate high-risk days. Such infrastructure would also support further research, particularly in rural areas where data is currently lacking. Our next step, supported by the <a href=\"https://supporting.afsp.org/home\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</a>, is to examine the impact of pollen on rural communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266459/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shooshan Danagoulian receives funding from American Foundation of Suicide Prevention.</span></em></p>",

This includes much of the day-to-day work done by federal information technology and cybersecurity employees, including those at the nation’s leading civilian cybersecurity agency, the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>. </p>\n\n<p>CISA is among the entities that will see the deepest staffing reductions during the shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, according to Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/09/most-dhs-employees-will-continue-working-through-shutdown/\">documentation</a>. Only about one-third of its employees remain on the job after federal employees were furloughed. As if cybersecurity wasn’t challenging enough, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-government-shutdown-plan-employees/761365/\">fewer CISA employees</a> are being asked to do more and more work protecting American cyberspace during the shutdown. And they’ll be working with the promise of getting paid for their efforts at some date in the future once the shutdown ends.</p>\n\n<p>The current CISA situation is grim, from my vantage point as a <a href=\"http://www.csee.umbc.edu/%7Erforno/\">cybersecurity researcher</a> and former industry practitioner. The agency was already experiencing <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-departures-trump-workforce-purge/749796/\">deep cuts to its staff</a> and resources before the shutdown. And now, coinciding with the shutdown, a key law that enabled the agency to facilitate information-sharing with the private sector <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">has expired</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, the cyberdefense agency is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/02/cisa-shutdown-cybersecurity/\">being hobbled</a> at a time when the need for its services has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">never been greater</a>, from the ongoing China-led <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-salt-typhoon-a-security-expert-explains-the-chinese-hackers-and-their-attack-on-us-telecommunications-networks-244473\">Salt Typhoon</a> attack on U.S. telecommunications networks to ransomware, data breaches and threats to infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>CISA was created in 2007 within the Department of Homeland Security. As its name implies, the agency is charged with <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/about\">digital security matters</a> across the federal government. The agency also works with the companies that operate and secure the numerous critical infrastructure sectors of the American economy, such as phone networks, the electric grid and energy pipelines. Additionally, it <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/state-local-governments-cisa-changes-2025-kristi-noem/\">helps state and local governments</a> across the country secure their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/local-governments-are-attractive-targets-for-hackers-and-are-ill-prepared-179073\">vulnerable</a> networks and data.</p>\n\n<p>CISA also publishes threat and vulnerability alerts for the government and cybersecurity community and engages with public and private stakeholders on best practices in response to emerging vulnerabilities. Prior to the recent expiration of the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>, the agency also made it easier for organizations to share useful information with the government to help cybersecurity teams better protect their systems.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4Q5hFykarQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Shutdown-mandated furloughs at the nation’s cybersecurity agency present an opportunity for malicious hackers.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political football</h2>\n\n<p>The agency takes a nonpartisan approach to cybersecurity matters. However, some politicians have accused the agency of political bias for its work helping states protect their voting infrastructure from cyberattacks and external influence. Specifically, the agency was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/14/934220380/as-trump-pushes-election-falsehoods-his-cybersecurity-agency-pushes-back\">repeatedly maligned</a> for calling the 2020 election the “most secure” in history. For some in elected office, this work on election security has tarnished CISA’s reputation and perhaps explains recent <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/cisa-congress-budget-workforce-cuts\">budgetary actions</a> taken against the agency.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, nearly 1,000 CISA employees <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/06/03/cisa-staff-layoffs-resignations-trump-cuts\">have departed</a> the agency through voluntary buyouts or deferred resignations. By the end of May 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-senior-official-departures/748992/\">nearly all of CISA’s senior leadership</a> had resigned or had announced plans to do so.</p>\n\n<p>For 2026, the president’s draft budget proposes to reduce CISA’s head count by nearly one-third, <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2025/05/dhs-budget-request-would-cut-cisa-staff-by-1000-positions/\">dramatically cutting</a> staff from its risk management and stakeholder engagement divisions. Other cuts will significantly reduce the agency’s collaboration activities and funding for CISA’s various cybersecurity education and training programs.</p>\n\n<p>Making the problem worse, the government shutdown began at the same time that Congress failed to renew the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>. This law provided a <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-case-for-reauthorizing-cisa-2015\">legal shield</a> that allowed companies and infrastructure operators to share timely and often sensitive information with CISA about the cyberattacks, vulnerabilities and incidents that they were encountering. </p>\n\n<p>In the wake of the law’s expiration, prudent companies may consider restricting what information they share with the government. Without the indemnification provided by CISA, many companies will likely have their legal teams review any information to be shared with the government. And that takes time. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adversaries do not reduce their <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/10/cyber-threats-abound-as-trump-guts-cyber-agencies-00284735\">attacks against the U.S.</a> based on available federal cyber defense funding or the status of cybersecurity laws. In fact, malicious hackers often strike when their target’s guard is down.</p>\n\n<h2>Charting a better course</h2>\n\n<p>Early in my career I had to work through a prolonged government shutdown. I’ve also participated in and developed assorted public-private information-sharing environments to exchange intelligence and analysis on cyber- and national security matters. And having been in the D.C. area for over 30 years, I’ve seen how government works. So I have a good idea of what’s needed to improve American cybersecurity. The following suggestions are a starting point.</p>\n\n<p>First, Congress could ensure that critical security agencies such as CISA are <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/03/congress-needs-to-shutdown-proof-cisa/\">immune from the threat</a> of recurring federal government shutdowns. If it desired, Congress could set budgets for America’s security agencies on a <a href=\"https://www.cagw.org/federal-budget-in-dire-need-of-reform/\">biennial basis</a> – as 16 states <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/fiscal/fy-2025-state-budget-status\">already do</a> for their entire budgets.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of cybersecurity funding, the White House’s proposed 2026 budget reduces research and education on cybersecurity. For example, the nation’s premiere federal cybersecurity <a href=\"https://sfs.opm.gov/\">scholarship program</a> to recruit, educate and place future federal cybersecurity workers <a href=\"https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\">would be reduced by over 60%</a>. Protecting this funding would allow CISA and the federal government to maintain the pipeline for a robust and capable cybersecurity workforce both today and into the future.</p>\n\n<p>Companies could develop new or expand existing nongovernmental information-sharing networks that are not completely dependent on the government to facilitate or fund, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/\">Cyber Threat Alliance</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/\">Center for Internet Security</a>. Cybersecurity relies on trust. But right now, the instability of the federal government makes it difficult to rely on any entity under its policy or funding influence, no matter how well <a href=\"https://sei.cmu.edu/divisions/cert/\">time-tested and trusted</a>.

When doctors use genetics, it’s usually to try to identify a disease-causing gene to help guide diagnosis and treatment. But for most health conditions, the genetics is far more complicated than how clinicians are currently looking at it in diagnosis, counseling and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Your DNA carries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15393\">millions of genetic variants</a> you inherit from your parents or develop by chance. Some are common variants, shared by many people. Others are rare variants, found in very few people or even unique to a family. Together, these variants shape who you are – from visible traits such as height or eye color to health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.</p>\n\n<p>In our newly published research in the journal Cell, my team and I found that a genetic mutation involved in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">affected by multiple other genetic variants</a>, changing how these conditions develop. Our findings support the idea that, rather than focusing on single genes, taking the whole genome into account would provide insight into how researchers understand what makes someone genetically predisposed to certain diseases and how those diseases develop.</p>\n\n<h2>Primary and secondary variants</h2>\n\n<p>Certain rare variants can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK132154/\">cause problems on their own</a>, such as the genetic mutations that cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. But in many cases, whether someone actually develops symptoms of disease depends on what else is happening across the genome. </p>\n\n<p>While a primary variant might trigger a disease, secondary variants can alter how that disease develops and progresses. Think of it like a song: The melody (primary variant) is the main part of the song, but the bassist and drummer (secondary variants) can change its groove and rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why two people with the same genetic mutation can seem so different. One person might have severe symptoms, another person mild symptoms, and another none at all. These variations can even occur within the same family. This phenomenon, called <a href=\"https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Biology_for_Majors_I_(Lumen)/14%3A_Module_12-_Trait_Inheritance/14.12%3A_Penetrance_and_Expressivity\">variable expressivity</a>, arises from differences in the secondary variants a person has. In most cases, these variants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-018-0266-3\">amplify the effects</a> of the primary mutation. A higher number of secondary variants on top of a primary variant generally leads to more severe disease.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0XYWKm_LoM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Mutations are a source of genetic variation.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a primary variant and a secondary variant together can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1516767\">cause two different disorders</a> in the same person, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.38315\">Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome</a>. Other times, secondary variants have no obvious effect on their own but together can tip the balance of whether and how a disease will appear, even in the absence of a primary variant. This can be seen in the development of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.10.013\">heart disease in children</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Insights from a missing piece of a chromosome</h2>\n\n<p>My team and I studied a genetic change known as a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274565/\">16p12.1 deletion</a>, where a small piece of chromosome 16 is missing. Researchers have linked this mutation to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.534\">developmental delay, intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions</a> such as schizophrenia. Yet most children inherit this genetic variant from a parent who has milder symptoms, different symptoms or sometimes no symptoms at all.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why this happens, we analyzed 442 individuals from 124 families carrying this genetic mutation. We found that children lacking this piece of chromosome 16 had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more secondary variants</a> elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents. These secondary variants took many forms, including both small changes and large deletions, duplications and expansions of their DNA.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two types of chromosomal mutations include deletion and duplication.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.611379\">Gandawijaya et al./Biorender via Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Each type of secondary variant was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">associated with different health outcomes</a>. Some were linked to smaller head size and reduced cognitive function, while others contributed to higher rates of psychiatric or developmental symptoms. This suggests that while a 16p12.1 deletion makes the genome more sensitive to neurodevelopmental disorders, which symptoms manifest depends on which other variants are present.</p>\n\n<p>The story gets even more complex when considering the fact that children not only inherit a 16p12.1 deletion from one parent but also inherit secondary variants from both parents.</p>\n\n<p>My team and I found that the symptoms of the parent with this genetic mutation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">often match those of their spouse</a>. For example, a parent with a 16p12.1 deletion who shows signs of anxiety or depression is more likely to have a partner who also has these symptoms. This pattern, called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-dont-mate-randomly-but-the-flawed-assumption-that-they-do-is-an-essential-part-of-many-studies-linking-genes-to-diseases-and-traits-194793\">assortative mating</a>, means that when parents with overlapping genetic risks have children, those risks can combine and accumulate. </p>\n\n<p>Over generations, this stacking of secondary variants can lead to children who have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">more severe symptoms</a> than their parents. </p>\n\n<h2>Biases in genetics research</h2>\n\n<p>One reason why scientific understanding of secondary variants has lagged is that genetic research often depends on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0467-5\">who is recruited to participate</a> in these studies and how researchers recruit them.</p>\n\n<p>Most studies recruit patients affected with a particular disease. Families recruited from genetic clinics typically have children with severe versions of the disease. But if studies focus only on patients with the most acute symptoms, researchers may overestimate the effects of primary variants and miss the subtler role that secondary variants may play in how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>But if researchers were to study people drawn from the general population – say, by recruiting people from a large shopping mall – some might carry the same primary variant but have far milder symptoms or none at all. This variability allows researchers to better dissect how different parts of the genome interact with each other and affect how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>In our study, for example, we found that people with a 16p12.1 deletion who were recruited from the general population often had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">milder symptoms and different patterns</a> of secondary variants compared to those who were recruited in a clinic.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person in white coat pipetting a sample into a vial, a DNA readout on a screen in the backdrop\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Who’s included in genetics research influences how scientists understand disease.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/scientist-pipetting-sample-into-a-vial-for-dna-royalty-free-image/1334095553\">Cavan Images/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Embracing complexity in genetics</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of a deterministic view where one mutation equals one outcome, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more complex model</a> accounts for the fact that whether and how a disease develops depends on the interplay between different genetic variants and environment. This has implications for how genetics is used in the clinic.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, a child who tests positive for a genetic variant might be diagnosed with a disease tied to that mutation. In the future, doctors might also examine the child’s broader genetic profile to better predict their developmental trajectory, psychiatric risk or response to therapies. Families could be counseled with a more realistic picture of their child’s probability of developing a disease, rather than assuming every person with the same genetic variant will share the same outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The science is still emerging. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncovering-the-genetic-basis-of-mental-illness-requires-data-and-tools-that-arent-just-based-on-white-people-this-international-team-is-collecting-dna-samples-around-the-globe-185997\">Larger and more diverse datasets</a> and models that can better capture the subtle effects of genetic variants and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-your-genes-interact-with-your-environment-changes-your-disease-risk-new-research-counts-the-ways-252139\">environmental factors</a> are still needed.

Lewis</a>, whom many consider one of the most important labor leaders of the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p>Roberts has seen the union through an especially difficult period for the coal industry and grew up immersed in it. He was <a href=\"https://umwa.org/about/leadership/cecil-e-roberts/\">raised in Cabin Creek</a>, West Virginia, where <a href=\"https://wvpublic.org/story/radio/sept-28-1955-labor-activist-mother-blizzard-dies/\">his great-grandmother</a> – an activist in her own right – let miners camp on her property during a legendary strike in 1912.

Let me hear you say, ‘Fired up!’”</p>\n\n<p>Capping off the rousing call-and-response, he shouted, “God bless all of you, you’re the salt of the earth!”</p>\n\n<p>Roberts’ style is a glimpse into a bigger story. For over a century, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2021.100990\">coal has transformed central Appalachia</a>: from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-violent-remaking-of-appalachia/474603/\">the shape of the landscape</a> to <a href=\"https://npshistory.com/publications/nha/national-coal/survey.pdf\">place names</a>, and from <a href=\"https://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu/content/music-and-coal-activism-perspectives-field\">folk music</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWlmSGIFlP8\">crafts</a> to economic conditions.</p>\n\n<p>All the while, religion has been transforming in the mountains, too. Labor and religion are deeply entangled here – a subject <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/faculty-listing/detail/callahan\">I explored</a> in my book “<a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">Work and Faith in the Kentucky Coal Fields: Subject to Dust</a>.” </p>\n\n<h2>‘Railroad religion’</h2>\n\n<p>In the 1880s, two groups rushed into the central Appalachian Mountains: industrialists <a href=\"https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/entries/1301\">seeking coal</a>, and missionaries <a href=\"https://collections.library.appstate.edu/research-aids/home-missions-movement-appalachia\">seeking moral reform</a>. Both changed the region forever, and their stories were intertwined. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, central Appalachia was widely depicted in the popular press as a backward, ignorant region whose mountainous terrain kept its people isolated, outside the flow of progress – <a href=\"https://eberly.wvu.edu/news-events/eberly-news/2017/06/12/the-h-word-fighting-negative-language-stereotypes-in-appalachia\">a stereotype still common today</a>. Equating economic progress with moral progress, many Americans assumed that developing industry would lift people out of what they perceived as fatalism and superstition. </p>\n\n<p>The coal industry used this idea to promote its rapid exploitation of mountain resources. Companies built railroads to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57780-3_1\">connect the region to the national market</a>, developed industrial coal mines and reshaped the central Appalachian economy. <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&amp;context=wlufac\">Missionaries opened churches</a>, schools and camps.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo of a settlement on a small hill along a river.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694180/original/file-20251002-56-noscky.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Henry Ford founded Twin Branch, W.Va. – shown here in the 1920s – as a town for coal miners.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/henry-ford-a-coal-mine-owner-and-operator-here-is-a-news-photo/515208302?adppopup=true\">Bettmann via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Company-owned <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/minewars-coalcamps/\">coal towns</a> encompassed miners’ lives. People who had long farmed for themselves and lived, as the Bible told them to, “<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&amp;version=KJV\">by the sweat of their brow</a>,” became dependent upon coal companies as mine development shrank the size of family farms. Not only did employers own the miners’ houses, but they also <a href=\"https://www.appalachianhistory.net/2018/09/company-store-scrip.html\">paid workers in “scrip</a>,” which was redeemable only at the company store. </p>\n\n<p>Many company towns included theaters, offered films and music, and even built churches and paid pastors’ salaries. These were typically mainline Protestant churches, such as Methodist or Presbyterian.</p>\n\n<p>To some Appalachian natives, these denominations <a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">were known as “railroad religion</a>” because of the way they entered the mountains. And, for many miners, these were the churches of management. When there was labor unrest, the coal town churches tended to side with the companies, advising miners against strikes or agitation. </p>\n\n<h2>Faith and action</h2>\n\n<p>The churches of most miners born in central Appalachia, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p064142\">were in the mountain communities</a> – independent Baptist or <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Holiness-movement\">Holiness congregations</a> whose pastors were usually miners themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Pastors preached about the dangers and sacrifices miners faced deep underground, in an age of few regulations. God was <a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253352378/work-and-faith-in-the-kentucky-coal-fields/\">on the side of the oppressed and downtrodden</a>, they stressed – and those who gained at others’ expense would ultimately face divine judgment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their passionate preaching was meant to inspire action, whether it was committing one’s life to Jesus or to the union. Labor rights were deeply understood as religious issues, rooted in Christian concerns for justice and care.</p>\n\n<p>John Sayles’ <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093509/\">1987 film “Matewan</a>” powerfully depicted the divided role that religion played in West Virginia’s coalfields. One preacher, played by Sayles, equates the union with “the Prince of Darkness.” Another, a young miner, advocates in biblical terms for the union’s righteousness and helps to lead a strike. The result was the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/matewan-massacre.htm\">Matewan Massacre</a> of 1920: a bloody battle between miners and armed guards hired by the mine owners.</p>\n\n<p>Miner preachers and independent churches were central to the organization of miners in eastern Kentucky in the 1930s, too, during <a href=\"https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeMoments/moments14RS/web/legislative%20moment%2046.pdf\">another period of violence</a> between mine operators and miners over conditions, wages and unionization. It was during this time that miner’s wife and singer Sarah Ogan Gunning penned “<a href=\"https://www.folkstreams.net/films/dreadful-memories\">Dreadful Memories</a>,” turning the traditional hymn “Precious Memories” into a visceral depiction of miners’ struggle and a call for unionization:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“Dreadful memories, how they linger,<br>\nHow they ever flood my soul.<br>\nHow the workers and their children<br>\nDied from hunger and from cold.”</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A black and white photo of several men in slacks and shirts standing outside a small white building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C90%2C742%2C417&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694318/original/file-20251003-56-s5facx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=609&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Miners in Harlan County, Ky., arrive at the Pentecostal Church of God building for a union meeting in 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lejunior,_Harlan_County,_Kentucky._Miners_arrive_at_the_Pentecostal_Church_of_God_building_for_a_union_meeting_of_P_V_%26_K_Company,_local_UMWA_-_DPLA_-_f8624020281c28df8f910c5d05f81775.tiff\">Department of the Interior/National Archives at College Park via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Looking to the future</h2>\n\n<p>Today, it is still not surprising to find religious – particularly Christian – rhetoric in labor organizing. United Auto Workers President <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/09/uaw-shawn-fain-christian-radicalism-socialism\">Shawn Fain</a> is another example of a union leader whose speeches draw from the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>But the dynamics of religion and class forged by industrial mining have shaped central Appalachia’s culture in lasting ways particular to the coalfields. The history of labor struggle, infused with religious idioms, is a source of identity and values evident in everything from union meetings in churches to prayers on picket lines.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the United Mine Workers of America is focused less on coal itself, which miners know cannot last forever. The union <a href=\"https://umwa.org/about/who-we-represent/\">represents members in other sectors</a>, too, including public employees, manufacturing, health care and employees of the Navajo Nation. It has also focused its work on <a href=\"https://umwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UMWA-Preserving-Coal-Country-2021.pdf\">an equitable transition to renewable energy</a>: one that accounts for the economic, cultural and environmental destruction that a single-industry economy has wreaked on central Appalachia.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black wall with paler silhouettes of men standing along it, positioned above a low stone wall next to the road.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694315/original/file-20251003-56-myl1jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A memorial in Whitesville, W.Va., honors the 29 miners killed in a 2010 explosion in Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch coal mine in nearby Montcoal.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/whitesville-wv-a-wall-of-marble-silhouettes-at-the-upper-news-photo/2169927662?adppopup=true\">Kristian Thacker for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Likewise, the United Mine Workers of America has fought to hold coal companies to their <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/about/leadership/statements/keeping-americas-promise-retired-coal-miners-and-their-families\">pension and health care obligations</a> toward retired and sick miners whose work fueled the country and made companies rich. </p>\n\n<p>And that struggle, Roberts would say, is a religious one as well.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262472/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richard J.

Most states require kindergartners get <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/whoopingcough.html#:%7E\">vaccines for pertussis</a> – that’s whooping cough – and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625#:%7E\">tetanus</a>, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles\">measles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/index.html#:%7E\">mumps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rubella/symptoms-causes/syc-20377310\">rubella</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/index.html\">chickenpox</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For older kids, a booster of the tetanus and pertussis vaccine is typically required, as well as a <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22442-meningococcal-disease\">vaccine for meningococcal</a> disease. </p>\n\n<p>Vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm\">reduce the risk of outbreaks</a> in places where transmission of these diseases is easy. Not only do vaccinations help keep both students and teachers safe, it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.11.003\">encourages overall higher community coverage</a> for these vaccines. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do scientists track the safety of vaccines over time?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> Before vaccines are approved, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/how-developed-approved.html#:%7E\">they undergo rigorous trials</a>. During this process, scientists look at the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, testing it first in small groups to assess safety, then in larger groups to confirm protection and detect uncommon side effects. That process continues <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/about/monitoring.html\">after the vaccine is approved</a>. Those systems continually monitor the safety of vaccines, both here in the U.S. as well as around the world. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the vaccination coverage trends for kindergartners?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> What we have seen is a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html#:%7E\">small downward trend since 2019</a>, the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It slipped from 95% of new kindergartners being up to date on many of their routine vaccines to about 92%. </p>\n\n<p>That’s a small percentage decrease, so a great majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids. But at the same time, anything below our target of 95% for diseases like measles becomes a problem, because that’s below the level that’s needed for what we call <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/herd-immunity.html\">herd immunity</a>, or community immunity. When that happens, it’s not a matter of if, but when, we see an outbreak of these infectious diseases.</p>\n\n<p>And while nationwide rates are important to look at, outbreaks happen <a href=\"https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-05-07/health-officials-high-alert-measles-st-louis-missouri\">at local community levels</a>. For example, earlier this year, an outbreak of measles in West Texas spread rapidly through communities where vaccination rates had slipped <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread\">well below the state average</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>So, the vaccination rate at your own school or community is much more meaningful than what the national vaccination rate is. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do non-medical vaccine exemptions work?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> First, actual medical exemptions are rare, and these occur when the vaccine is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html\">unsafe for the child to receive</a>, like when he or she has a known severe allergic reaction to vaccine ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Non-medical exemptions for vaccines are often for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5863/1551-6776-21.2.104\">religious, personal or philosophical reasons</a>. They have been increasing for the past several years, rising from the range of 1 to 2% <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html\">up to 3.6% in the 2024–25 school year</a>. That’s a small increase, but again, it’s still concerning. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are some parents vaccine hesitant?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> There are multiple reasons. These include misinformation which algorithm-driven echo chambers on social media can <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/vaccine-misinformation-outpaces-efforts-counter-it\">spread at an alarming rate right now</a>. Also, Americans report <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/\">less trust in institutions and experts</a>, and studies have found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2025.1608162\">growing partisanship around vaccines</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, vaccines are <a href=\"https://ysph.yale.edu/research/information-sheets/childhood-vaccinations/\">victims of their own success</a>. They have worked so well that many diseases like polio <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio\">aren’t routinely seen anymore</a>. That might lead a parent to think the risk for their child is so low that the vaccine is not necessary. But the fact is, vaccines are simply holding these diseases at bay. And as vaccination rates drop, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/vaccine-measles-pertussis-health-wellness#:%7E\">these diseases will come back</a> and more kids will be at risk. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for parents?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Higgins:</strong> The most important thing you can do as a parent is to keep your kids up to date on required vaccines. That includes the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm#:%7E\">annual flu shot</a>. Follow your state’s requirements and current recommendations from trusted sources like the <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and your own personal pediatrician to know which vaccines your child should have.</p>\n\n<p>You also want to reinforce other common sense approaches to keeping your children healthy. Make sure they know <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/most-people-dont-wash-their-hands-properly-heres-how-it-should-be-done-125330\">how to wash their hands properly</a> and that they stay home when they’re sick. Teach them to sneeze and cough into their elbow instead of into their hands – even though doing so <a href=\"https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/health-myth-coughing-into-your-elbow/\">isn’t a perfect solution</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a pediatrician, I love when my families come and talk to me about their concerns. I help them walk through their worries so they can feel more confident that they’re making a truly informed decision that’s in the best interest of their child’s health. </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sciline.org/\">SciLine</a> is a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit that helps journalists include scientific evidence and experts in their news stories.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265555/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Higgins is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

colleges</h2>\n\n<p>TCUs enroll <a href=\"https://educationusa.state.gov/sites/default/files/field_resource_file/tribal_colleges_and_university_information_sheet_final_1_0.pdf\">approximately 30,000 students</a> each year, including some non-Native students. The median annual tuition at <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/university/tribal-colleges\">TCUs is US$3,572</a>, making them more affordable than <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-state\">most other public universities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://pnpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TCU_FactSheet_Feb25.pdf\">35 accredited TCUs</a> across 13 states, including Montana, Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota. All of these schools are nonprofits. </p>\n\n<p>While a single Native tribe sometimes sets up a tribal college, in other cases a consortium of tribes or the federal government helps establish a school. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their differences, tribal colleges and universities all have the same mission of teaching Indigenous history, culture and languages. </p>\n\n<p>All the tribal colleges also offer associate degrees and certifications. Twenty-two of them have only baccalaureate programs, and nine have master’s programs. <a href=\"https://www.navajotech.edu\">Navajo Technical University</a>, a tribal college in Crownpoint, New Mexico, which has the <a href=\"https://www.navajotech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Navajo-Technical-University-Fall-2019-Enrollment-Highlights-Report.pdf\">largest enrollment size</a> of all the TCUs, began offering a first of its kind doctorate program in Diné Studies in 2024. This program focuses on the language, culture and history of the Diné people, also known as Navajo people.</p>\n\n<p>Affordability has always been a consideration when TCUs set tuition and fees, since most are located on rural <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/native-american-reservations-by-state\">American Indian reservations</a> with <a href=\"https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=ballardbrief\">high unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://ncrc.org/racial-wealth-snapshot-native-americans/\">poverty rates</a>, as well as few available jobs. </p>\n\n<p>TCUs keep their tuition relatively low in part because a majority of their <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-federal-funding?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">funding comes from the federal government</a>. They also receive funding from philanthropic organizations.</p>\n\n<p>TCUs also generally have minimal overhead costs, since most students live off-campus and only a handful of these colleges and universities offer on-campus housing. Most TCUs have both in-person and online courses.</p>\n\n<p>While there is no single profile of a TCU student, I found that it is common to encounter a 30-year-old, single mother who works full time while trying to earn a college degree. </p>\n\n<h2>A growth in college enrollment</h2>\n\n<p>In 1968, just <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED281693.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">181 Native Americans</a> graduated from a four-year college. </p>\n\n<p>That same year, the Navajo Nation <a href=\"https://ehillerman.unm.edu/1687#sthash.DW5z2AMG.dpbs\">established the first tribal college</a>, then called the Navajo Community College, in Tsaile, Arizona. This school is now <a href=\"http://www.aihec.org/\">called Diné College</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Several factors prevented most Native American students from attending a college or university. </p>\n\n<p>The cost of college was prohibitive, and many Native American students were also not adequately prepared for college in high school. These students and their families also feared that higher education could force them to assimilate into Western and white culture, and erase their own Native traditions and languages. </p>\n\n<h2>A long political relationship</h2>\n\n<p>When considering this historical context, it is important to understand that Native Americans have a unique relationship with the federal government. </p>\n\n<p>Native Americans largely consider this relationship a political one, bound by the various legal precedents, federal policies and executive orders from the 1800s and onward. <a href=\"https://www.bia.gov/bia/history/IndianLawPolicy\">These orders and policies from the past several hundred years</a> vary, but they often focus on questions of land, assimilation and the political independence of Native tribes. </p>\n\n<p>There are also <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-22588/white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for\">treaties and orders</a> that focus on education and spell out the <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/Policy-Advocacy/CurrentLegDocs/TriballyControlledCollegesAndUniversitiesAssistanceActOf1978.pdf\">federal government’s responsibility</a> to help coordinate and <a href=\"https://www.aihec.org/policy-and-advocacy/executive-branch/\">give money to support tribal education</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 1978, Congress <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/senate-bill/1215\">approved the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act</a>, which recognized tribal colleges as higher education institutions and established that the federal government would regularly help fund these schools. </p>\n\n<p>Alongside the creation of new tribal colleges and universities over the past several decades, more and more Native people living on reservations have graduated from high school and received higher education degrees. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Databook-Third-Edition-2025-09-07-1.pdf\">percentage of Native college graduates</a> rose 125% from 1990 to 2020. While 4.5% of Native students living on reservations received a college degree in 1990, that percentage rose to 10.3% with at least a college degree in 2020, according to findings by Harvard Kennedy School in September 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, unlike the high school trends, Native people still graduate college at a much lower rate than the general American population. </p>\n\n<p>In 1990, 20.3% of all Americans had at least a college degree. In 2020, 34.3% of Americans had <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Databook-Third-Edition-2025-09-07-1.pdf\">a college degree at a minimum</a>, according to the Harvard Kennedy School findings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman smiles at a cat that is resting on a cat bed, in a classroom with people seated nearby.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694669/original/file-20251006-56-d1hdsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A professor at Navajo Technical University participates in a veterinary technology program conducted with the Department of Agriculture in 2019 in Crownpoint, N.M.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usdagov/49216628852\">Flickr/U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A lasting impact</h2>\n\n<p>While tribal colleges and universities receive state and federal funding, they are chronically underfunded and often operate in survival mode. In some cases, they lack money to <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/tribal-college-campuses-are-falling-apart-the-u-s-hasnt-fulfilled-its-promise-to-fund-the-schools/\">make needed repairs on campus buildings</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One major reason for this shortfall: While Congress agreed in the late 1970s <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-25/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-41/subpart-B/section-41.29\">to annually give tribal colleges $8,000</a> for each Native student they enroll, it has not met this financial and political commitment. </p>\n\n<p>Tribal colleges annually receive <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-federal-funding#:%7E:text=Congress%20Is%20Underfunding%20Tribal%20Colleges%20by%20$250%20Million%20Per%20Year%20%E2%80%94%20ProPublica\">$250 million less</a> than what the federal government promised them, a 2024 ProPublica investigation found.</p>\n\n<p>Tribal college and universities’ futures were cast in doubt in the spring of 2025, when the Trump administration announced a proposal to cut the <a href=\"https://www.bie.edu\">Bureau of Indian Education’s</a> annual budget from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/us/tribal-colleges-federal-funding-trump.html\">$183 million to $22 million</a>. The Bureau of Indian Education is part of the Department of the Interior and oversees education for Native students.</p>\n\n<p>But the Department of Education went on to announce in September that it would make a one-time, <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/minority-serving-institutions/2025/09/15/ed-reallocates-msi-funding-hbcus-tribal\">$495 million investment</a> in historically Black colleges and universities and TCUs. </p>\n\n<p>TCU leaders say they are still trying to understand the <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2025/09/16/trump-admin-doubles-funding-tribal-colleges-arizona/\">significance of this funding announcement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/how-tribal-educators-are-navigating-budget-challenges/\">what it will result in</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I think it is important to recognize that TCUs make broad contributions to society, well beyond the impact they have on individual students. </p>\n\n<p>TCUs teach entrepreneurship and business development and serve as pilot sites in launching businesses, for example. </p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/FrontPageDocs/National%20Study%20Executive%20Summary_AIHEC%20TCU%20Economic%20Impact%20Study%2009082025.pdf\">every federal dollar invested</a> in tribal colleges, the schools return $1.60 in tax revenue through the increased tax payments of their alumni and their alumni’s employers, according to a September 2025 report by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a national organization that represents TCUs. </p>\n\n<p>TCU <a href=\"https://webassets.aihec.org/FrontPageDocs/National%20Study%20Executive%20Summary_AIHEC%20TCU%20Economic%20Impact%20Study%2009082025.pdf\">alumni also generated</a> $3.8 billion in added income, or gross domestic product, to the national economy from October 2022 through September 2023.</p>\n\n<p>These schools offer a unique pathway for Native students to attend a higher education institution, while teaching them the skills they need to build a stable career.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261222/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I served as President of Cankdeska Cikana Community College (CCCC) one of the 34 tribal colleges located in North Dakota and that is affiliated with AIHEC.

The barrage of unilateral presidential actions has not yet let up. </p>\n\n<p>These have included Trump’s efforts to remove <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/08/least-148000-federal-employees-have-left-government-under-trump-good-government-group-reports/407171/\">thousands of government workers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/tracking-trumps-unprecedented-often-illegal-firings-of-political-appointees-and-watchdogs/\">fire several prominent officials</a>, such as members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the chair of the Commission on Civil Rights. He has also attempted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-order-voice-of-america.html\">shut down entire agencies</a>, such as the Department of Education and the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>\n\n<p>For some scholars, these actions appear rooted in the psychology of an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ego-hubris-and-narcissism-where-donald-trump-ranks-among-the-other-45-american-presidents-241879\">unrestrained politician with an overdeveloped ego</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s more than that.  </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/graham-dodds.html\">a political science scholar</a> who studies presidential power, I believe Trump’s recent actions mark the culmination of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unitary_executive_theory_%28uet%29\">unitary executive theory</a>, which is perhaps the most contentious and consequential constitutional theory of the past several decades.</p>\n\n<h2>A prescription for a potent presidency</h2>\n\n<p>In 2017, Trump complained that <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/11/06/trump-continues-to-degrade-the-presidency-and-theres-no-quick-fix-coming/\">the scope of his power as president</a> was limited: “You know, the saddest thing is that because I’m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I am not supposed to be involved with the FBI, I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.”</p>\n\n<p>The unitary executive theory suggests that such limits wrongly curtail the powers of the chief executive.  </p>\n\n<p>Formed by conservative legal theorists in the 1980s to <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=jcl\">help President Ronald Reagan roll back</a> liberal policies, the unitary executive theory promises to radically expand presidential power. </p>\n\n<p>There is no widely agreed upon definition of the theory. And even its <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/714860\">proponents disagree</a> about what it says and what it might justify. But in its most basic version, the unitary executive theory claims that whatever the federal government does that is executive in nature – from implementing and enforcing laws to managing most of what the federal government does – the president alone should personally control it.</p>\n\n<p>This means the president should have <a href=\"https://shfg.wildapricot.org/executive-branch\">total control over the entire executive branch</a>, with its dozens of major governmental institutions and millions of employees. Put simply, the theory says the president should be able to issue orders to subordinates and to <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300191394/the-unitary-executive/\">fire them</a> at will.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President Donal Trump appears seated in the oval office.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694158/original/file-20251002-96-nnpb17.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office next to a poster displaying the Trump Gold Card on Sept. 19, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Trump%20executive%20orders&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Alex Brandon</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The president could boss around the FBI or order the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.execfunctions.org/p/the-comey-indictment-and-its-aftermath\">attorney general to investigate his political opponents</a>, as Trump has done. The president could issue <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2005.00262.x\">signing statements</a> – a written pronouncement – that reinterpret or ignore parts of the laws, like George W. Bush did in 2006 to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/brett-kavanaugh-signing-statements.html\">circumvent a ban on torture</a>. The president could control <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/trump-order-power-independent-agencies-00204798\">independent agencies</a> such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The president might be able to force the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-trump-federal-reserve-lisa-cook-fired-10780042\">Federal Reserve</a> to change interest rates, as Trump has suggested. And the president might possess inherent power to <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1122&amp;context=jcl\">wage war as he sees fit</a> without a formal authorization from Congress, as officials argued during Bush’s presidency.</p>\n\n<h2>A constitutionally questionable doctrine</h2>\n\n<p>A theory is one thing. But if it gains the official endorsement of the Supreme Court, it can become governing orthodoxy. It appears to many observers and scholars that Trump’s actions have intentionally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-firings-officials-legal-test.html\">invited court cases</a> by which he hopes the judiciary will embrace the theory and thus permit him to do even more. And the current <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5478640/unitary-executive-theory-argues-to-restore-the-presidents-authority\">Supreme Court appears ready to grant that wish</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Until recently, the judiciary tended to indirectly address the claims that now appear more formally as the unitary executive theory. </p>\n\n<p>During the country’s first two centuries, courts touched on aspects of the theory in cases such as <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/37/524/\">Kendall v. U.S.</a> in 1838, which limited presidential control of the postmaster general, and <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/272/52/\">Myers v. U.S.</a> in 1926, which held that the president could remove a postmaster in Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>In 1935, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/602/\">Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</a>, the high court unanimously held that Congress could limit the president’s ability to fire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. And in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/\">Morrison v. Olson</a> the court in 1988 upheld the ability of Congress to limit the president’s ability to fire an independent counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those decisions aligned with some unitary executive claims, but others directly repudiated them.</p>\n\n<h2>Warming up to a unitary executive</h2>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=djclpp\">series of cases</a> over <a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-132/guidance-on-administrative-law-judges-after-lucia-v-sec-s-ct-july-2018/\">the past 15 years</a>, the Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psq.12773\">moved in an unambiguously unitarian, pro-presidential direction</a>. In these cases, the court has <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/Excerpts%20from%20Three%20Views%20of%20the%20Administrative%20State.pdf\">struck down statutory limits</a> on the president’s ability to remove federal officials, enabling much greater presidential control. </p>\n\n<p>These decisions clearly suggest that long-standing, anti-unitarian landmark decisions such as Humphrey’s are on increasingly thin ice. In fact, in Justice Clarence Thomas’ 2019 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf\">concurring opinion</a> in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/19-7\">Seila Law LLC v. CFPB</a>, where the court ruled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s leadership structure was unconstitutional, he articulated his desire to “repudiate” the “erroneous precedent” of Humphrey’s.</p>\n\n<p>Several cases from the court’s <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/stephen-vladeck/the-shadow-docket/9781541605183/?lens=basic-books\">emergency docket, or shadow docket</a>, in recent months indicate that other justices share that desire. Such cases do not require full arguments but can indicate where the court is headed.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-ignores-precedent-instead-of-overruling-it-in-allowing-president-to-fire-officials-whom-congress-tried-to-make-independent-257784\">Trump v. Wilcox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-trump-fire-members-product-safety-agency-rcna218882\">Trump v. Boyle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2025/09/25/supreme-court-allows-trump-to-fire-democrat-rebecca-slaughter-from-ftc-for-now/\">Trump v. Slaughter</a>, all from 2025, the court upheld Trump’s firing of officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. </p>\n\n<p>Previously, these officials had appeared to be protected from political interference.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694166/original/file-20251002-56-htcxkm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President George W.

Boyle, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a11_2cp3.pdf\">Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> wrote, “whether this Court will narrow or overrule a precedent … there is at least a fair prospect (not certainty, but at least a reasonable prospect) that we will do so.” And in her dissent in Trump v. Slaughter, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a264_o759.pdf\">Justice Elena Kagan</a> said the conservative majority was “raring” to overturn Humphrey’s and finally officially embrace the unitary executive.  </p>\n\n<p>In short, the writing is on the wall, and Humphrey’s may soon go the way of Roe v. Wade and other landmark decisions that had guided American life for decades.  </p>\n\n<p>As for what judicial endorsement of the unitary executive theory could mean in practice, Trump seems to hope it will mean total control and hence the ability to eradicate the so-called “<a href=\"https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/phantoms-beleaguered-republic-deep-state-and-unitary-executive\">deep state</a>.” Other conservatives hope it will diminish the government’s regulatory role.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf\">Kagan recently warned</a> it could mean the end of administrative governance – the ways that the federal government provides services, oversees businesses and enforces the law – as we know it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Humphrey’s undergirds a significant feature of American governance: bipartisan administrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with a measure of independence from presidential control. Congress created them … out of one basic vision. It thought that in certain spheres of government, a group of knowledgeable people from both parties – none of whom a President could remove without cause – would make decisions likely to advance the long-term public good.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the Supreme Court officially makes the chief executive a unitary executive, the advancement of the public good may depend on little more than the whims of the president, a state of affairs normally <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/law/specter-dictatorship\">more characteristic of dictatorship than democracy</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265840/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Graham G.

Many had helped <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-Rights-Mankind-History-American/dp/0945612281\">create state constitutions that included</a> pioneering bills of rights. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/oc/stc/entries/the-virginia-declaration-of-rights-june-12-1776\">Madison himself played a critical role</a> in securing passage in 1776 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a monument to civil liberties.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the Constitutional Convention met, however, Madison had soured on such measures. During the 1780s, he had watched with alarm as <a href=\"https://pjm.as.virginia.edu/sites/pjm.as.virginia.edu/files/inline-files/vices-political-system-linked-pages.pdf\">state legislatures trampled on rights</a> explicitly guaranteed by their constitutions. Bills of rights, he concluded, weren’t sufficient to protect rights.</p>\n\n<p>So Madison and his colleagues <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-framers-coup-9780199942039?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">put their faith in reinventing government</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>No appetite to haggle</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution\">The Constitution</a> they wrote created a government powerful enough to promote the national interests while maintaining a check on state legislatures. It also established a system of checks and balances that ensured federal power wasn’t abused.</p>\n\n<p>In the convention’s waning days, delegates briefly discussed adding a bill of rights but unanimously <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/farrand-the-records-of-the-federal-convention-of-1787-vol-2\">decided against it</a>. They had sweated through almost four months of a sweltering Philadelphia summer and were ready to go home. When Virginia’s John Rutledge noted “the extreme anxiety of many members of the Convention to <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/farrand-the-records-of-the-federal-convention-of-1787-vol-2\">bring the business to an end</a>,” he was stating the obvious. With the Constitution in final form, few had the appetite to haggle over the provisions of a bill of rights.  </p>\n\n<p>That decision <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">nearly proved fatal</a> when the Constitution went to the states for ratification. </p>\n\n<p>The new Constitution’s supporters, <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/federalists/\">known as Federalists</a>, faced fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists who charged that a powerful national government, unrestrained by a bill of rights, would inevitably lead to tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>Ratification conventions in <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">three of the most critical states</a> – Massachusetts, New York and Virginia – were narrowly divided; ratification hung in the balance. Federalists resisted demands to make ratification contingent on amendments suggested by state conventions. But they agreed to add a bill of rights – after the Constitution was ratified and took effect.</p>\n\n<p>That concession did the trick. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A poster featuring an image of Colonial men and boys in a blacksmith shop, with 'Our Bill of Rights IS EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS' written on it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=861&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694678/original/file-20251006-56-sgohnz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1081&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A poster from 1959, published by the U.S. government, about the First Amendment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://reagan.blogs.archives.gov/2022/07/28/constitutional-amendments-series-amendment-i-the-freedom-of-speech/\">Stanley Dersh citizenship poster, U.S. Government Publishing Office via Reagan Library</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Harmless, possibly helpful</h2>\n\n<p>The three critical states <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ratification/Pauline-Maier/9780684868554\">ratified without condition</a>, and by midsummer 1788, the Constitution had been approved. </p>\n\n<p>However, when the First Congress met in March 1789, the Federalist majority <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-framers-coup-9780199942039?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">didn’t prioritize</a> a bill of rights. They had won and were ready to move on.</p>\n\n<p>Madison, now a Federalist leader in the House of Representatives, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">insisted that his party keep its word</a>. He warned that failure to do so would undermine trust in the new government and give Anti-Federalists ammunition to demand a new convention to do what Congress had left undone.</p>\n\n<p>But Madison wasn’t just arguing for his party keeping its word. He had also changed his mind.  </p>\n\n<p>The ratification debates and Madison’s correspondence with Thomas Jefferson led him to think differently about a bill of rights. He now thought it harmless and possibly helpful. Its provisions, Madison conceded, might become “<a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/01-11-02-0218\">fundamental maxims of a free government</a>” and part of “the national sentiment.” Broad popular support for a bill of rights might provide a check on government officials and how they wielded power.</p>\n\n<p>Madison <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">pushed his colleagues</a> relentlessly. Wary of provisions that would weaken the national government, he developed a slate of amendments focused on individual rights. Ultimately, Congress <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">approved 12 amendments</a> – ensuring rights from freedom of speech to protection from cruel and unusual punishment – and sent them to the states for ratification. </p>\n\n<h2>First Amendment no cure-all</h2>\n\n<p>By the end of 1791, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/james-madison-and-the-struggle-for-the-bill-of-rights-9780195181050?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">10 of them – including the First Amendment ≠ had been ratified</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As Madison anticipated, the First Amendment wasn’t a cure for a government bent on suppressing dissent. From the <a href=\"https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700617654/\">Sedition Act</a> in the 1790s to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ageofmccarthyism0000schr_a8c6/ageofmccarthyism0000schr_a8c6\">McCarthyism</a> in the 1950s and the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/harvard-like-all-americans-cant-be-punished-by-the-government-for-speaking-freely-and-a-federal-court-decision-upholds-decades-of-precedents-saying-so-264743\">Trump administration’s</a> assault on the First Amendment, government has used its awesome powers to pursue and punish critics. </p>\n\n<p>On occasion, <a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/in-landmark-ruling-federal-court-says-trump-administration-violated-first-amendment-by-deporting-foreign-citizens-for-pro-palestinian-advocacy\">courts have intervened to protect First Amendment rights</a>, a weapon Madison didn’t anticipate. But <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us211\">not always</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the ultimate protection for First Amendment rights is “national sentiment,” as Madison suggested. Norm-breaking presidents can disregard the law, and judges may cave. But public sentiment is a powerful force, as Jimmy Kimmel can attest.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266639/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Donald Nieman receives funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.

It means scraping snow and ice off your car in frigid mornings. And it means making a lifelong vow to the city’s NFL franchise, the Bills – for better or worse, till death do us part. </p>\n\n<p>When I grew up in New York’s second-largest city, my community was bound together by loyalty to a football team <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6086560/2025/01/25/buffalo-bills-underdog-story-afc-championship-chiefs/\">that always found new ways to break our hearts</a>. And yet at the start of each NFL season, we always found reasons to hope – we couldn’t help ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Coming from this football-crazed culture, I often wondered about the psychology of fandom. This eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D. in sport consumer behavior. As a doctoral student, I was most interested in one question: Is fandom good for us?</p>\n\n<p>I found a huge body of research on the psychological and social effects of fandom, and it certainly made being devoted to a team look good. Fandom <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2010-23158-001.html\">builds belonging</a>, helps adults <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.27.4.271\">make friends</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-018-0068-9\">boosts happiness</a> and even provides a buffer against <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/gdn0000019\">traumatic life events</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, fandom is great, right?</p>\n\n<p>As famed football commentator Lee Corso would say: “<a href=\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/not-so-fast-my-friend-a-lee-corso-special-to-debut-august-22-on-espn-in-advance-of-the-legendary-analysts-final-college-gameday-show/\">Not so fast, my friend</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>While fandom appears to be a boon for our mental health, <a href=\"https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsm/29/6/article-p705.xml\">strikingly little research</a> had been conducted on the relationship between fandom and physical health.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to conduct a series of studies – mainly of people in Western countries – on this topic. I found that being a sports fan can have some drawbacks for physical health, especially among the most committed fans.</p>\n\n<h2>Reach for the nachos</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-10-98\">Playing sports is healthy</a>. But watching them? Not so much.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgating culture revolves around alcohol. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00296-9\">Research shows</a> that college sports fans binge drink at significantly higher rates than nonfans, are more likely to do something they later regretted and are more likely to drive drunk. Meanwhile, watch parties encourage <a href=\"https://www.profootballnetwork.com/how-long-is-a-football-game-breaking-down-the-time-between-the-first-and-last-whistle/\">being stationary for hours</a> and mindlessly snacking. And, of course, fandom goes hand in hand with heavily processed foods like wings, nachos, pizza and hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p>One fan told me that when watching games, his relationship with food is “almost Pavlovian”; he craves “decadent” foods the same way he seeks out popcorn at the movies.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694640/original/file-20251006-56-ucqs5y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of leather chairs filled with men, many of whom have multiple beers on their side tables.

One Gen Z fan I recently interviewed griped, “You might find one salad with a plain piece of lettuce and a quarter of a tomato.”</p>\n\n<h2>Eating away the anxiety and pain</h2>\n\n<p>The relationship between fandom and physical health isn’t just about guzzling beer, sitting for hours on end or scarfing down hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613481232\">One study</a> analyzed sales from grocery stores. The researchers found that fans consume more calories – and less healthy food – on the day following a loss by their favorite team, a reaction the researchers tied to stress and disappointment. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I found something similar: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14413523.2023.2260940\">Fandom induces</a> what’s called “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2024.101133\">emotional eating</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Emotions like anger, sadness and disappointment <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.724220\">lead to stronger cravings</a>. And this relationship is tied to how your favorite team performs when it matters most. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/IJSMS-07-2024-0165\">we found</a> that games between rivals and closely contested games yield more pronounced effects. Emotional states generated by the game are also <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4569227\">significantly correlated</a> with increased beer sales in the stadium.</p>\n\n<h2>High-calorie cultures</h2>\n\n<p>In another paper, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.2021-0128\">my co-authors and I found</a> that fans often feel torn between their desire to make healthy choices and their commitment to being a “true fan.”</p>\n\n<p>Every fan base develops its own culture. These unwritten rules <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2017.09.002\">vary from team to team</a>, and they aren’t just about wearing <a href=\"https://media.gettyimages.com/id/81347320/photo/united-states-football-closeup-of-green-bay-packers-fans-during-game-vs-detroit-lions-green-bay.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=gi&amp;k=20&amp;c=a8Gl4Ft7pbIHaYqgZtSipkLVKOKoMF209FTHCaYHJto=\">a cheesehead hat</a> or waving <a href=\"https://www.steelers.com/history/terrible-towel/\">a Terrible Towel</a>. They also include expectations around drinking, eating and lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p>These health-related norms are shaped by a variety of factors, including the region’s culture, team history and even team sponsorships.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Cincinnati Bengals <a href=\"https://www.bengals.com/news/skyline-chili-bengals-partner-2023\">partner with Skyline Chili</a>, a regional chain that makes a meat sauce that’s often poured over hot dogs or spaghetti. One Bengals fan I interviewed observed that if you attend a Bengals game, sure, you could eat something else – but a “true fan” eats Skyline.</p>\n\n<p>I have two studies in progress that show <a href=\"https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/18457\">how hardcore fans</a> typically align their health behaviors with the health norms of their fan base. This becomes a way to signal their <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uk8AFpo3BnYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=An+integrative+theory+of+intergroup+conflict&amp;ots=qNI87XhAxf&amp;sig=KSdOjkvfUwYi939OGFZ0F2WUwo8#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20integrative%20theory%20of%20intergroup%20conflict&amp;f=false\">allegiance to the team</a>, improve their standing among fellow fans, and contribute to <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-98657-000\">what makes the fan base distinct</a> in the eyes of its members.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two shirtless fans, one wearing a cheesehead hat, another wearing a helmet with antlers.

As one fan explained: “People make a bunch of fried food or huge pots of gumbo or étouffée, and eat all day – from hours before the game until hours after.”</p>\n\n<h2>A new generation of health-conscious fans</h2>\n\n<p>The fan experience is shaped by the culture in which it is embedded. Teams actively help shape these cultures, and there’s a business argument to be had for teams to play a bigger role in changing some of these norms.</p>\n\n<p>Gen Z is <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/%7E/media/mckinsey/email/genz/2024/01/2024-01-23d.html\">strikingly health-conscious</a>. They’re also <a href=\"https://pro.morningconsult.com/articles/gen-z-poll-sports-fandom\">less engaged with traditional fandom</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If stadiums and tailgates continue to revolve around beer and nachos, why would a generation attuned to fitness influencers and “<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seeking-fitspiration-on-social-media-202401033004\">fitspiration</a>” buy in? To reach this market, I think the sports industry will need to <a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2023/oct/gen-z-reshaping-professional-sports-economics.html\">promote its professional sports teams in new ways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some teams are already doing so. The British soccer team Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/lfc-partnership\">has partnered</a> with the exercise equipment company Peloton. Another club, Manchester City, has <a href=\"https://www.mancity.com/news/club/manchester-city-asahi-training-kit-announcement-63824000\">teamed up</a> with a nonalcoholic beer brand as the official sponsor of its practice uniforms.</p>\n\n<p>And several European soccer clubs have even joined a “<a href=\"https://healthystadia.eu/\">Healthy Stadia</a>” movement, revamping in-stadium food options and encouraging fans to walk and bike to the stadium.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I don’t think the solution is replacing typical fan foods with smoothies and salads. Alienating core consumers is generally <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/002224299405800404\">not a sound business strategy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I think it’s reasonable, however, to suggest sports teams might add more healthy options and carefully evaluate the signals they send through sponsorships.</p>\n\n<p>As one fan I recently interviewed said: “The NFL has had half-assed efforts like Play 60” – a campaign encouraging kids to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day – “while also making a ton of money from beer, food and, back in the day, cigarette advertisements. How can sports leagues seriously expect people to be healthier if they promote unhealthy behaviors?”</p>\n\n<p>Today’s consumers <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353835/gen-z-shoppers-are-choosing-brands-that-reflect-their-values?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">want to support brands</a> that reflect their values. This is particularly true for Gen Zers, many of whom are savvy enough to see through hollow campaigns and quick to reject hypocrisy. In the long run, I think this type of dissonance – sandwiching a Play 60 commercial between <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250320/Researchers-warn-meal-delivery-apps-could-undermine-global-nutrition-effortse28094heree28099s-how.aspx?\">ads for Uber Eats</a> and Anheuser-Busch – will prove counterproductive.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three people dressed up in hot dog costumes – one green, one red and one yellow – race during a baseball game.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694594/original/file-20251006-56-3phfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Relish, ketchup and mustard ‘race’ during a September 2025 baseball game between the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Mariners – an encapsulation of the dissonance between showcasing both physical activity and junk food at sporting events.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/relish-mustard-and-ketchup-compete-in-the-hot-dog-derby-news-photo/2235290568?adppopup=true\">Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>I, as much as anyone else, understand what makes fandom special – and yes, I’ve eaten my share of wings during Bills games. But public health is a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-06-2025-new-data--noncommunicable-diseases-cause-1-8-million-avoidable-deaths-and-cost-us-514-billion-USD-every-year--reveals-new-who-europe-report\">pressing concern</a>, and though the sports industry is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.21.3.297\">well-positioned to address this issue</a>, fandom isn’t helping. Actually, my research suggests it’s having the opposite effect.</p>\n\n<p>Striking the balance I’m advocating will be tricky, but the sports industry is filled with bright problem-solvers. In the film “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/\">Moneyball</a>,” Brad Pitt’s character, Billy Beane, famously says sports teams must “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugN5aD5p2NU\">adapt or die</a>.” He was referring to the need for baseball teams to integrate analytics into their decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Professional sports teams eventually got that message. Maybe they’ll get this one, too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265158/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Aaron Mansfield does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Instead of landing a job and moving to the big city after graduation, many are moving back into their childhood homes instead. About <a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Fdemo%2Ftables%2Ffamilies%2Ftime-series%2Fadults%2Fad1.xls&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK\">1.5 million more adults under 35</a> live with their parents today than a decade ago. That’s a 6.3% jump, more than double the rate of growth for the young adult population overall.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is affordability. Over the past decade, urban rents have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEHA\">climbed about 4% per year</a>, while wages for full-time workers have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881900Q\">increased by only 0.6% annually</a>. That means it’s harder than ever to live in a big city on the typical salary – especially if you’re a new graduate without much work experience.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is even more challenging for aspiring homeowners: The median house price in the U.S. has risen about <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI\">90% in just 10 years</a>, or more than 6% each year. And as prices rise – the median home sells for <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\">more than $400,000</a> now – so too do the ages of homebuyers. The median first-time U.S. homebuyer is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/many-first-time-homebuyers-are-pushing-40-millennials-wait-vain-better-rcna201786\">38 years old</a>, up from <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/interactive-maps-median-age-of-home-buyers-2003-2013\">31 about a decade ago</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is the rent so high?</h2>\n\n<p>Put simply, there isn’t enough housing. <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/rpshah1.php\">As an economist</a>, I know that when demand rises faster than supply, prices have to increase. And supply is severely limited in the places where people most want to live: big cities such as <a href=\"https://edc.nyc/housing-crisis-and-new-york-city\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/regional-housing-need-san-francisco-bay-area/\">San Francisco</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In most of these cities, planning and zoning laws prevent developers from building enough to meet demand. For example, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3792544\">rezoning a plot of land</a> from commercial to residential often requires mountains of paperwork. And in many cities, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/business/single-family-zoning-laws\">objections from neighbors</a> can stall a proposed development. These are just two of many obstacles local governments throw in homebuilders’ way. </p>\n\n<p>One city that has tried something different is Austin, Texas. After <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/22/austin-texas-rents-falling/\">deliberately relaxing its zoning laws</a> a few years ago, Austin has seen <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2025/03/25/austins-property-boom-brings-bolder-new-build-luxury-to-a-balanced-market/\">a boom in home construction</a>. Rents fell by 10% in one year and by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-27/austin-rents-tumble-22-from-peak-on-massive-home-building-spree?srnd=homepage-americas\">as much as 22%</a> in two years after that change. By making it easier to build, Austin has made it cheaper to live there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Austin has a far lower share of its young adults living with their parents than many other cities do. <a href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/living-at-home-study/\">Just 6% of working adults</a> in the Austin metro area live with their parents, one analysis found, versus nearly 14% in Greater San Antonio and 20% in Greater Los Angeles. </p>\n\n<h2>The pros and cons of living with the ’rents</h2>\n\n<p>One obvious advantage of living with parents is that they tend to charge below-market rents, or nothing at all. That makes it easier to save for a deposit on a house, helping young adults get on the property ladder sooner than they would otherwise. Indeed, homeownership rates among those 25 to 34 have <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CXU980230LB0403M#:%7E:text=Table_content:%20header:%20%7C%202023:%20%7C%2033%20%7C,%7C%202023::%202019:%20%7C%2033:%2033%20%\">risen slightly since 2016</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also potential disadvantages, however, particularly when it comes to socializing. Living at home with parents can make it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/dating-while-living-with-parents/620699/\">much more challenging</a> to <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-challenges-of-dating-while-living-at-home-with-your-parents\">meet new people</a>. This, in turn, could partly help explain why <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/families-and-households/ms-2.pdf\">Americans are getting married</a> and <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/geriatric-pregnancy-increases-complication-rate\">having children later in life</a>. These delays might not seem important, but they can leave people feeling like they’re behind in life, which can affect their health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>I also wonder whether living with parents is indirectly making young adults unhappier at work. That’s because older adults often live <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2473\">far from the urban centers</a> where <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/\">young people are most likely to find jobs</a> directly related to their degrees. Job satisfaction rates are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/25/young-workers-express-lower-levels-of-job-satisfaction-than-older-ones-but-most-are-content-with-their-job/\">substantially lower among 18- to 29-year-olds</a> than among the rest of the working population.</p>\n\n<h2>A problem for the entire US</h2>\n\n<p>The housing shortage isn’t just an issue for young adults. A recent analysis I found insightful was headlined “<a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/\">The housing theory of everything</a>.” It argued that the issue helps explain at least part of the current malaise in the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when people can’t live and work where they want, they’re unable to use their talents fully. That contributes to the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006092\">relatively slow productivity growth</a> the U.S. has experienced in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if people can’t live in areas where they might meet and work with like-minded individuals, they have fewer opportunities to share ideas, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-59517-1.00006-4\">which can hinder innovation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And if the housing shortage is indeed encouraging young adults to delay having children, it could make it harder for the U.S. to fund Social Security and other government programs in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Making it easier to build new homes in places people want to live and work could go a long way to easing these problems. It’s possible high rents translate into high barriers to adulthood, too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264570/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I am acquaintances with the authors of the article &quot;The Housing Theory of Everything.&quot;</span></em></p>",

Democratic leaders countered that <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403\">the subsidies are not a new demand</a> but rather the continuation of a program that has <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">helped keep record numbers of Americans insured since the pandemic</a> – and therefore that the issue could not be delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a standoff that blends fiscal and policy disagreements – a hallmark of contemporary budget politics.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://law.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/wendy-netter-epstein.aspx\">experts</a> in <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/christopher-robertson/\">health law</a>, we see this issue as simple but consequential from a legal standpoint. Congress authorized the enhanced subsidies in 2021, originally to cushion the economic fallout from COVID-19 for families, and extended them through 2025 in the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Without new legislation, the subsidies revert to pre-2021 levels on Jan. 1, 2026 – which would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/insurers-preliminary-rate-filings-anticipate-biggest-increases-in-aca-marketplace-plan-premiums-since-2018/\">jump in the cost of health insurance</a> and would make <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced subsidies explained</h2>\n\n<p>Most Americans under age 65 get insurance through their employers, which the federal government <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-exclusion-employer-sponsored-health-insurance-work\">subsidizes by making it tax-free</a>. Medicare, the program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the program that mainly serves low-income Americans, are heavily supported by subsidies too. </p>\n\n<p>But as of 2025, about <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/over-24-million-consumers-selected-affordable-health-coverage-aca-marketplace-2025\">1 in 6 people</a> under age 65 do not have access to this coverage, including many small-business owners and tradespeople, as well as part-time workers and those in the gig economy. For them, unsubsidized health insurance can be prohibitively expensive. </p>\n\n<p>To address this affordability problem, the ACA provided for households earning between 100% and 400% of the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">federal poverty level</a> to receive subsidies for purchasing policies on the ACA marketplace, effectively lowering premiums. The original law limited subsidies only to those making under 400% of the federal poverty level, which is, for a family of four in 2025, around US$128,000 per year. A family making $129,000 a year, however, would have to pay full price. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Family in the kitchen, mom cooks dinner as daughter watches.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694679/original/file-20251006-56-38igeb.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">If the current ACA subsidies expire, almost 5 million people are likely to lose their health insurance coverage.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mother-and-daughter-cooking-together-at-home-royalty-free-image/1390904687\">FG Trade/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan\">American Rescue Plan</a> temporarily made two major changes in 2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It removed the 400%-of-poverty eligibility ceiling, extending help to many middle-income families. </p></li>\n<li><p>It capped the maximum household contribution at 8.5% of income for everyone, ensuring affordability regardless of income. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these reforms expire in 2026, the Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48290\">must revert to the older, less generous formula</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What the subsidies accomplished</h2>\n\n<p>The enhanced subsidies drove <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2025-open-enrollment-period-report-national-snapshot-2\">ACA marketplace participation to historic highs</a> – more than 24 million people selected plans for 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020. The Department of Health and Human Services found <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cddf36b40446d0052bed0af2ff9d9012/race-ethnicity-marketplace-2024-oep-ib.pdf\">disproportionate enrollment gains among Black and Latino Americans</a>, helping to reduce racial disparities in coverage.</p>\n\n<p>For many low-income enrollees, mid-level plans – <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/silver-health-plan/\">called silver plans in the ACA marketplace</a> – effectively became free. Middle-income families who previously earned just above the cutoff gained meaningful relief, sometimes saving thousands of dollars a year.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens if subsidies expire?</h2>\n\n<p>Analysts broadly agree that returning to the pre-2021 rules would mean large <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/insurers-preliminary-rate-filings-anticipate-biggest-increases-in-aca-marketplace-plan-premiums-since-2018/\">cost increases</a> and <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/if-health-insurance-subsidies-end-people-could-see-higher-prices-coverage-loss/\">coverage losses</a>. On average, the premiums that Americans will pay for ACA marketplace plans would <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">more than double</a>. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket premiums for an individual would jump from about $888 in 2025 to $1,900 in 2026. </p>\n\n<p>With these increases, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/changes-health-care-spending-and-uncompensated-care-under-enhanced-tax-credit\">Urban Institute</a>,  a think tank, projects that 7.3 million fewer people would receive subsidized marketplace coverage and 4.8 million more would become uninsured.</p>\n\n<p>This is highly consequential, as research shows that insurance coverage <a href=\"https://nihcm.org/publications/does-having-health-insurance-coverage-reduce-mortality\">saves lives by ensuring access to care</a>. Knocking nearly 5 million people off insurance may cause as many as <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf\">500 additional deaths per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Losses would disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. Free premium plans would disappear. Those making below 250% of the federal poverty level could see their net premiums rise more than fourfold, while those between 250% and 400% would see their premiums double. What’s more, rural Americans, already under pressure from the state of the economy, <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans\">face higher risks</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CyyCi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CyyCi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The fiscal and policy trade-offs</h2>\n\n<p>On the flip side, making the enhanced credits permanent would <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61734\">add about US$350 billion to federal deficits between 2026 and 2035</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates. Proponents argue that the <a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/the-price-of-obamacare-subsidies-loss-millions-uninsured-thousands-at-greater-risk/\">cost is justified by reduced medical debt</a>, fewer uninsured, greater household stability and ultimately saving lives. Short-term savings from cutting the subsidies would also lead to higher health care costs, longer-term. But critics worry it’s a <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/cbo-jct-asked-about-impacts-of-making-health-insurance-premium-tax-credit-permanent/\">broad and expensive way to support affordability</a>, benefiting some higher-income households that could otherwise afford coverage, even though it would cost more than 8.5% of their income. </p>\n\n<p>Another concern is how the subsidies affect price competition. Under the ACA, the government pays most of the difference between what a household is expected to contribute and the actual cost of a standard benchmark plan. That means if health insurance companies raise their premiums, those who receive subsidies don’t feel the effect of the premium increases, because the federal subsidy simply grows to cover it. That means companies have fewer reasons to compete on price.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and administrative constraints</h2>\n\n<p>Because the subsidies are written into the tax code, only Congress can extend them or make them permanent. The question of whether to renew them was already debated strenuously when Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">big tax and spending package</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. By omitting the subsidies, the bill effectively raised health care costs for millions of middle-income Americans. States that run their own marketplaces may add some aid, but few can match the scale of federal support. </p>\n\n<p>Administrative timing matters too. The IRS, health insurers and the online marketplace all need to know how the subsidy amounts will be calculated – in other words, which income limits and premium caps Congress wants to use. These figures determine how much financial help people get when they sign up for coverage. Late or temporary fixes can create confusion for both consumers and administrators.</p>\n\n<h2>Options before Congress</h2>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have several options, each with different trade-offs. </p>\n\n<p>A permanent extension would provide stability for consumers and insurers – but at the cost of higher long-term federal spending. A short-term renewal of one to four years could soften the immediate jump in premiums while giving Congress time to reassess the policy, but it would continue the cycle of temporary fixes.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2025/07/30/aca-subsidy-extension-changes\">targeted approach</a> might preserve the larger subsidies for lower-income households but gradually reduce assistance for higher earners so that they aren’t guaranteed a cap of 8.5% of their income for insurance. This would make the policy more fiscally restrained but less universal.</p>\n\n<p>Some legislators have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/offsetting-aca-enhanced-subsidy-extensions\">offsetting the cost of ACA subsidies</a> by pairing an extension with savings elsewhere in the health system. Those savings could come from trimming what the government pays insurers to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or by reducing Medicare payments to doctors.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these options reflects a different balance among affordability, fiscal responsibility and administrative simplicity. Together, they highlight how difficult it is to design a policy that meets all three goals at once.</p>\n\n<h2>A structural challenge</h2>\n\n<p>The problem isn’t just political – it’s built into how time-limited programs like the enhanced ACA subsidies are designed. The subsidies <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/conservatives-backed-the-ideas-behind-obamacare-so-how-did-they-come-to-hate-it-149698\">have always reflected partisan divides</a>, but their temporary nature makes those divides even sharper. Lawmakers limited them to a few years to keep costs down, but that choice now means Congress has to reopen the same debate every year.</p>\n\n<p>When deadlines for renewing programs collide with larger funding fights, important benefits can lapse, not because lawmakers chose to end them but because the fights over broader spending leave little room for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it’s up to Congress to decide not only whether these subsidies continue, but whether big social policies like this should be settled through last-minute budget showdowns. For now, getting the government running and keeping health insurance affordable are part of the same fight.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266851/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Wendy Netter Epstein is a member of the Illinois Health Benefits Exchange Advisory Committee. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher Robertson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This concept is called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27174/\">self-tolerance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists thought self-tolerance was primarily established in the parts of the body that make immune cells, such as the thymus for T cells and the bone marrow for B cells. There, newly created immune cells that attack “self” are eliminated during development through a process called <a href=\"https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/18-3-t-lymphocytes-and-cellular-immunity\">central tolerance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, some of these self-reactive immune cells escape this process of elimination and are released into the rest of the body. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7636184/\">Sakaguchi’s 1995 discovery</a> of a new class of immune cells, called regulatory T cells, or Tregs, revealed another layer of protection: peripheral tolerance. These cells act as security guards of the immune system, patrolling the body and suppressing rogue immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram showing Tregs interacting with effector T cells and dendritic cells through various signaling molecules\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Regulatory T cells suppress immune responses using a variety of molecular signals.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mechanisms_of_suppression_by_regulatory_T_cells.png\">Giwlz/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While Sakaguchi identified the cells, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/83784\">Brunkow and Ramsdell</a> in 2001 uncovered the molecular key that controls them. They found that mutations in a gene called FOXP3 caused a fatal autoimmune disorder in mice. They later showed that similar mutations in humans lead to immune dysregulation and a rare and severe autoimmune disease called <a href=\"https://primaryimmune.org/understanding-primary-immunodeficiency/types-of-pi/ipex-syndrome\">IPEX syndrome</a>, short for immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome. This disease results from missing or malfunctioning regulatory T cells.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Sakaguchi confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1079490\">FOXP3 is essential</a> for the development of regulatory T cells. FOXP3 codes for a type of protein called a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13290\">transcription factor</a>, meaning it helps turn on the genes necessary for regulatory T cells to develop and function. Without this protein, these cells either don’t form or fail to suppress harmful immune responses. </p>\n\n<h2>Harnessing the immune system for medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Regulatory T cells can be heroes or villains, depending on the context. When regulatory T cells don’t work, it can lead to disease. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-00994-x\">breakdown in immune tolerance</a> can result in autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks healthy tissues. Conversely, in cancer, regulatory T cells can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-019-0175-7\">too effective in suppressing immune responses</a> that might otherwise destroy tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how FOXP3 and regulatory T cells work launched a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cei/uxad009\">new era in immunotherapies</a> that harness the immune system to treat autoimmune diseases and cancer. For autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116440\">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2025.08.004\">Type 1 diabetes</a>, researchers are exploring ways to boost the function of Tregs. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2022.06.008\">For cancer</a>, the goal is to inhibit Tregs, allowing the immune system to target tumors more aggressively.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of immune activation scale in the shape of a rainbow wedge, with 'vulnerable to infection' at the smaller end, 'sweet spot' in the middle, and 'autoimmunity' at the larger end\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Too much or too little immune activation can lead to illness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inflammation_scale.svg\">Kevbonham/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond disease treatment, this research may also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1099\">improve organ transplantation</a>, where immune tolerance is crucial to prevent rejection.

His reporting, aired on multiple episodes of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@PabloTorreFindsOut\">Pablo Torre Finds Out</a>,” focused on star forward <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/player/202695/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Leonard, one of the NBA’s most sought-after free agents, signed a four-year, US$176 million contract renewal with the Clippers during the 2021-22 off-season – the maximum allowed under league rules at the time. But Torre reported that in early 2022, Leonard’s LLC, KL2 Aspire, signed a cash and equity deal amounting to roughly $50 million through a brand sponsorship <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/04/01/climate-tech-startup-with-celebrity-and-billionaire-backers-files-for-bankruptcy/\">with Aspiration</a>, a now-bankrupt financial technology startup that marketed itself as a climate-friendly bank.</p>\n\n<p>Torre highlighted how the sponsorship coincided with major investments in Aspiration by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and another team investor. The arrangement, Torre suggested, looked less like a conventional endorsement deal and more like a “no-show” side payment that could have helped the Clippers keep their star without technically violating the salary cap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/30/sport/basketball-nba-kawhi-leonard-denies-wrongdoing-clippers-intl\">Leonard has denied</a> that the partnership was improper, insisting he fulfilled his contractual obligations. <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-03/basketball-nba-kawhi-leonard-clippers-salary-cap-drama-explained/105838906\">The Clippers</a> <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/clippers-steve-ballmer-denies-claim-team-skirted-nba-salary-cap-rules-kawhi-leonard-endorsement-deal\">and Ballmer</a> have also rejected claims of wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Torre’s reporting nevertheless had an immediate impact. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46146871/report-clippers-skirted-nba-salary-cap-kawhi-leonard-payment\">Major outlets picked up the story</a>, Aspiration’s bankruptcy filings drew renewed scrutiny, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/nba-launches-investigation-into-alleged-kawhi-leonard-no-show-endorsement-deal-to-skirt-salary-cap\">the NBA announced it was investigating the matter</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i3TQEQr3Yk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In the wake of Pablo Torre’s revelations, many legacy media outlets highlighted his reporting.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>At the University of Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.jou.ufl.edu\">College of Journalism &amp; Communications</a>, part of my research involves unpacking the importance of decentralized networks of local outlets that cover stories from underrepresented areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p>I see Torre’s work as a clear example of the growing need for this kind of <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/social-media-influences-mainstream-media\">bottom-up</a>, citizen journalism – particularly given media industry trends.</p>\n\n<h2>An eroding fourth estate</h2>\n\n<p>Watchdog journalism is supposed to hold power to account.</p>\n\n<p>This is sometimes referred to as the “fourth estate.” A term that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/152263791101300102\">dates back to the 17th century</a>, it reflects the idea that an independent press is supposed to act as a fourth pillar of power, alongside <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/three-branches/three-branches-of-government\">the three traditional branches</a> of modern democracies – legislative, executive and judicial. </p>\n\n<p>Proudly independent from political or financial influence, fourth estate news media has <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/reviving-the-fourth-estate/A4A8E31ACE63C7E46520364465D2AE5C\">traditionally</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/14648849231176110\">demonstrated</a> a public service commitment to exposing corruption, encouraging debate, highlighting issues that are important and forcing leaders to address those issues. </p>\n\n<p>The need for watchdog journalism appears more urgent than ever. </p>\n\n<p>In the Western world, with <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/news/press-release-restrictions-to-freedom-of-expression-as-democracy-loses-ground/\">authoritarianism on the rise</a>, the fourth estate is experiencing widespread threats. Reporters Without Borders’ latest <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/rsf-world-press-freedom-index-2025-economic-fragility-leading-threat-press-freedom\">World Press Freedom Index</a> found that global press freedom reached an all-time low in 2025.

Fierce competition for clicks, eyeballs and ad revenue impacts the type of content and stories that commercial outlets tend to focus on. </p>\n\n<p>There appears to be less and less of a financial incentive to put in the time, resources and effort required for deep investigative reporting. It’s just not worth the return on that investment for commercial outfits.</p>\n\n<h2>A full-court press</h2>\n\n<p>In the U.S., the Trump administration and media consolidations have further weakened the press’s ability to serve as a check on those in power.  </p>\n\n<p>Over the past year, two major TV networks — ABC and CBS — reached settlements for separate lawsuits brought forward by President Donald Trump tied to editorial choices on their broadcast programming. Needless to say, both decisions create significant precedents <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/abc-and-cbs-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief/\">that could prove consequential</a> for journalistic integrity and independence.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/h-r-4-and-h-r-517-signed-into-law-s-1582/\">the GOP-led Congress</a> stripped over $1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, dealing a blow to public nonprofit outlets NPR, PBS and their local affiliates.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah <a href=\"https://karenattiah.substack.com/p/the-washington-post-fired-me-but\">lost her job</a> after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/business/media/washington-post-karen-attiah.html\">speaking out</a> against gun violence on social media in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.</p>\n\n<p>From a structural standpoint, the U.S. media ownership landscape has, for decades, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-slippery-slope-of-the-oligarchy-media-model-81931\">been plagued by consolidation</a>. Media channels have become merely one slice of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/even-as-jimmy-kimmel-returns-to-the-airwaves-tv-networks-remain-more-vulnerable-to-political-pressure-than-ever-before-265653\">massive asset portfolios</a> of the conglomerates that control them.</p>\n\n<p>It’s probably fair to say that producing costly and burdensome watchdog journalism isn’t exactly a priority for busy executives at the top of these holding companies.</p>\n\n<h2>What about local media?</h2>\n\n<p>Independent local outlets are a dying breed, too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cislm.org/research/u-s-news-deserts/\">Studies have shown</a> that <a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/news-deserts-and-ghost-newspapers-will-local-news-survive/\">news deserts</a> – areas with little or no local coverage – are multiplying across the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>This has dire consequences for democratic governance: News deserts <a href=\"https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2023/\">often correlate</a> with lower civic engagement, reduced voter turnout and less accountability for business and political leaders.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, fewer local journalists means less scrutiny of <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/how-the-decline-of-local-news-threatens-local-democracy\">local governments</a>, which undermines transparency and <a href=\"https://niemanreports.org/less-local-news-means-less-democracy/\">enables corruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, more readers seem to be getting their news from social media and podcasts. In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/25/1-in-5-americans-now-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-up-sharply-from-2020/\">a new Pew Research Center report</a>, 1 in 5 Americans get their news from TikTok alone.

You feel the wind blowing and see clouds move across the sky. Sometimes there are storms where the wind gets really strong, it might rain, or there might be thunder and lightning.</p>\n\n<p>Did you know that there’s weather in space too? It all starts with the Sun.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sun: The bright star in our solar system</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/en/\">The Sun</a> is a very hot, very big ball of gas at the center of our solar system. <a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/surface.shtml\">Its surface</a> can reach a blistering 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). That’s nearly five times hotter than lava that spews from volcanoes on Earth, and just like lava, the Sun glows from the heat.</p>\n\n<p>The Sun <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/big-ideas/big-idea-3-1/\">is made up of</a> what <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/yeimy-rivera\">solar physicists</a> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/tatiananiembro/\">like us</a> <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/sam-badman\">call</a> plasma. </p>\n\n<p>Normal gases, like the air you breathe on Earth, are made up of atoms bouncing around. <a href=\"https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation/atomic-structure\">Atoms consist of</a> a positively charged bundle of particles called the nucleus and negatively charged particles called electrons. The nucleus and the electrons are tightly stuck together so that atoms are overall neutral – that is, they have no charge. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engage.aps.org/dpp/resources/what-is-plasma\">A gas becomes a plasma</a> when the atoms it’s made of become so hot that their negatively charged electrons split apart from their positively charged nuclei. Now that the charged particles are separated from each other, the plasma can conduct electricity, and magnetic fields may pull the plasma or push it away.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8cSQltH6TU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Plasma is made up of charged particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Solar wind blows out of the Sun all the time</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the Moon lines up with Sun, blocking it from view and turning the sky dark. This phenomenon is called a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/\">total solar eclipse</a>. During an eclipse, you can see faint, wispy structures surrounding the Moon that extend across the sky. In that moment, what you are seeing is the Sun’s atmosphere: <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-corona/en/\">the corona</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The corona can reach millions of degrees, which is much hotter than the Sun’s surface. In fact, the corona is so hot that the particles shoot out of the Sun, escaping from the Sun’s gravity, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/\">engulfing the entire solar system</a>. This stream of plasma is called the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/what-is-the-solar-wind/\">solar wind</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The solar wind’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/2-solar-probes-are-helping-researchers-understand-what-phenomenon-powers-the-solar-wind-235286\">invisible, continuous gust of plasma</a> fills a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/heliosphere/\">bubble in space</a> that extends far beyond the orbit of Pluto. It can reach up to 2 million miles per hour (3 million kilometers per hour) – at that speed, the solar wind would take less than a minute to circle the Earth. For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station takes 90 minutes</a> to go around the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s hard to see the solar wind directly in photos once it leaves the corona, we can measure the gas directly with instruments in space. Scientists have recently gotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c80TzqNoqMg\">up close and personal</a> with it by sending missions such as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/\">Parker Solar Probe</a> closer to the Sun than ever before. The Parker Solar Probe flies directly into the solar wind and measures the gas directly just as it escapes the Sun – like a weather station. </p>\n\n<p>The Parker Solar Probe also has a <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/250716-parker-closest-sun-images\">specialized camera</a> that points sideways to see the Sun’s light as it scatters off the solar wind. Light scattering is the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-sky-blue-246393\">same process</a> that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUIlhKhzDA\">makes the sky blue</a> on Earth.    </p>\n\n<h2>Big solar explosions</h2>\n\n<p>The solar wind <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a014800/a014892/14892_009_PSP_EarthSunHelioPause_1080.mp4\">surrounds and engulfs the Earth</a> and other planets all the time, but most of the time it is safely guided around us by our planet’s magnetic field. However, occasionally the Sun also generates huge explosions that release big clouds of plasma into our solar system, some of which are directed toward Earth. These massive events are called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3NAdOYp8Q\">coronal mass ejections</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kSx7AOwEco?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA spacecraft track solar storms from their eruptions on the Sun until their impact on Earth.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Compared to the solar wind, which is always blowing, coronal mass ejections are short-lived but extreme. You can think of them as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/solar-storm-knocks-out-farmers-high-tech-tractors-an-electrical-engineer-explains-how-a-larger-storm-could-take-down-the-power-grid-and-the-internet-177982\">solar storms</a>. Solar storms also involve one important force that doesn’t really play a role in the weather on Earth: magnetism. </p>\n\n<p>The Sun is like a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">giant magnet</a>. All magnets create what we call magnetic field lines, which are lines along which charged particles such as plasma have an easy time traveling. The Sun’s magnetic field lines can be very twisted, and the solar wind and coronal mass ejections deform and drag them outward from the Sun. </p>\n\n<p>When these solar storms reach Earth, their coiled magnetic fields can sometimes interact with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/earths-magnetic-field-protects-life-on-earth-from-radiation-but-it-can-move-and-the-magnetic-poles-can-even-flip-216231\">our planet’s own magnetic field</a> and cause disturbances called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-nqOJU55s\">space weather</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Space weather is caused by the Sun</h2>\n\n<p>The Earth has a magnetic field and a protective bubble: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4FSg-90XlA&amp;t=3s\">the magnetosphere</a>. The magnetosphere shields us from the Sun’s solar wind and solar storms, acting like a force field to keep living things safe from the energetic particles released by the Sun. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TnFXddv37E?wmode=transparent&amp;start=19\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Magnetic reconnection happens when the magnetic field from a coronal mass ejection interacts with Earth’s magnetic field.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Most of the time this protective bubble works so well that you can’t tell that there is anything special happening out in space. During particularly big storms, however, some solar wind plasma can make it down into the Earth’s atmosphere. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLq6plMjU0\">coronal mass ejections pass</a> over Earth, their magnetic field <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TnFXddv37E&amp;t=19s\">can interact with Earth’s magnetic field</a>. The Sun and Earth’s magnetic field lines untangle and rearrange, and for a short while these fields can link together and let the Sun’s plasma in.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens, it can cause big <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJfy8acFaOg&amp;t=120s\">magnetic storms</a> all over the world. This interaction between ejections from the Sun and the Earth is what scientists refer to as space weather. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Green lines of light crossing the night sky, above a snow-covered landscape.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Space weather causes beautiful light shows near the North and South Poles on Earth.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=aurora%20borealis&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Rene Rossignaud, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Space weather is just like the weather on Earth, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colliding-plasma-ejections-from-the-sun-generate-huge-geomagnetic-storms-studying-them-will-help-scientists-monitor-future-space-weather-248384\">generated by its atmosphere</a>.

It reemerged in August 2025 when two pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/mn-pharmacists-say-were-punished-after-refusing-dispense-gender-transition-drugs\">sued Walgreens and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy</a>, saying they had been punished after refusing to dispense gender-affirming care medications that go against their religious beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>According to the pharmacists, Walgreens refused their requests for a formal religious accommodation, citing state law. One pharmacist had her hours reduced; the other was let go. If Minnesota law does not allow such an accommodation, <a href=\"https://www.umlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pharmacy-Filed-Complaint.pdf\">their lawsuit argues</a>, it violates religious freedom rights.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eEr0Q90AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a sociologist of law and medicine</a>, I’ve spent the past 20 years studying how pharmacists grapple with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/book.126995\">tensions between their personal beliefs</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.11.041\">and employers’ demands</a>. Framing the problem as a tension between religious freedom and patients’ rights is only one approach. Debates about pharmacists’ discretion over what they dispense also raise bigger questions about professional rights – and responsibilities. </p>\n\n<h2>Duty to dispense?</h2>\n\n<p>The most famous controversy, perhaps, dealt with contraception. In the early 2000s, some pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2005/12/03/5038222/pharmacists-suspended-over-prescription-oath\">refused to dispense Plan B</a>, also known as “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emergency-contraception-is-often-confused-with-abortion-pills-heres-how-plan-b-and-other-generic-versions-work-to-prevent-pregnancy-191310\">emergency contraception</a>” or the “morning-after pill.” Their refusal stemmed from a belief that it caused an abortion. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/health/morning-after-pills-abortion-fda.html\">That is inaccurate</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/plan-b-one-step-15-mg-levonorgestrel-information\">medical authorities</a>. When Plan B first became available in 1999, the label said the medication might work by expelling an egg that had already been fertilized. In 2022, the Food and Drug Administration relabeled Plan B to say that it acts before fertilization. From a medical perspective, both mechanisms are contraception, not abortion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pair of tweezers holds a white pill, photographed in front of a box that says 'PlanB One Step.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693480/original/file-20250929-56-u3iaga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Plan B’s early labeling contributed to confusion over how it works.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-photo-illustration-a-planb-one-step-contraceptive-news-photo/1406069799?adppopup=true\">Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>States responded to pharmacists’ refusals by adopting “<a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/pharmacy-refusals-101/\">responsibility laws</a>.” Some states <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17813/maiq.18.4.d0645433x5272652\">adopted “conscience clauses</a>” that <a href=\"https://www.kait8.com/story/5410417/conscience-clause-protects-arkansas-pharmacists-who-wont-dispense-plan-b/\">permitted pharmacists not to fill the prescription</a>. Others opted for “<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-45/section-45-14-67-1/\">duty to dispense</a>” laws that required pharmacists or pharmacies to provide the medication, or “<a href=\"https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PharmacyRefusalPolicies-June2010.pdf\">refuse and refer</a>” laws obligating objecting pharmacists to hand the prescription off to a colleague.</p>\n\n<p>This fight largely broke down across political lines. Groups that oppose abortion rights <a href=\"https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(05)02103-7/fulltext\">argued that pharmacists should have the right to opt out</a>, while groups in favor of abortion rights argued that <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resource/pharmacy-refusals-101/\">pharmacists should be required to dispense</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As this fight escalated, the conflict became about more than contraception or abortion. It revealed Americans’ views about what kinds of professionals pharmacists should be, and whether they are professionals at all – that is, members of <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo5965590.html\">occupational groups that have specialized knowledge and skills</a>, and exclusive rights to do particular kinds of work.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, for example, the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice American – now called Reproductive Freedom for All – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888411400700\">released an ad</a> with a man and a woman in bed, their feet hanging out of the sheets. Stuck between them was someone else wearing heavy black shoes. “Who invited the pharmacist?” the ad asked. </p>\n\n<p>Pro-choice organizations insisted that pharmacists had no right to question a doctor’s prescription. “A pharmacist’s job is to dispense medication, <a href=\"https://mobilization.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/maiq/18/4/article-p429.xml\">not moral judgment</a>,” said the president of Planned Parenthood Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>Some pharmacists felt that such messages did not just criticize “moral gatekeeping” but also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888411400700\">undermined their claims to professional authority</a>. Pharmacists undergo six years of training to earn a doctorate and are health care’s medication specialists. The idea that pharmacists were simply technicians, hired to fill whatever a prescription said, made them seem like physicians’ underlings.</p>\n\n<h2>Keeping patients safe</h2>\n\n<p>A short time later, when the opioid overdose crisis <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html\">began to escalate</a>, pharmacists again found themselves pulled in two directions. This time, the question was whether they should be <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691224770/policing-patients?srsltid=AfmBOorna0XO3X_o0LtTBYZ74TSkVxDtBT1iIX3yAot2vPCcn2J1RpoV\">both medical and legal gatekeepers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When the U.S. first tried to crack down on unauthorized opioid use, many pharmacists felt ambivalent about tasks like identifying people who were misusing or selling medications. One pharmacist told me, “Although I’m in the business of patient safety, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/lsi.12092\">I’m not in the police business</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Later, pharmacists began to see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231209445\">policing tasks as health care tasks</a>. They reasoned that policing patients helped keep patients safe, and they embraced enforcement as a key component of their work.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to 2021. America was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6935a4\">some doctors were prescribing</a> <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-hydroxychloroquine-and-chloroquine-dont-block-coronavirus-infection-of-human-lung-cells-143234\">hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin</a> to treat sick patients, though the FDA had not approved the medications for that purpose. Many pharmacists <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Blogs/CEO-Blog/court-addressed-how-and-why-a-pharmacist-may-legally-decline-to-honor-a-prescription\">refused to fill those prescriptions</a>, citing lack of scientific evidence and potential harm.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A box with an image of a horse's silhouette, running in front of an orange-and-yellow sunset.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693478/original/file-20250929-64-7mhmal.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, some physicians wrote off-label prescriptions for ivermectin – a drug used to kill worms and other parasites, intended for use in horses.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IvermectinWisconsinLawsuit/449ece27701548549eb3d57aef93cf3f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Ted S.

Liberals tended to oppose the bills, portraying pharmacists as skilled professionals whose expertise is essential to prevent harm. Conservative supporters claimed that pharmacists <a href=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/10/16/court-order-sought-requiring-pharmacies-to-fill-controversial-covid-19-prescriptions/\">should dispense whatever the doctor writes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional power</h2>\n\n<p>Each of these controversies has focused on a specific legal, ethical or medical issue. By extension, though, they are also about what kinds of professional discretion pharmacists should be able to exercise. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to medication, doctors prescribe, nurses administer and pharmacists dispense. Before the 20th century, pharmacists diagnosed disease and also compounded drugs. That changed when physicians <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/paul-starr/the-social-transformation-of-american-medicine/9780465093038/?lens=basic-books\">placed themselves at the top of the medical hierarchy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to professional autonomy, states regulate health care, but they permit health care professions to regulate themselves: to educate, license and discipline their own workers through professional boards. In exchange, <a href=\"https://nabp.pharmacy/about/boards-of-pharmacy/\">these boards</a> must do so “<a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/in-the-public-interest/9780813554266/\">in the public interest</a>” – prioritizing public health, safety and welfare over professionals’ own interests. </p>\n\n<p>Health care professionals, including pharmacists, must also follow ethical codes. The day they receive their iconic white coats, <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/About/Oath-of-a-Pharmacist\">pharmacists vow</a> to “consider the welfare of humanity and relief of suffering [their] primary concerns.” Pharmacists also commit to “respecting the <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Code-of-Ethics\">autonomy and dignity of each patient</a>,” which means that pharmacists partner with patients to make choices about their health. </p>\n\n<p>Self-regulation has legally given pharmacists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.11.041\">the right to act as “medical gatekeepers</a>” – to use their professional expertise to keep patients safe. <a href=\"https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/pharmacists-role-medication-safety\">This role is critical</a>, as patients whose lives have been saved by pharmacists catching errors can attest.</p>\n\n<p>It has not, however, given them the right to be “moral gatekeepers” who put their personal beliefs above the patient’s. Pharmacists control medications because of professional commitments, not personal beliefs. The <a href=\"https://www.pharmacist.com/Code-of-Ethics\">code of ethics</a> describes the pharmacist-patient relationship as a “covenant” that creates moral obligations for the pharmacist – including helping “individuals achieve optimum benefit from their medications,” being “committed to their welfare” and maintaining their trust. </p>\n\n<p>If pharmacists wish to regulate themselves, history makes clear they need to define what it means to act in the public interest and ensure that other pharmacists comply. If not, the state has proved more than willing to step in and do the job for them. They may not like the results.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264844/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Elizabeth Chiarello has received funding from the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

Those numbers are likely to be an underestimate, as there are no official surveys that track this information. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t have strong data on the high school graduation rates of college students who are not living in the U.S. legally. The best estimates suggest that about <a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NICOD2016_TOOLKIT-copy.pdf\">5% to 10% of all undocumented high schoolers go off to college</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Research shows that legal battles over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, have contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/news/enrollment-undocumented-students-california-universities-dropped-2016-2023\">drop in college enrollment</a>. DACA is a federal immigration policy that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/daca-trump-immigration-texas-doj-5b9990853b3f391e9cbca24706d4edb6\">allows some immigrants</a> who came to the U.S. as young children to receive temporary protection from deportation and to get work permits. </p>\n\n<p>College graduation rates are shaped by a number of factors, including the state an immigrant student lives in and whether they can receive in-state tuition and state-based financial aid. Other important factors are whether there are undocumented student resource centers and supportive mentors on campus. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How is attending college different for students without legal authorization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Undocumented high school students thinking about college may be unaware of their legal and financial options. Undocumented students frequently receive incorrect information about college options – and sometimes they do not want to disclose their <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/content/qt031649nf/qt031649nf.pdf\">immigration status to a school counselor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Where an undocumented student lives determines whether they can afford to pay for college, or in some cases whether they can attend at all. Undocumented students cannot receive any <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/help/fafsa\">federal student aid</a>, regardless of where they live, because you need to be an American citizen to receive this aid. Financial help is critical for many students, including immigrants, as most students receive some financial aid to <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/7_26_2023.asp\">pay for college</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are 22 states, as well as Washington, that allow undocumented students to <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">pay in-state tuition</a>. In addition, undocumented high schoolers are eligible for state-based financial aid in <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/basic-facts-instate/\">14 states</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, 10 states, like Wisconsin and Oklahoma, have enacted laws <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/states/#:%7E:text=State%20Policy%20Hub-,Portal%20to%20the%20States,all%20or%20some%20public%20colleges\">to block</a> undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can these students receive merit-based scholarships?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>That depends. Some scholarship programs require a lawful immigration status. Some scholarships might require students to be eligible for <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell\">Pell Grants</a>, meaning they also need lawful immigration status. Other programs, like public colleges in California and Washington state, have merit-based scholarships that undocumented students can apply for. Several national private scholarships are also available for undocumented students. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there some cases where these students simply cannot legally attend college?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are three states – <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/undocumented-daca-students/\">Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina</a> – where undocumented students cannot apply to most public universities. For these states, the board of regents <a href=\"https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/state/georgia/\">prohibits admission </a> for undocumented students. </p>\n\n<p>In Washington state, undocumented students who are residents can apply for state-based financial aid. Other states, like California, provide similar forms of aid. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are other practical questions prospective students need to consider?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, there’s the cost of going to college. Undocumented students are much more likely than citizens to be <a href=\"https://immigrationinitiative.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UNDERSTANDING-AND-SUPPORTING-UNDOCUMENTED-MIXED-STATUS-STUDENTS-IN-SCHOOLS_FINAL.pdf\">living in poverty</a>. And in general, <a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing/highlights\">college tuition is rising</a>. If you do not have access to resources, such as in-state tuition and state-based financial aid, the cost will likely be a prohibitive factor.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the question of what comes after college. Generally, without a lawful immigration status, undocumented students <a href=\"https://www.smc.edu/student-support/career-services/employment/documents/LifeAfterCollegeGuide.pdf\">struggle to find work</a>. Some states, like California and Washington, have enacted policies to remove barriers for <a href=\"https://www.kuow.org/stories/undocumented-washingtonians-can-now-work-as-doctors-and-teachers-under-new-law\">professional licenses</a>, letting undocumented immigrants still pursue different career paths. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How is Trump changing the education landscape for immigrant families?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/the-anti-immigrant-policies-in-trumps-final-big-beautiful-bill-explained/\">aggressive enforcement</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/us/trump-chicago-immigration-national-guard.html\">immigration policy</a> is prompting more undocumented students to consider whether they need to stay close to home, as many fear that they or their family members will be deported. </p>\n\n<p>Many undocumented students face <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12840\">significant family obligations</a> at home, as I find in my research. This can dissuade them from going far from home, or even from going to school at all.</p>\n\n<p>I know students who are now contemplating taking a year of absence, or dropping out altogether. I also know students who cannot concentrate on school work, because they are anxious about whether their loved ones will be detained. Many also have younger siblings and feel the pressure of stepping into a guardian role. </p>\n\n<p>Texas is an example of a place where undocumented students are particularly under stress. It was one of the first states to provide in-state tuition for undocumented students. In June 2025, the state <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/fight-over-in-state-tuition-undocumented-students/\">rescinded the policy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, undocumented college students in Texas need to pay out-of-state tuition costs, even if they have paid in-state so far. That roughly doubles the cost of annual tuition. Students and staff on the ground are scrambling to figure how to make sense of this abrupt policy shift. Similar rollbacks have happened <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/02/20/florida-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\">in Florida</a> and other states, and all of these measures are making it more challenging for undocumented students to consider pursing higher education.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266324/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Vanessa Delgado does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Indeed in 2024, 111 countries <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-myanmar-to-gaza-ukraine-to-sudan-2024-was-another-grim-year-according-to-our-mass-atrocity-index-246294\">experienced some form of mass atrocity</a> against civilians. </p>\n\n<p>While it is crucial to support these communities now through humanitarian aid and pressure on parties to end the violence, it is also important to continue the work once the fighting has ended by documenting the atrocities and elevating the voices of victims and survivors.

Don’t let marginalized voices be an afterthought</strong></p>\n\n<p>From my experience, post-atrocity fieldwork can too often rely on collections of firsthand accounts that include only, or for the most part, men. Women’s stories of intervening in mass violence tend to be largely absent. </p>\n\n<p>This reflects how post-atrocity research often overlooks the impact of gender norms and hierarchies. Depending on local cultures, women are often portrayed as victims by researchers, but men are frequently the voices of everyone’s experiences. </p>\n\n<p>Women have traditionally been excluded in post-atrocity research simply because no one asked them. Their experiences were dismissed as indistinct from men’s, shaped by patriarchal assumptions about heroism. There may also be reasons around the culture or stigma of surviving violence that silence women’s voices.</p>\n\n<p>Yet my interviews revealed women played vital roles — saving lives, resisting violence and halting militias. Ironically, it was often their political invisibility that enabled women’s acts of intervention.</p>\n\n<p>As such, a best practice approach to post-atrocity fieldwork would involve researchers actively including marginalized voices from the outset — particularly women, racial and ethnic minorities, and members of groups historically excluded — and use methods that uncover how power, identity and visibility shape who gets remembered.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://scholars.csus.edu/esploro/profile/nicole_fox/overview\">Nicole Fox</a>, associate professor of criminal justice, California State University, Sacramento</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Positionality is a method, not just a mindset</strong></p>\n\n<p>Navigating <a href=\"https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/\">positionality</a> – that is, a given individual’s place in society based on factors such as gender, class and race – in post-genocide research is both challenging and essential. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not just about self-reflection; it’s about shaping how and why you ask questions in places where trust has been shattered. </p>\n\n<p>Too often, researchers swoop in, collect stories and leave. But that does not truly capture the lived realities of people who have survived mass violence.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid this, it is important to build teams that include both insiders and outsiders. For example, we put together a team to conduct fieldwork that included a Rwandan genocide survivor, a South African scholar and an American scholar. We came from different regions, disciplines and life experiences. Crucially, our Rwandan colleague was a full research partner as well as acting as a translator. His presence granted access and trust we could never have earned alone.</p>\n\n<p>For researchers in sensitive contexts, building collaborative and thoughtful teams isn’t just ethical – it’s methodologically essential.</p>\n\n<p>This commitment to critical reflection and research design also plays out in how researchers from the Global South navigate predominantly Western academic spaces. </p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-wolfe-491b7786/\">Stephanie Wolfe</a>, professor of political science at Weber State University</em></p>\n\n<p>As an African researcher among mostly Western scholars, I found that I was perceived as African first and researcher second – which was a double-edged sword.</p>\n\n<p>It involved having to endure inquiries from colleagues that were often much more personal than professional, and having to prove sufficiently “Africanness” to white researchers.</p>\n\n<p>Such experiences made it hard to be taken seriously. As one of the few African-born scholars in the post-atrocity research space working in the U.S., it was important not to be an outsider. Positionality isn’t a footnote – it’s your lens and lived experience.</p>\n\n<p>As a field researcher, it is crucial to create spaces for more diverse scholars to be able to conduct research without being continually devalued or tested.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/kuraduse.cfm\">Claudine Kuradusenge-McLeod</a>, lecturer in  peace, human rights &amp; cultural relations at American University</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Secondary trauma is real and needs our attention</strong></p>\n\n<p>If trauma results from direct experience, secondary trauma occurs where people are exposed to or interact with those who have experienced trauma firsthand.</p>\n\n<p>Experiencing secondary trauma is an often-underappreciated dynamic of doing field research. Conducting interviews with survivors of violence can leave the researcher with images, sounds and vicarious connections to trauma. </p>\n\n<p>Post-atrocity researchers then have a real need to receive appropriate training, support and therapy. Breaking down the silent-burden element of this kind of work and creating spaces to talk and share this element of working with trauma in post-atrocity situations would better prepare researchers for the field.</p>\n\n<p>Creating lifelines, such as support networks, in the field and out, is essential to having the right support when it’s needed most. It is important that researchers also recognize that secondary trauma ties the practitioner to the field and our interviewees; this can be a resource for understanding violence and how it can be prevented. </p>\n\n<p>Universities can help researchers by providing resources to deal with secondary trauma. In addition, researchers themselves can find ways to talk about, share and process this kind of trauma.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/people/profile.html?id=cdavey\">Chris Davey</a>, lecturer in political science, Binghamton University</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Building trust is a process, not just an outcome</strong></p>\n\n<p>Attempting to create trust while conducting research in a post-genocidal society is challenging, yet vital. Knowing and respecting cultural, linguistic and historical norms are important ways for researchers to follow the principle of “do no harm.” </p>\n\n<p>In post-atrocity contexts, researchers have to contend with navigating complex sociopolitical dynamics to determine who they can trust, what organizations should be partnered with, and what is safe to do, ask or even publish. </p>\n\n<p>In some cases, researchers may also choose what not to do – such as stopping or declining an interview if it might put someone at risk. Practitioners are responsible for minimizing risk when working in communities that have experienced a complete breakdown of trusting relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing this dynamic can prepare researchers to preempt potential issues and manage unintended harm in a community that is already struggling to rebuild social trust.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, trust-building shouldn’t be seen as a means to an end, but as part of a process through which practitioners do no harm in the field and mitigate risk for partners who live in the research setting.</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.umb.edu/directory/samanthalakin/\">Samantha Lakin</a>, Senior Fellow, Center for Peace, Democracy, &amp; Development, UMass Boston</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Navigating bureaucracy and authoritarian spaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing how to safely navigate bureaucracy is crucial for keeping researchers and field-based teams safe in post-atrocity settings.</p>\n\n<p>Whether this means carrying documentation around, taking additional time to meet with authorities to get their approval for research, or being able to provide forms of compensation to officials, researchers need to be prepared. </p>\n\n<p>Taking this time might mean delaying engaging directly with survivors or other research participants, but it can often lead to insights about the local context, safety and the intersectionality of officials who might have unique takes on research themes.</p>\n\n<p>Working with local partners, like <a href=\"https://gecshceruki.org/en/\">GEC-SH</a> in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, to identify expectations in the field and learn from this existing expertise is key to successfully navigating bureaucracy – as is allocating additional time to cooperate with authorities and to understand the local context – including practices that might be characterized as “bribes.”</p>\n\n<p><em>– <a href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/people/profile.html?id=cdavey\">Chris Davey</a>, lecturer in political science, Binghamton University</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258245/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher P.

And then came <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">President Donald Trump’s peace plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 3, 2025, Hamas said that it <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hamas-agreed-to-parts-of-gaza-peace-proposal-trump-israel/\">accepted some aspects of the 20-point proposal</a>, including handing over administration of the Gaza Strip to a body of independent Palestinian technocrats and releasing all remaining Israeli hostages.</p>\n\n<p>Those hostages are the last of the 252 taken during <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/17/october-7-crimes-against-humanity-war-crimes-hamas-led-groups\">the Oct. 7, 2023, attack</a> – an event that two years on looks to represent a high point, so to speak, of Hamas’ power. As an <a href=\"https://mena.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/visiting-affiliated-faculty/mkhaimar-abusada.html\">expert on Palestinian political attitudes</a>, I believe the group now has few options to survive.</p>\n\n<p>Like former resistance groups in past peace processes, it could renounce arms and transform itself into a purely political party. But to do so, it needs to overcome a series of hurdles: confronting other parts of Trump’s plan, its unpopularity at home and its rigid ideology being the three most prominent. </p>\n\n<h2>Campaign of assassination</h2>\n\n<p>It is worth taking stock of just how degraded Hamas has become as the result of two years of onslaught by Israel’s vastly superior military.</p>\n\n<p>According to many intelligence reports, Hamas has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-11/israel-qatar-doha-strike-impact-unclear-as-hamas-still-in-gaza/105759734\">lost most of its senior command</a> in the Al-Qassam Brigades, its military wing. <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjz2wbcqeg\">Izz al-Din al-Haddad</a>, its current commander, survives, having presumably taken over from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-confirms-death-its-military-leader-mohammed-sinwar-2025-08-30/\">Mohammed Sinwar</a> – the brother of Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of Oct. 7 attack – who was killed in May 2025. But he presides over a dwindling army.</p>\n\n<p>Trump may not have been exaggerating when he indicated on Truth Social on Oct. 3 that Hamas had <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-puts-hamas-on-notice-deadline-accept-gaza-peace-deal\">lost 25,000 fighters</a>. Estimates regarding the group’s losses vary, but it <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47828\">could represent more than half</a> of the fighting force it had at the beginning of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-has-added-up-15000-fighters-since-start-war-us-figures-show-2025-01-24/\">recruiting new fighters</a> during that time. But many of these new recruits lack the competence and the experience of the dead ones. And the only motivations the new recruits have are hate and anger toward Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ political leadership has also been decimated. Chief political leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk\">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-67868754\">Saleh al-Arouri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67473719\">Yahya Sinwar</a>, have all been killed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"people walk on street past large billboard depicting slain anti-Israel leaders\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694437/original/file-20251004-56-g0tqis.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Iranians walk past a billboard of the slain leaders of anti-Israeli groups, including former Hamas political chief Yahya Sinwar.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/iranian-people-commute-past-a-massive-billboard-of-the-news-photo/2212286968?adppopup=true\">Mohammadali Najib/Middle East Images via AFP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>And it could have been worse.

But the operation missed its primary targets there.</p>\n\n<h2>Falling support in Gaza</h2>\n\n<p>Palestinian public pressure on Hamas has risen as the miseries of war have mounted. </p>\n\n<p>According to local health officials, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/after-false-dawns-gazans-hope-trump-will-force-end-two-year-old-war-2025-10-04/\">more than 67,000</a> have been killed and more than 169,000 have been injured. Most of the Gaza Strip has been reduced to rubble, and more than <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/trauma-repeated-displacement-gaza\">90% of the population has been displaced multiple times</a> – with most residents now living in tents. International organizations have reported famine and starvation in some parts of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has lost its power and influence over many areas now under Israeli control. Israeli military and intelligence have encouraged some members of the local Palestinian clans and militia to offer services in militia-controlled areas.</p>\n\n<p>In such areas, Hamas fighters have often <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/weakened-hamas-faces-rebel-clans-doubts-over-tehrans-backing-after-israel-iran-war/\">clashed with other Palestinian groups</a>, resulting in many deaths and growing resentment toward Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hamas-led-authorities-execute-alleged-collaborators-gaza-official-says-2025-09-22/\">execution and torture of Palestinians</a> suspected of collaboration with Israel has only worsened the situation, leading to chaos and lawlessness in many parts of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>It is little wonder, then, that half of Palestinians in Gazan <a href=\"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/997\">in the latest poll of attitudes</a> – taken in May 2025 – say they supported anti-Hamas demonstrations. Indeed, support for the group in both Gaza and the West Bank has continued to decline as the war has progressed.</p>\n\n<h2>The push for peace</h2>\n\n<p>The ongoing war and the inhumane daily conditions that local Palestinians in Gaza are dealing with have led to exhaustion and fatigue among the public.</p>\n\n<p>On social media, many Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/world/middleeast/palestinian-voices-hamas-cease-fire.html\">are asking Hamas publicly to endorse</a> the Trump plan and put an end to their misery. </p>\n\n<p>In deciding whether to accept all the plan’s 20 points, Hamas will, from its perspective, have to weigh whether agreeing to a very bad outcome is better than the alternative. Trump has warned that a failure to get on board will <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/03/trump-gives-hamas-sunday-6p-m-deadline-to-accept-his-peace-plan-00592887\">cause Hamas to face “all hell</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has already agreed to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq7zp7002o\">release the remaining Israeli hostages</a> and to relinquish power in Gaza to a technocratic Palestinian committee. If endorsed in full, this would put an end to the war and see the gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and no expulsion of the Palestinians out of Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have been facilitating Hamas’ response to the plan. And there is huge regional and international pressure to get the deal over the line.</p>\n\n<p>However, it would force Hamas to disarm itself and allow the entry of an international and regional force into Gaza to oversee the destruction of military infrastructure, including tunnels, weapons manufacturing and the remaining rockets – points of the latest plan that Hamas <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce35nx49reko\">appears more unwilling to accept</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What happens to the remaining Hamas fighters is a sticking point that might lead to the collapse of the whole plan. </p>\n\n<p>And any rejection of the plan that can be blamed on Hamas will no doubt be welcomed by members of the Israeli extreme right. Hard-line factions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition have an alternative plan: to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/what-do-israelis-military-think-of-netanyahus-plan-to-occupy\">fully occupy Gaza</a>, expel the Palestinians and reestablish Israeli settlements in Gaza.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men in suits stand with thumbs up gestures\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694435/original/file-20251004-56-mgyf81.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled the peace plan at the White House on Sept. 29, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-greets-israeli-prime-minister-news-photo/2238074428?adppopup=true\">Win McNamee/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Where next for Hamas?</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most viable option for Hamas is to transform itself into a political party. But to do so, the group will need to reform not only its structures but also its ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Political momentum is swinging back to a two-state solution. <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/international/article-868328\">France and Saudi Arabia</a> recently spearheaded a fresh push to that end at the United Nations, and a host of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk-france-and-other-western-nations-recognize-palestinian-state-ahead-of-un-meetings-but-symbolic-action-wont-make-statehood-happen-265534\">Western nations recognized Palestinian statehood</a> for the first time. Hamas may feel the pressure to finally accept a two-state solution, something it has <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240118-meshaal-hamas-rejects-two-state-solution/\">long resisted</a>. For its part, Trump’s plan only makes vague assertions noting the Palestinian “aspiration” for a state.</p>\n\n<p>If transforming into a purely political party is to be the fate of Hamas, it will need to play its cards shrewdly and swiftly. The Palestine Liberation Organization went through this process after its departure from Beirut in 1982, eventually putting politics and diplomacy over armed resistance. And Qatar, Turkey and Egypt can help Hamas moderate its stances, too. </p>\n\n<p>The rigid ideology of Hamas remains a hurdle. Since it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/what-is-the-group-hamas-a-simple-guide-tothe-palestinian-group\">formed in 1987</a>, Hamas has tethered itself to a hard-line Islamist ideology that does not allow fundamental compromises on issues such as recognition of Israel and the development of Palestine as a secular state.</p>\n\n<p>But there is the recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/07/world/middleeast/syria-shara-authoritarian-reform.html\">example of Syria</a> where, following the ouster of long-term dictator Bashar Assad, the main Islamist fighting group pivoted to politics – and was lauded in the international community for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Whether Hamas can succeed in such a transformation – should it even attempt to – remains to be seen. And there is one final snag: Even if Hamas does accept the latest peace proposal, other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza might not – and could attempt to sabotage the whole process.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266515/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mkhaimar Abusada is affiliated with, Member of the Board of Commissioners of the Independent Commission for Human Rights, Palestine</span></em></p>",

In 2013, for example, the government shut down due to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-government-general-news-9f568e68401b4695ad8290e89169d9c2\">disputes over the Affordable Care Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This time around, the ACA continues to play a central role, with Democrats demanding, among other things, an extension of subsidies for ACA plan insurance premiums that are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\">set to expire at the end of 2025</a>. Democrats are also holding out to roll back <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-government-shut-down-healthcare-funding-americans-medicaid-obamacare-2025-10\">cuts to the Medicaid program</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, as part of what he called his “One Big Beautiful Bill.” </p>\n\n<p>Without a budget agreement in place, Trump ordered  <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/M-25-35-Status-of-Agency-Operations.pdf\">most federal agencies</a> to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-2025-whats-still-open-00195598\">wind down their nonessential activities</a>. The shutdown will continue until Congress passes either a short-term or long-term funding bill and Trump signs it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/longest-government-shutdown-us-history-president-administration-rcna234766\">Government shutdowns are nothing new</a>, but as a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QY68LSIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">health policy expert</a>, I worry this time around the impasse may have far-reaching effects on health care. </p>\n\n<p>Even as Democrats stage their battle over access to health care, the shutdown itself could also make it harder for Americans to get the care they need. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to use the crisis to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03192-4\">permanently cut federal jobs on a mass scale</a>, including ones in the health care sector, which could substantially reshape federal health agencies and their ability to protect Americans’ health.</p>\n\n<h2>The partisan health care divide</h2>\n\n<p>Historically, questions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2882219\">how the government should support access to health care</a> have long been a source of conflict between the two main political parties. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psj.12385\">passage of the ACA in 2010 and its implementation</a> have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-12166741\">only intensified this friction</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the lead-up to the current shutdown, Republicans <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-vote-government-shutdown/\">needed Democratic votes in the Senate</a> to pass a bill that would <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/shutdown-near-certain-after-senate-again-rejects-funding-bills-00589136\">keep funding the government at existing levels at least until November</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In return for their support, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/shutdown-near-certain-after-senate-again-rejects-funding-bills-00589136\">sought several concessions</a>. A major one was to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">extend subsidies for ACA insurance policy premiums</a>, which were established during the COVID-19 pandemic. These subsidies addressed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00446.x\">shortcoming in the ACA</a> by decreasing premiums for millions of Americans – and they played a crucial role in <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/enrollment-growth-in-the-aca-marketplaces/\">more than doubling enrollment in the ACA marketplaces</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Without this extension, ACA premiums are set to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/how-much-more-would-people-pay-in-premiums-if-the-acas-enhanced-subsidies-expired/\">rise by more than 75% in 2026</a>, and the Congressional Budget Office estimated that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/how-will-the-2025-budget-reconciliation-affect-the-aca-medicaid-and-the-uninsured-rate/\">4.2 million Americans would lose insurance</a>. At least <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/why-might-republicans-consider-extending-obamacare-tax-credits/\">some Republicans seemed open to considering the ACA subsidies</a>, particularly those from districts that were more moderate and that had large <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/10/02/breaking-down-the-aca-subsidy-fight-00590901\">numbers of people enrolled in ACA plans</a>.

The other allowed people to receive services <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/30/hospital-at-home-program-winds-down-medicare-waiver-expires/\">at home that are generally provided in a hospital</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, most seniors will continue to receive Social Security payments. However, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/01/federal-government-shutdown-trump-congress-live-updates/86442840007/\">providers might be hesitant to schedule patients</a> covered by Medicare if the shutdown drags on over a long period of time. This is because <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-affects-medicare-medicaid/86435794007/\">payments to medical providers would likely be delayed</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What health services will continue to function?</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has indicated that there is <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-cms-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">enough funding for Medicaid</a>, the government program that primarily provides <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-10637708\">health services to low-income Americans</a>, to support the program through the end of the calendar year. If the shutdown lasts beyond that, states may have to decide whether to temporarily fund the program on their own or whether to reduce or delay provider payments. However, no previous shutdown has ever lasted <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/longest-government-shutdown-us-history-president-administration-rcna234766\">more than 34 days</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/117676\">Community health centers</a> are  generally expected to receive some funding, at least for now. These providers offer nonemergency medical services for <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/community-health-centers-provide-primary-care-to-nearly-34-million-patients\">about 34 million Americans each year</a>. Many also provide important <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13478\">services across the nation’s schools</a>. However, if <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/117676\">the standoff continues for more than a few days</a>, those centers may struggle to keep their doors open. </p>\n\n<p>Health and Human Services has also indicated that it will use all available funding to maintain “<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">minimal readiness for all hazards</a>” and will <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\">maintain certain medical services</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/\">Indian Health Service</a>. The Veterans Health Administration will also stay open. One of the agencies <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/07/fda-job-cuts-morale-low-staff-anxious-impact-of-new-leadership-makary-prasad-rfk-jr/\">most affected by previous layoffs</a>, the Food and Drug Administration, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/fda-chief-calls-agency-exempt-from-looming-government-shutdown\">has indicated that it would be exempt from further cuts</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A longer-term view</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the severity of the shutdown’s effects on health care will depend on how long it lasts.  </p>\n\n<p>It will also depend on whether Trump makes good on his stated intention to use the shutdown as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/trump-vought-shutdown-cuts.html\">an unprecedented opportunity” to reshape the federal bureaucracy</a>. The White House announced plans for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-government-shutdown-firings-layoffs-vought-1fd57313272ec4db5984f653b095be33\">potential mass firings of workers</a>, particularly those at “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115304455138824245\">Democrat Agencies</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether this threat is simply a bargaining tactic remains to be seen, and it’s unclear whether health-related workers and agencies are in the crosshairs. But given that previous layoffs <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/massive-cuts-to-health-and-human-services-workforce-signal-a-dramatic-shift-in-us-health-policy-253316\">specifically targeted health programs</a>, more permanent reductions in programs that affect health care may be on the way.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266565/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Simon F.

Joseph Larkin of the Philadelphia Police Department’s subway unit visited the Philadelphia High School for Girls to interview the school’s librarian, 61-year-old Miriam S. Axelrod. </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod had written a letter to Mayor James H.J. Tate about poor conditions on Philadelphia’s Broad Street Line subway. In her letter, she stated that the escalators in the subway concourse of the <a href=\"https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/collection/p15037coll3/id/65942/rec/52\">Walnut-Locust station</a> were out of operation for several weeks and requested that they “be put in running order.” </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod also asked that “something be done” about people using the subway stairs “as a latrine.” </p>\n\n<p>As a historian of <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479823987/hope-and-struggle-in-the-policed-city/\">post-1968 Philadelphia</a>, a proud alumna of Girls’ High and a rider of Philadelphia’s mass transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority – more commonly known as SEPTA – I was thrilled to find Axelrod’s story among 1960s administrative reports to the police commissioner in the <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">city archives</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Axelrod’s story reminds us that for nearly a century, Philadelphia’s mass transit has been plagued by poor conditions and unstable funding. Commuters’ complaints have <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181060788/\">often convinced government officials to act</a>. However, no effective plan has ever been implemented to definitively solve the city’s transit crises.</p>\n\n<h2>SEPTA’s current turmoil</h2>\n\n<p>On Sept. 15, 2025, SEPTA fully restored its service, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/septa-cuts-reversal-judge-lawsuit-20250904.html#loaded\">by court order</a>, after implementing 20% service reductions and a 21.5% fare increase due to a <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-septa-shapiro-funds-request/\">US$213 million budget deficit</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Service cuts began on Aug. 24, just one day before public school students returned to classrooms. This left <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SEPTA-Title-VI-Analysis_Final_250508_rev.pdf\">kids, seniors and people from nonwhite, working-class communities</a> with few alternative routes.

For weeks, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/newsletters/morning/septa-pennsylvania-public-transportation-trust-fund-bill-ban-ice-masks-20250815.html\">state legislators could not agree on how to fund SEPTA within the state budget</a>. City officials, transit executives and tourism experts advocated for a bailout because Pennsylvania will reap tax revenue when <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-city-council-septa-cuts-funding/\">Philly hosts millions of tourists</a> in 2026 for America’s 250th birthday, the FIFA World Cup and the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Gov. Josh Shapiro authorized the use of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s capital funds <a href=\"https://www.pa.gov/governor/newsroom/2025-press-releases/shapiro-admin-approves-septa--394-million-capital-funding-mainta\">to finance SEPTA’s operations through June 2027</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Some lawmakers have argued that SEPTA is guilty of <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/inq2/pennsylvania-transit-agencies-state-funding-20250618.html\">mismanaging funds</a>, since the agency already received over $1 billion in state subsidies last year for operating assistance and asset improvement.</p>\n\n<h2>Public transport in the 1920s</h2>\n\n<p>As a longtime Philadelphian who lived in Center City, Miriam Axelrod was familiar with the strengths and shortcomings of public transportation. </p>\n\n<p>At the age of 4, her family emigrated from Russia to Carmel, New Jersey. By 1920, they made Philadelphia their home just as <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2020/01/18/philadelphia-census-records/\">the city’s Russian community became the largest immigrant group</a> due to Jewish people escaping pogroms in Europe. Axelrod grew up living in South and North Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p>At that time, dozens of private transit companies operated in Philly.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Penn operated city buses. Red Arrow provided suburban trolley service. Pennsylvania and Reading railroads offered high-speed rail lines. The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. alone brokered deals with <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181240112/\">64 underlying companies</a> to annually rent their services under 999-year leases. Fiscal responsibility for quality transportation was complicated and often dependent on public funding. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">During PRT’s early years</a>, it paid the city $15,000 annually for snow removal. In return, the city spent $2 million for street paving and bridge repairs.  </p>\n\n<p>By 1922, the PRT and the city had built and unified two elevated train routes – with assistance from the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/philadelphiasrap00arnorich/philadelphiasrap00arnorich/page/n7/mode/2up?view=theater\">Union Traction Co. and the Market Street Elevated Passenger Railway Co.</a> – to create the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080328134244/http://www.septa.org/inside/history/mfse.html\">Market-Frankford Elevated Train Line</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A page from a high school yearbook with photos of three young women\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=760&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693466/original/file-20250929-66-51nq3v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=955&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Classmates at William Penn remembered Miriam Axelrod’s ‘remarkable capacity for starting arguments.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/\">Ancestry.com, U.S. School Yearbooks, 1900-2016</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>That was the same year Axelrod graduated from William Penn High School for Girls.

PRT later went to court to request a <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182144311/\">consolidation plan</a>. To make matters worse, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182143764/\">PRT had spent approximately $230 million from 1902 through 1939</a>, but that didn’t include spending to modernize old transit equipment. </p>\n\n<p>On Jan. 1, 1940, the <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181240622/\">Philadelphia Transportation Co.</a>, a private company with a 21-member board of directors that included five city representatives including the mayor, Robert E. Lamberton, merged the transit companies and took over PRT’s operations. <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501702402/running-the-rails/#bookTabs=1\">PTC became responsible</a> for 10,000 employees and providing transportation for 2 million passengers a day.</p>\n\n<p>PTC also acquired <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182143764/\">extensive financial responsibilities</a>. Payroll expenses cost $327,000 each week. The annual rate for leasing the subway and El was roughly $3 million. PTC had to provide its 25,000 bondholders an annual income of at least $959,207 while also fulfilling its promise to offer modern transit vehicles.</p>\n\n<h2>Overcrowding and frequent fare increases</h2>\n\n<p>During the 1940s through the 1960s, Axelrod took public transportation to her job as a librarian at Central High School and later Frankford High School. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, PTC made good on its promise to provide better transit service. In its first eight years of operation, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181285344/\">PTC spent $22.8 million</a> to purchase 1,506 new streetcars, buses and trackless trolleys while also improving terminal and plant facilities. The company even purchased advertisements in The Philadelphia Inquirer to highlight its achievements. PTC extended 38 existing routes and created 18 new routes that serviced old residential and industrial areas, along with newly developed neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>By 1949, however, many of PTC’s 3.2 million daily riders <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181285244/\">were complaining</a> about overcrowded subways, the end of free exchanges between popular routes and frequent fare increases. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black and white photo of men and women, some reading newspapers, in a subway car\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=454&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692947/original/file-20250925-56-7rsa5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Passengers ride a subway car in Philadelphia on Feb. 15, 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Subway/ce8c9f79259843c3a038d9e4cbe967ad/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Both PTC and the city faced scrutiny for these issues, although each party had distinct transit obligations outlined in their joint contract. PTC had to provide “safe and adequate service” that included spending on maintenance and replacement of transit equipment. The city was responsible for police and fire services on mass transit along with auditing PTC’s records. Both parties had to agree on fare changes under the state Public Utility Commission’s supervision. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, when issues on mass transit occurred, the city could persuade PTC to improve conditions, but the city was only required to offer emergency services to commuters. </p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-records/city-archives/\">Larkin personally addressed Axelrod’s 1967 complaint</a> about the subway, he informed her that the United Elevator Co. was repairing the escalators. He also assured her that the subway unit arrested 45 to 50 intoxicated people each month because they were at risk of falling onto the subway tracks. In “isolated cases,” Larkin explained, police arrested people for public urination and defecation. </p>\n\n<p>Larkin reassured Axelrod that PTC could keep subway conditions clean and under control. In reality, PTC was underwater in responsibilities and debt. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 30, 1968, SEPTA, a state agency formed five years earlier, took over PTC and managed transportation for the city and its surrounding areas. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190809161808/http://www.septa.org/media/50th/pictures/1968%20septa%20article%20B%26W.jpg\">SEPTA bought PTC for approximately $47.9 million</a>, settling the company’s debt, accepting its pension liability and <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/182139333/\">buying out the institution’s roughly 1.7 million shareholders</a>. Now federal and state funding rather than fare revenue largely determined the quality of the city’s public transit.</p>\n\n<h2>Decades of unpredictable funding</h2>\n\n<p>Since the 1960s, annual government funding to SEPTA has been unpredictable. <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9780807871904/philadelphia-divided/\">White flight</a>, <a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reshaping-ethnic-and-racial-relations-in-philadelphia\">deindustrialization</a> and job flight have <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/philadelphia300y00weig/page/704/mode/2up?q=wolf\">contributed to depopulation</a>, a declining tax base and <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479823987/hope-and-struggle-in-the-policed-city/\">government defunding of social programs</a> in Philadelphia. These socioeconomic shifts continue to affect Philadelphia’s budget for education, public housing and recreation as well as <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/news/septa-board-approves-fiscal-year-2025-operating-capital-budgets-safe-clean-secure/\">SEPTA’s $2.743 billion budget</a> as a public transit agency.</p>\n\n<p>Five counties in Greater Philadelphia contribute subsidies to SEPTA in exchange for transit service. Philadelphia alone <a href=\"https://seventy.org/uploads/attachments/clmt8ss9401fk4wnpfzbicd6q-how-philly-works-101.pdf\">contributes $110 million</a>. State subsidies also help <a href=\"https://wwww.septa.org/wp-content/uploads/page/planning/FY-2025-Budget-Book-Amendment-Full.pdf\">finance SEPTA’s</a> $1.74 billion operating budget, while federal subsidies support SEPTA’s $1 billion capital budget to pay for major repairs and new equipment. State politicians annually vote on funding for SEPTA, but there has not been a concrete solution to the funding crisis.</p>\n\n<p>For years, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181233736/\">politicians have proposed using county sales and gas taxes</a> along with business licensing fees to fund mass transit, without success. Additionally, since 2008 <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/infographics-who-drives-in-philadelphia-and-who-doesn-t/\">rising rates of car ownership</a> have also led to fewer commuters and reduced fare revenues for SEPTA. </p>\n\n<p>However, Philadelphians never ceased to demand better transit service. During the 1980s, the Pennsylvania Public Interest Coalition established <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/181465714/\">the Transit Riders Action Campaign</a>, also known as TRAC, which advocated that SEPTA have better safety, funding, accountability, service and stable fares. The Transport Workers Union Local 234 advised TRAC, while several organizations partnered with them: the Action Alliance of Senior Citizens, the Clean Air Council, Disabled in Action and the Delaware Valley Interfaith Coalition. </p>\n\n<p>Even today, local groups such as <a href=\"https://savethetrain.org/\">Save the Train</a> with outspoken commuters – like Axelrod was in her day – have launched campaigns to halt service cutbacks and encourage residents to write and telephone legislators who can vote to fund SEPTA. Residents have consistently united to advocate for quality mass transit. All that remains is an agreement among lawmakers to make it possible.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264860/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Menika Dirkson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

While pushing for nearly three hours, I developed an infection in my uterus called <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12309-chorioamnionitis\">chorioamnionitis</a>, which occurs when bacteria infect the uterus, placenta and sometimes the baby’s bloodstream. I had a fever, and my baby’s heart rate was significantly elevated. </p>\n\n<p>I remember feeling delirious; my colleague and friend, while delivering my baby, said she had never seen me in such a state. I couldn’t focus on pushing. I felt faint, and I worried about my baby. </p>\n\n<p>And I remember the incredible relief that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, brought me when it lowered my fever and decreased my and my baby’s heart rate. After taking it, I was able to push with confidence and welcome my healthy daughter, who is now 7 and thriving. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/tami-rowen\">practicing obstetrician and medical researcher</a> with nearly two decades of experience taking care of pregnant patients, I have to make a dozen decisions about acetaminophen use on any given day when I am working in the hospital. I have examined the data as a researcher, clinician and educator. Central to our jobs is balancing the risks and benefits of any treatments. </p>\n\n<p>The president’s words will not change how I practice, but I worry they will sow confusion in my patients and create fear of potential lawsuits for all practicing health care providers.</p>\n\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the leading organization that guides medical decisions on pregnancy and childbirth, has reiterated the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy\">safety and efficacy of acetaminophen use during pregnancy</a> in light of the confusion surrounding Trump’s claims.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixed messages</h2>\n\n<p>I first looked into the data on the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tylenol-could-be-risky-for-pregnant-women-a-new-review-of-25-years-of-research-finds-acetaminophen-may-contribute-to-adhd-and-other-developmental-disorders-in-children-168820\">possible links between acetaminophen and developmental disorders</a> a few years ago when I received a call from a woman who had recently learned she was pregnant and had caught the flu from her toddler child. She was concerned that Tylenol was dangerous for her developing baby. </p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7\">studies do suggest links</a> between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\">acetaminophen use in pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders</a> such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. But they lack a crucial distinction.  </p>\n\n<p>For one, they cannot pin down whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy itself was associated with the neurodevelopmental conditions in the child, or whether the fevers and other symptoms that led people to use the painkiller were playing a role in the outcome. Secondly, because those studies are based on statistical associations rather than controlled experiments, they <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-parents-need-to-know-about-tylenol-autism-and-the-difference-between-finding-a-link-and-finding-a-cause-in-scientific-research-265946\">cannot show cause and effect</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Since it is both unethical and nonfeasible to perform a controlled study evaluating the actual risks of acetaminophen use, the best proxy to control for environmental or genetic factors is to look at maternal exposure to acetaminophen and outcomes of more than one child in individual families. </p>\n\n<p>That’s exactly what was done in a 2024 Swedish study that analyzed nearly 2.5 million children born from 1995 to 2019 in Sweden to mothers who had documented use of any medication during pregnancy. When looking at individual children, the researchers found up to a 5% increase in autism for those exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. However, when siblings were included in the analysis – controlling for environmental, medical and genetic factors that could have contributed – the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.3172\">small, elevated risk disappeared</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A young boy and older girl stand together smiling in front of a house.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693998/original/file-20251001-56-w6duy4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 2024 Swedish study found that when siblings were taken into account, the association between acetaminophen use and autism became insignificant.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-brother-and-sister-in-front-of-urban-royalty-free-image/1461191254?phrase=siblings&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">MoMo Productions/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fever during pregnancy is dangerous for mother and baby</h2>\n\n<p>There are many important reasons why doctors like me may recommend acetaminophen to a pregnant patient. One pregnant patient I treated who had the flu was so sick that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sepsis-still-kills-1-in-5-people-worldwide-two-icu-physicians-offer-a-new-approach-to-stopping-it-175650\">she was septic</a>, meaning an infection had spread throughout her body. Her 103-degree fever and dangerously low blood pressure threatened her and her fetus’s life. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I did not hesitate to treat her with acetaminophen. Our goal was to bring down not only her body temperature but also the fetus’s heart rate, since a high heart rate can place dangerous stress on the fetus.

Pregnant people suffer from kidney stones, appendicitis or dental cavities that require root canal, just like people who are not pregnant. Up to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-06151-x\">70% of pregnant people experience back pain</a>, which can leave them unable to perform normal daily activities and care for their children.

The anxiety and fear that people bring to my office and to the delivery room about the many uncertainties associated with pregnancy and childbirth is palpable and legitimate. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why it is critical that all recommendations are sound and evidence-based, with a clear understanding of the nuances and limitations of research studies. I know every time I look at my children I think of everything I can do to keep them safe, and I wonder what I could have done in the past to prevent any problems we currently face. We owe it to parents like me and all future parents to give them the most honest and scientific information possible.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265947/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tami S.

In 1922, <a href=\"https://muninn.net/thoughts/edison-predictions/\">Thomas Edison declared</a> that in the near future, all school textbooks would be replaced by film strips, because text was 2% efficient, but film was 100% efficient. Those bogus statistics are a good reminder that people can be brilliant technologists, while also being inept education reformers. </p>\n\n<p>I think of Edison whenever I hear technologists insisting that educators have to adopt artificial intelligence as rapidly as possible to get ahead of the transformation that’s about to wash over schools and society. </p>\n\n<p>At MIT, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ihnlfqIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">I study</a> <a href=\"https://tsl.mit.edu/books/failure-to-disrupt/\">the history and future of education technology</a>, and I have never encountered an example of a school system – a country, state or municipality – that rapidly adopted a new digital technology and saw durable benefits for their students. The first districts to encourage students to bring mobile phones to class did not better prepare youth for the future than schools that took a more cautious approach. There is no evidence that the first countries to connect their classrooms to the internet stand apart in economic growth, educational attainment or citizen well-being.</p>\n\n<p>New education technologies are only as powerful as the communities that guide their use. Opening a new browser tab is easy; creating the conditions for good learning is hard. </p>\n\n<p>It takes years for educators to develop new practices and norms, for students to adopt new routines, and for families to identify new support mechanisms in order for a novel invention to reliably improve learning. But as AI spreads through schools, both historical analysis and new research conducted with K-12 teachers and students offer some guidance on navigating uncertainties and minimizing harm.</p>\n\n<h2>We’ve been wrong and overconfident before</h2>\n\n<p>I started teaching high school history students to search the web in 2003. At the time, experts in library and information science developed a pedagogy for web evaluation that encouraged students to closely read websites looking for markers of credibility: citations, proper formatting, and an “about” page. We gave students checklists like <a href=\"https://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=loexquarterly\">the CRAAP test</a> – currency, reliability, authority, accuracy and purpose – to guide their evaluation. We taught students to avoid Wikipedia and to trust websites with .org or .edu domains over .com domains. It all seemed reasonable and evidence-informed at the time. </p>\n\n<p>The first peer-reviewed article demonstrating effective methods for teaching students <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1177/016146811912101102\">how to search the web was published in 2019</a>. It showed that novices who used these commonly taught techniques performed miserably in tests evaluating their ability to sort truth from fiction on the web. It also showed that experts in online information evaluation used a completely different approach: quickly leaving a page to see how other sources characterize it. That method, now called <a href=\"https://libguides.cmich.edu/web_research/lateral\">lateral reading</a>, resulted in faster, more accurate searching. The work was a gut punch for an old teacher like me. We’d spent nearly two decades teaching millions of students demonstrably ineffective ways of searching.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, there is a cottage industry of consultants, keynoters and “thought leaders” traveling the country purporting to train educators on how to use AI in schools. National and international organizations publish AI literacy frameworks claiming to know what skills students need for their future. Technologists invent apps that encourage teachers and students to use generative AI as tutors, as lesson planners, as writing editors, or as conversation partners. These approaches have about as much evidential support today as the CRAAP test did when it was invented. </p>\n\n<p>There is a better approach than making overconfident guesses: rigorously testing new practices and strategies and only widely advocating for the ones that have robust evidence of effectiveness. As with web literacy, that evidence will take a decade or more to emerge. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s a difference this time. AI is what I have called an “<a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/x6vn7_v1\">arrival technology</a>.” AI is not invited into schools through a process of adoption, like buying a desktop computer or smartboard – it crashes the party and then starts rearranging the furniture. That means schools have to do something. Teachers feel this urgently. Yet they also need support: Over the past two years, my team has interviewed nearly <a href=\"https://www.teachlabpodcast.com/\">100 educators from across the U.S.</a>, and one widespread refrain is “don’t make us go it alone.” </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"uF1Wc\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uF1Wc/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>3 strategies for prudent path forward</h2>\n\n<p>While waiting for better answers from the education science community, which will take years, teachers will have to be scientists themselves. I recommend three guideposts for moving forward with AI under conditions of uncertainty: humility, experimentation and assessment.</p>\n\n<p>First, regularly remind students and teachers that anything schools try – literacy frameworks, teaching practices, new assessments – <a href=\"https://tsl.mit.edu/ai-guidebook/\">is a best guess</a>. In four years, students might hear that what they were first taught about using AI has since proved to be quite wrong. We all need to be ready to revise our thinking.   </p>\n\n<p>Second, schools need to examine their students and curriculum, and decide what kinds of experiments they’d like to conduct with AI. Some parts of your curriculum might invite playfulness and bold new efforts, while others deserve more caution. </p>\n\n<p>In our podcast “The Homework Machine,” <a href=\"https://www.teachlabpodcast.com/the-homework-machine-ep-6-inviting-ai-to-the-party/\">we interviewed Eric Timmons</a>, a teacher in Santa Ana, California, who teaches elective filmmaking courses. His students’ final assessments are complex movies that require multiple technical and artistic skills to produce. An AI enthusiast, Timmons uses AI to develop his curriculum, and he encourages students to use AI tools to solve filmmaking problems, from scripting to technical design. He’s not worried about AI doing everything for students: As he says, “My students love to make movies. … So why would they replace that with AI?”</p>\n\n<p>It’s among the best, most thoughtful examples of an “all in” approach that I’ve encountered. I also can’t imagine recommending a similar approach for a course like ninth grade English, where the pivotal introduction to secondary school writing probably should be treated with more cautious approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Third, when teachers do launch new experiments, they should recognize that local assessment will happen much faster than rigorous science. Every time schools launch a new AI policy or teaching practice, educators should collect a pile of related student work that was developed before AI was used during teaching. If you let students use AI tools for formative feedback on science labs, grab a pile of circa-2022 lab reports. Then, collect the new lab reports. Review whether the post-AI lab reports <a href=\"https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.154x+3T2018/courseware/68505eb307434be7bb9db38cf6390153/f026ebd78d074718b2cbf0d18474fb45/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B11.154x%2B3T2018%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40f026ebd78d074718b2cbf0d18474fb45\">show an improvement on the outcomes you care about</a>, and revise practices accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>Between local educators and the international community of education scientists, people will learn a lot by 2035 about AI in schools. We might find that AI is like the web, a place with some risks but ultimately so full of important, useful resources that we continue to invite it into schools. Or we might find that AI is like cellphones, and the negative effects on <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4735240\">well-being and learning</a> ultimately outweigh the potential gains, and thus are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.5xc5dxfwu\">best treated with more aggressive restrictions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone in education feels an urgency to resolve the uncertainty around generative AI. But we don’t need a race to generate answers first – we need a race to be right.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265172/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Justin Reich has received funding from Google, Microsoft, Apple, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Chan/Zuckerberg Initiative, the Hewlett Foundation, education publishers, and other organizations that are involved in technology and schools. </span></em></p>",

The fossil evidence Darwin collected over his five-year journey eventually helped him to think about an <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin\">infinite variety of species</a>, both past and present.</p>\n\n<p>The HMS Beagle and its crew traversed these places while testing clocks and drawing maps for the Royal Navy, and the voyage was <a href=\"https://undsci.berkeley.edu/who-pays-for-science/\">funded by the British government</a>. Darwin’s position as a naturalist aboard the ship was unpaid, but, fortunately, his family’s private assets were enough to cover his living expenses while he focused on his scientific work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, government and private funding both remain important for scientific discoveries and translating knowledge into practical applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dE_Q4twAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">As a professor of science education</a>, one of my goals while preparing future teachers is to introduce them to the <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13165/chapter/7#78\">characteristics of scientific knowledge</a> and how it is developed. For decades, there has been a strong consensus in my field that educated citizens also <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/resources/science-all-americans\">need to know</a> about the nature of the scientific enterprise. This includes understanding who pays for science, which can differ depending on the type of research, and why it matters. </p>\n\n<p>Funding for science is more than just the amount of money. To a large extent, the organizations that fund research set the agenda, and different funders have different priorities. It can also be hard to see the downstream benefits of scientific research, but they typically outweigh the upfront costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic research leads to new knowledge</h2>\n\n<p>Basic research, also called fundamental research, involves systematic study aimed at acquiring new knowledge. Scientists often pursue research that falls into this category without specific applications or commercial objectives in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it costs money to follow where curiosity leads; <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-does-it-cost-to-run-a-lab\">scientists need funding</a> to pursue questions about the natural and material world. </p>\n\n<p>About 40% of basic research in the U.S. has been federally funded in recent years. The <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24332\">government makes this investment</a> because basic research is the foundation of long-term innovation, economic growth and societal well-being.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"7CZW2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7CZW2/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Funding for basic research is distributed by the federal government through several agencies and institutes. For more than a century, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/organization/history\">National Institutes of Health have sponsored</a> a breadth of scientific and health research and education programs. Since 1950, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/history\">National Science Foundation has advanced</a> basic research and education programs, including the training of the next generation of scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Other federal agencies have complementary missions, such as the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, created in response to the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957. DARPA focuses on technological innovations for national security, many of which have become fixtures of civilian life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/lifecycle-of-a-research-grant-behind-the-scenes-of-the-system-that-funds-science-255163\">Through a competitive review process</a> at these agencies, subject experts vet research proposals and make funding recommendations. The amount of funding available from the NIH, NSF and DARPA varies annually, depending on <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/process\">congressional appropriations</a>. Most of the awarded funds go to universities, research institutions and other health and science organizations that conduct research. The sum of research dollars awarded <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/federal-health-science-funding-states-map\">differs among states</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Applying research</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists undertake basic research to generate new knowledge with no specific end goal in mind. Applied research is different in that it aims to find solutions to real-world problems.</p>\n\n<p>Research that investigates specific, practical objectives or improvements with commercial potential is more likely to attract private investors. Companies directly invest in research and development to gain a competitive edge and turn a profit. Private industry is more likely to sink dollars into applied rather than basic research because the potential payoff in the form of a new product or advance is more visible. </p>\n\n<h2>From discovery to real-world implementation</h2>\n\n<p>As applied research addresses problems, promising findings are moved toward clinical application or mainstream use. This research and development process can lead to tangible benefits for individuals and society.</p>\n\n<p>Federal agencies such as the NIH make substantial investments in the basic and applied science underlying new drugs. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies heavily <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25353#\">invest in the development of drug candidates</a>. Recent reports have shown that <a href=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/phrma/fact-sheets/clinical-trials/TEConomy_PhRMA-_Biopharma-Industry-Sponsored-Clinical-Trials.2025-Report.Final_.pdf\">industry has been responsible for 50%</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ResearchAmerica-Investment-Report.Final_.January-2022-1.pdf\">or more</a> of the dollars invested in health and biomedical research in recent years. This expenditure includes significant <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.1921\">spending to advance clinical trials</a> – the studies that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-clinical-trial-a-health-policy-expert-explains-137221\">test new medical treatments</a> before they get approved for use. </p>\n\n<p>The NIH funded basic research that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1715368115\">contributed to every single drug approved</a> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2016. This includes key work that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/get-smart/vaccines\">led to COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign likely <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations\">saved the U.S. more than $1 trillion</a> in health care expenses that would have otherwise been incurred and also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223\">saved lives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Initial NSF investments in research was instrumental in <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/astronomy-space/black-holes\">capturing images of black holes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/oceans\">exploring deep oceans</a>. Basic research funded by NSF paved the way for everyday conveniences such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/science-matters/pocket-sized-progress-smartphones-nsf-innovations\">smartphones</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/origins-google\">Google search engine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/ai\">artificial intelligence</a>. Other funded projects led to quality of life improvements such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/asl\">American Sign Language</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/kidney-exchanges\">kidney matching</a> for transplants. <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/beyond-the-classroom\">Educational programming</a>, such as “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and “The Magic School Bus,” were NSF-backed projects, too. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CLOMZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CLOMZ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>It matters who pays: Funding shapes science</h2>\n\n<p>Funders and financial systems shape the trajectory of research across fields.

What happens to these particles within atoms would stay unexplained without this tool. The calculations using virtual particles predict the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles with such uncanny accuracy that some scientists think “they must really exist.”</p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are not real – it says so right in their name – but if you want to understand how real particles interact with each other, they are unavoidable. They are essential tools to describe three of the forces found in nature: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-electromagnetic-force\">electromagnetism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-strong-force\">the strong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-weak-force\">weak nuclear</a> forces. </p>\n\n<p>Real particles are lumps of energy that can be “seen” or detected by appropriate instruments; this feature is what makes them observable, or real. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are a sophisticated mathematical tool and cannot be seen. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Feynman\">Physicist Richard Feynman</a> invented them to describe the interactions between real particles.</p>\n\n<p>But many physicists are not convinced by this cut-and-dried distinction. \nAlthough researchers can’t detect these virtual particles, as tools of calculation they <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2022-06-quantum-electrodynamics-accurately.html\">predict many subtle effects</a> that ultrasensitive experiments have confirmed to a mind-boggling 12 decimal places. That precision is like measuring the distance between the North and South poles to better than the width of a single hair.</p>\n\n<p>This level of agreement between measurements and calculations makes virtual particles the most thoroughly vetted idea in science. It forces some physicists to ask: Can a mathematical tool become real?</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayQhNLqbTFk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles help scientists follow the interactions between particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A bookkeeping tool</h2>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are the tool that physicists use to calculate how forces work in the microscopic subatomic world. The forces are real because they can be measured.</p>\n\n<p>But instead of trying to calculate the forces directly, physicists use a bookkeeping system where short-lived virtual particles carry the force. Not only do virtual particles make the calculations more manageable, they also resolve a long-standing problem in physics: How does a force act across empty space? </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles exploit the <a href=\"https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/uncertainty-principle\">natural fuzziness of the subatomic world</a>, where if these ephemeral particles live briefly enough, they can also briefly <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2014-07-boosting-space.html\">borrow their energy from empty space</a>. The haziness of the energy balance <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834383-000-why-virtual-particles-dont-exist-but-do-explain-reality-for-now/\">hides this brief imbalance</a>, which allows the virtual particles to influence the real world. </p>\n\n<p>One big advantage of this tool is that the mathematical operations describing the forces between particles can be visualized as diagrams. They tend to look like stick-figure cartoons of particle pingpong played with virtual particles. The diagrams – dubbed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe7atm1x6Mg\">Feynman diagrams</a> – offer an excellent intuitive framework, but they also give virtual particles an aura of reality that is deceiving. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe7atm1x6Mg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Feynman diagrams help physicists calculate particle interactions.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Amazingly, this virtual particle-based method for calculation produces some of the most precise predictions in all of science. </p>\n\n<h2>Reality check</h2>\n\n<p>All matter is made of basic building blocks called atoms. Atoms, in turn, are made of small <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">positively charged particles called protons</a> found at their core, surrounded by even smaller <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainselectrons\">negatively charged particles called electrons</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a professor of <a href=\"https://dd285.physics.msstate.edu\">physics and astronomy at Mississippi State University</a>, I perform experiments that often rely on the idea that the electrons and protons seen in our instruments interact by swapping virtual particles. My colleagues and I have recently measured the <a href=\"https://www.jlab.org/new-measurement-fits-another-piece-proton-radius-puzzle\">size of the proton</a> very precisely, by bombarding hydrogen atoms with a beam of electrons. This measurement assumes that the electrons can “feel” the proton at the center of the hydrogen atom by exchanging virtual photons: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsphotons\">particles of electromagnetic energy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Physicists use virtual particles to calculate how two electrons repel each other, with exquisite precision. The forces involved are represented as the accumulated effect of the two electrons trading virtual photons.</p>\n\n<p>When two metal plates are placed extremely close together in a vacuum, they attract each other: This is known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.4656\">Casimir effect</a>. Physicists can accurately calculate the force that pulls the plates together using virtual particle mathematics. Whether the virtual particles are really there or not, the math predicts exactly what researchers observe in the real world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of two black circles merging in space\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles can help explain how black holes act.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://mediaassets.caltech.edu/gwave\">SXS</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet another mysterious prediction made using the virtual particle tool kit is so-called <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/hawking-radiation\">Hawking radiation</a>. When virtual particle pairs pop into existence at the edge of black holes, sometimes the black hole’s gravity grabs one partner while the other escapes. This rift causes the black hole to slowly evaporate. Although Hawking radiation has not yet been directly observed, researchers have recently <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/hawkings-black-hole-theorem-confirm-0701\">observed it indirectly</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Useful fiction</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s circle back to the question: Can a mathematical tool become real? If you can perfectly predict everything about a force by imagining it is carried by virtual particles, do these particles qualify as real? Does their fictional status matter? </p>\n\n<p>Physicists remain divided on these questions. Some prefer to “just shut up and calculate” – one of Feynman’s famous quips. For now, virtual particles are our best way to describe how particles behave. But researchers are developing <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/\">alternative methods</a> that do not need them at all. </p>\n\n<p>If successful, these approaches could make virtual particles vanish for good. Successful or not, the fact that alternatives exist at all suggests virtual particles might be useful fiction rather than physical truth. It also fits the pattern of previous revolutions in science – the example of ether comes to mind. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/ether-theoretical-substance\">Physicists invented ether</a> as a medium through which light waves traveled. Experiments matched well with calculations using this tool, yet they could not actually detect it. Eventually, Einstein’s theory of relativity showed it was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are a striking paradox of modern physics. They shouldn’t exist, yet they are indispensable for calculating everything from the strength of magnets to the behavior of black holes. They represent a profound dilemma: Sometimes the best insights into reality come through carefully constructed illusion. In the end, confusion around virtual particles may be just the price of understanding fundamental forces.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264739/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dipangkar Dutta receives funding from US Dept. of Energy and NSF. </span></em></p>",

The contents spill onto the table, bench and floor. It’s a chaotic – but functional – solution to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Children have a penchant for unconventional thinking that, at first glance, can look disordered. This kind of apparently chaotic behavior served as the inspiration for developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a>’s best-known theory: that children construct their knowledge through experience and must pass through <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/2672709\">four sequential stages</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/X7rU9Wvm94M\">first two of which</a> lack the ability to use structured logic.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget remains the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.004\">GOAT of developmental psychology</a>. He fundamentally and forever changed the world’s view of children by showing that kids do not enter the world with the same conceptual building blocks as adults, but must construct them through experience. No one before or since has amassed such a <a href=\"https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Jean+Piaget%22\">catalog of quirky child behaviors</a> that researchers even today can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00359.x\">replicate within individual children</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While Piaget was certainly correct in observing that children engage in a host of unusual behaviors, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXEkpesAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">my</a> <a href=\"https://www.kiddlab.com/\">lab</a> recently uncovered evidence that upends some long-standing assumptions about the limits of children’s logical capabilities that originated with his work. Our new paper in the journal Nature Human Behaviour describes how young children are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02302-6\">capable of finding systematic solutions</a> to complex problems without any instruction.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb4TPj1pxzQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jean Piaget describes how children of different ages tackle a sorting task, with varying success.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Putting things in order</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout the 1960s, Piaget observed that young children rely on <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">clunky trial-and-error methods</a> rather than systematic strategies when attempting to order objects according to some continuous quantitative dimension, like length. For instance, a 4-year-old child asked to organize sticks from shortest to longest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb4TPj1pxzQ\">will move them around randomly</a> and usually not achieve the desired final order. </p>\n\n<p>Psychologists have interpreted young children’s inefficient behavior in this kind of ordering task – what we call a seriation task – as an indicator that kids can’t use systematic strategies in problem-solving <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">until at least age 7</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, my colleagues and I found that increasing the difficulty and cognitive demands of the seriation task actually prompted young children to discover and use algorithmic solutions to solve it.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget’s classic study asked children to put some visible items like wooden sticks in order by height. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3BT7I0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Huiwen Alex Yang</a>, a psychology Ph.D. candidate who works on computational models of learning in my lab, cranked up the difficulty for our version of the task. With advice from our collaborator <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vOHeGXcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Bill Thompson</a>, Yang designed a computer game that required children to use feedback clues to infer the height order of items hidden behind a wall, . </p>\n\n<p>The game asked children to order bunnylike creatures from shortest to tallest by clicking on their sneakers to swap their places. The creatures only changed places if they were in the wrong order; otherwise they stayed put. Because they could only see the bunnies’ shoes and not their heights, children had to rely on logical inference rather than direct observation to solve the task. Yang tested 123 children between the ages of 4 and 10. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlsbcE6nOxk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Researcher Huiwen Alex Yang tests 8-year-old Miro on the bunny sorting task. The bunnies are hidden behind a wall with only their sneakers visible. Miro’s selections exemplify use of selection sort, a classic efficient sorting algorithm from computer science. <em>Kidd Lab at UC Berkeley.</em></span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Figuring out a strategy</h2>\n\n<p>We found that children independently discovered and applied at least two well-known sorting algorithms. These strategies – called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort\">selection sort</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort\">shaker sort</a> – are typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn0915\">studied in computer science</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More than half the children we tested demonstrated evidence of structured algorithmic thinking, and at ages as young as 4 years old. While older kids were more likely to use algorithmic strategies, our finding contrasts with Piaget’s belief that children were incapable of this kind of systematic strategizing before 7 years of age. He thought kids needed to reach what he called the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/concrete-operational-stage\">concrete operational</a> stage of development first.</p>\n\n<p>Our results suggest that children are actually capable of spontaneous logical strategy discovery much earlier when circumstances require it. In our task, a trial-and-error strategy could not work because the objects to be ordered were not directly observable; children could not rely on perceptual feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Explaining our results requires a more nuanced interpretation of Piaget’s original data. While children may still favor apparently less logical solutions to problems during the first two Piagetian stages, it’s not because they are incapable of doing otherwise if the situation requires it.</p>\n\n<h2>A systematic approach to life</h2>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is crucial not only in high-level math classes, but also in everyday life. Imagine that you need to bake two dozen cookies, but your go-to recipe yields only one. You could go through all the steps of making the recipe twice, washing the bowl in between, but you’d never do that because you know that would be inefficient. Instead, you’d double the ingredients and perform each step only once. Algorithmic thinking allows you to identify a systematic way of approaching the need for twice as many cookies that improves the efficiency of your baking.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is an important capacity that’s useful to children as they learn to move and operate in the world – and we now know they have access to these abilities far earlier than psychologists had believed. </p>\n\n<p>That children can engage with algorithmic thinking before formal instruction has important implications for STEM – science, technology, engineering and math –education. Caregivers and educators now need to reconsider when and how they give children the opportunity to tackle more abstract problems and concepts. Knowing that children’s minds are ready for structured problems as early as preschool means we can nurture these abilities earlier in support of stronger math and computational skills. </p>\n\n<p>And have some patience next time you encounter children interacting with the world in ways that are perhaps not super convenient. As you pick up your belongings from a café floor, remember that it’s all part of how children construct their knowledge. Those seemingly chaotic kids are on their way to more obviously logical behavior soon.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266438/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Celeste Kidd receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the Jacobs Foundation, and the Advanced Research and Invention Agency. </span></em></p>",

North and central Florida <a href=\"https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2024/on-the-history-science-wonderment-florida-springs.aspx\">comprise one of the largest concentrations</a> of freshwater springs in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these springs provide a home to a variety of wild animals and plants. But they are also canaries in the coal mine for Florida’s groundwater system, because they draw upon the same groundwater that many Floridians depend on for drinking water, farm irrigation and industrial use.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, many Florida springs suffer from <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/how-are-floridas-springs-threatened\">reduced flow and habitat loss, as well as excessive algae and heavy pressure from human use</a>. Because most of the state’s springs are not monitored by any research institution or government agency, the full scope of the problem remains unclear.</p>\n\n<p>The state Legislature has designated 30 <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/owper/water-policy/content/outstanding-florida-springs-ofs\">Outstanding Florida Springs</a> whose health must be protected under the <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0300-0399/0373/0373PARTVIIIContentsIndex.html\">Florida Springs and Aquifer Protection Act of 2016</a>. But <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/springs\">24 of the 30 were impaired</a> by pollution – primarily nitrogen – at the time of this designation, and today, their condition has not improved.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, 26 of the 30 – the same 24 springs, plus two more – <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3943/2025_Santa_Fe_River_BMAP_%281%29.pdf?1758919604\">have been found</a> <a href=\"https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/07/10/dep-once-again-fails-florida-springs-wont-push-polluters/#:%7E:text=Alarmed%20by%20the%20trend%2C%20in,now%20includes%20a%2025th%20spring.\">to be impaired</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3945/LithiaBuckhornSprings.pdf?1759333546\">According to</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3946/TBEP_10_00CrystalSprings.pdf?1759333573\">multiple reports</a> and my own observation, many other popular springs are impaired by pollution as well. Since 2011, the state of Florida <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/Springs%20Fact%20Sheet%201.pdf\">has spent roughly US$357 million</a> on springs restoration.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8IvzdbAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">geography professor</a>, I study springs in the context of people and their use of water. My research has taught me that Florida’s springs vary based on location and local circumstances. Because of this, I believe reviving their health will require several multidimensional solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>Recalling healthy springs</h2>\n\n<p>What should a healthy spring look like? The answer to this can be harder to articulate than you might think. Many springs feature a visible boil at the water surface above the spring vent, crystal clear water, submerged grasses waving in the current, and a range of fish, turtles, snails and other aquatic animals hiding in the grasses.</p>\n\n<p>Yet because many springs are changing slowly, changes in flow and water clarity can go unnoticed. Some scientists call this the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/shifting-baseline.htm\">shifting baseline syndrome</a>: Each generation perceives springs in a slightly more degraded state, but absent prior observations, we assume that what we see is “normal.”</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, in the case of Florida springs, historical observations from naturalists and area residents give scientists clues going back centuries.</p>\n\n<p>When Bartram visited <a href=\"https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ruth-b-kirby-gilchrist-blue-springs-state-park\">Manatee Springs</a> near Chiefland and the Suwannee River in the Big Bend in 1774, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/63678/63678-h/63678-h.htm#chap12\">he wrote that the spring’s flow was “astonishing</a>” and that “it is impossible to keep the boat or any other floating vessel over the fountain.” </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, senior citizens who grew up in north central Florida in the early 20th century <a href=\"https://dl.bookfunnel.com/ht74pjc4zf\">told writer P.C. Zick</a> that spring flow at <a href=\"https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ichetucknee-springs-state-park\">Ichetucknee Springs</a> was once so strong that they could hear the spring boil before getting close enough to see it.</p>\n\n<p>Both springs’ boils are noticeable today, but they are clearly not what they used to be.</p>\n\n<p>When naturalist <a href=\"https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/103785#page/1/mode/1up\">John James Audubon</a> visited <a href=\"https://floridasprings.org/outstanding-florida-springs-deleon-spring/\">Volusia County’s De Leon Springs</a> in 1832, he found that “The water was quite transparent, although of dark color.” And Bartram wrote of Salt Springs that the water was so clear, he thought he could reach out and touch fish that were 20 to 30 feet below the surface.</p>\n\n<p>Water clarity in thriving springs fosters plenty of submerged grasses soaking up sunshine, along with a wide variety and large number of fish and other aquatic animals that depend on this vegetation. <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/63678/63678-h/63678-h.htm#chap04\">Bartram wrote that he spotted</a> gar, trout, bream, “the barbed catfish, dreaded sting-ray, skate and flounder, spotted bass, sheeps head and ominous drum” at Salt Springs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a

Various springs suffer from one or more of these problems.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, as Florida’s population and tourism have grown, so have the number of visitors to the state’s most popular springs. In 2019, Florida springs <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2020/09/FRE_SpringsFactsheet.Print_.pdf\">attracted more than 4 million visitors</a>. During the summer, especially on weekends, some springs are so crowded that staff members have to turn away visitors. And in winter, springs that attract manatees can be equally crowded.</p>\n\n<p>In shallow portions of springs and <a href=\"https://www.sjrwmd.com/waterways/springs/characteristics/\">spring runs</a>, this means thousands of happy feet trample and destroy vegetation.

Algae naturally occurs in most springs, but today, many springs have so much that it <a href=\"https://sjrr.domains.unf.edu/2-5-turbidity/\">clouds the water</a>, or they have stringy <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/filamentous-algae\">filamentous algae</a> that blankets the soil and rocks around a spring and along its run. Still others have algae that sticks to submerged aquatic plants, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/untreated-sewage-and-fertilizer-runoff-threaten-the-florida-manatees-main-food-source-contributing-to-malnutrition-236461\">blocking vital sunlight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The predominant narrative among many springs scientists, advocates and government officials is that <a href=\"https://www.mysuwanneeriver.com/419/Nitrate-Concentration\">rising nitrate levels</a> in springs over the past few decades fuels the growth of excess algae. Nitrate, a form of nitrogen, is a plant nutrient.</p>\n\n<p>Yet other scientists have suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082571\">reduced spring discharge creates slower-moving water</a>, which loses its ability to push excess algae away. </p>\n\n<p>Another hypothesis is that if dissolved oxygen levels temporarily fall below a certain threshold, it can kill off the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12403\">snails and other animals that graze on the algae</a> and keep it in check.</p>\n\n<h2>A balanced restoration plan</h2>\n\n<p>More than two-thirds of state-funded springs restoration projects over the past decade have been for <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813079158\">some form of enhanced sewage treatment</a>. This is because excess nitrogen is assumed to be the cause of excess algae in Florida springs, and Florida farmers are presumed to be in compliance with water quality regulations <a href=\"https://www.fdacs.gov/Agriculture-Industry/Best-Management-Practices-BMPs/Agricultural-Water-Policy-FAQ\">if they implement best management practices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Enhanced sewage treatment is a good thing, especially in cases where human waste is clearly a pressing problem. In some cases, investing in advanced sewage treatment, shifting landowners from <a href=\"https://www.hernandosun.com/2022/09/03/septic-to-sewer-grants-and-msbu-funding-mechanism-approved/\">septic systems to sewage treatment plants</a> or even enhanced <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/three-sisters-springs-wetland-treatment-project\">treatment of storm water</a> before it sinks into the ground clearly benefits springs.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.hernandocounty.us/departments/departments-n-z/utilities/septic-to-sewer-project\">shifting people from septic tanks to central sewage treatment is expensive</a>. Based on the evidence and my own observations of various springs within Florida’s landscape, I believe that many springs need more than this single solution.</p>\n\n<p>Some need <a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/projects/springs/three-sisters-springs-canal-stabilization-project\">shoreline stabilization to prevent erosion</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hernandocounty.us/departments/departments-n-z/parks-and-recreation/waterways-aquatic-services/spring-protection-zone\">rules that reduce human pressure</a> on spring vegetation. Others need <a href=\"https://floridaspecifier.com/issues/v46n5/a-model-of-resilient-restoration-the-kings-bay-restoration-project/#:%7E:text=Remove%20Muck:%20Decades%20of%20accumulated,than%20500%2C000%20native%20eelgrass%20units\">algae or sediment removed</a> and native vegetation reintroduced.</p>\n\n<p>In still other cases, <a href=\"https://www.alachuaconservationtrust.org/act-acquires-santa-fe-springs\">it would help to purchase property to prevent harmful development or to retire farmland</a>. And in nearly every case, the springs would benefit from Florida residents and businesses <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/swamp-for-the-springs-take-action/\">reducing water and fertilizer use</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And, restoring and maintaining the health of Florida’s 1,100 springs will require further study to tailor appropriate interventions to each one.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263704/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher F.

Edgar Hoover had <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/church-committee.htm\">abused his power</a> to persecute people and organizations he <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-targeting-of-enemies-like-james-comey-echoes-fbis-dark-history-of-mass-surveillance-dirty-tricks-and-perversion-of-justice-under-j-edgar-hoover-265364\">viewed as political enemies</a> – destroyed what formerly had been near-automatic trust in the presidency and the FBI.</p>\n\n<p>In response, Congress enacted reforms designed to ensure that legal actions by the Department of Justice and the FBI, the department’s main investigative arm, would be insulated from politics. These included stronger congressional oversight, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/03/fbi-director-10-years-trump-wray/\">10-year term limit for FBI directors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation-9781440871603/\">investigative guidelines</a> issued by the attorney general. </p>\n\n<p>Some of these measures, however, were tenuous. For example, Justice Department leaders could alter FBI investigative guidelines at any time. </p>\n\n<p>Donald Trump’s first presidential term <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/comey-isnt-the-first-fbi-director-to-keep-memos-on-a-president-77899\">seriously tested</a> DOJ and FBI independence – notably, when Trump <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/j-edgar-hoovers-oversteps-why-fbi-directors-are-forbidden-from-getting-cozy-with-presidents-78896\">fired FBI Director James Comey</a> in May 2017. Trump claimed Comey <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527663050/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">mishandled a 2016 probe</a> into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s private email server, but Comey also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531927032/comey-trump-asked-for-loyalty-wanted-him-to-let-flynn-investigation-go\">refused to pledge loyalty</a> to the president.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in Trump’s second term, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/28/trump-executive-power-courts-00201120\">prior guardrails have vanished</a>. The president has installed loyalists at the DOJ and FBI who are dedicated to implementing his political interests.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uo7pnK3N3hU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A lawsuit filed by three former FBI officials fired by the Trump administration asserts that the bureau is being politicized and is supporting Trump’s agenda.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ek4r01QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">a historian of the FBI</a>, I recognize the FBI has had only one other overtly political director in the past 50 years: L. Patrick Gray, who served for a year under President Richard Nixon. Gray was held accountable after he tried to help Nixon end the FBI’s Watergate investigation. Whether Trump’s current director, Kash Patel, has more staying power is unclear.</p>\n\n<h2>After Hoover</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since Hoover’s death in 1972, presidents have typically nominated independent candidates with bipartisan support and <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors\">law enforcement roots</a> \nto run the FBI. Most nominees have been judges, senior prosecutors or former FBI or Justice Department officials. </p>\n\n<p>While Hoover publicly proclaimed his FBI independent of politics, he sometimes did the bidding of presidents, including Nixon. Still, Nixon felt that Hoover <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/us/tape-shows-nixon-feared-hoover.html\">had not been compliant enough</a>, so in 1972 he selected Gray, a longtime friend and assistant attorney general, to be Hoover’s successor. </p>\n\n<p>Gray took steps to move the bureau out of Hoover’s shadow. He relaxed strict dress codes for agents, recruited female agents and pointedly hired people from outside the agency – who were not indoctrinated in the Hoover culture  – for administrative posts.</p>\n\n<p>Gray asserted his authority with blunt force. FBI agents at field offices and at headquarters who resisted Gray’s power were censured, fired or transferred. Other senior officials <a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">opted to leave</a>, including the bureau’s top fraud expert, cryptanalyst and skyjacking expert, and the head of its Crime Information Center. </p>\n\n<p>Agents regarded these moves as a purge, and press reports claimed that bureau <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/03/archives/gray-reshuffles-9-on-f-bis-staff-8-had-long-service-in-the-crime.html\">morale was at an all-time low</a>, charges that Gray denied. According to <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9781586483777/G-Mans-Life-FBI-Being-Deep-1586483773/plp\">FBI Associate Director Mark Felt</a>, who became Gray’s second in command, 10 of 16 top FBI officials chose to retire, most of them <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/fbi/author/sanford-ungar/first-edition/\">notable Hoover men</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Gray surrounded himself with what journalist Jack Anderson called “<a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">sharp, but inexperienced, modish, young aides</a>.” FBI insiders called these new hires the “Mod Squad,” a reference to the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062589/\">counterculture TV police series</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit answers questions at a microphone.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693181/original/file-20250927-56-nyzsfo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Attorney L.

He was so rarely spotted at FBI headquarters that bureau insiders dubbed him “<a href=\"https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYSIP19721222-01.1.10&amp;e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA--------0------\">Two-Day Gray</a>.” At the request of Nixon aide John Ehrlichman, Gray told field offices to <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6875672/the-fbi-political-orders/\">help Nixon campaign surrogates</a> by providing local crime information.</p>\n\n<p>Gray cooperated with Nixon to stymie the FBI’s investigation of the 1972 Watergate break-in and the ensuing cover-up. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/06/archives/a-saddened-witness-louis-patrick-gray-3d-a-no-2-man-closer-to-inner.html\">provided raw FBI investigative documents</a> to the White House and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/27/archives/gray-says-he-destroyed-files-from-hunt-given-him-as-he-met-ehrlichn.html\">burned documents</a> from Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt’s White House safe. </p>\n\n<p>When Nixon had CIA Deputy Director <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/04/archives/a-dedicated-deputy-of-the-cia-enlisted-in-1941-hardworking-officer.html\">Vernon Walters</a> ask Gray, in the name of national security, to halt the FBI’s investigation, Felt and other agency insiders demanded that Gray get this order in writing. The White House backed down, but Nixon’s directive had been recorded. That tape became the so-called “<a href=\"https://millercenter.org/smoking-gun\">smoking gun</a>” evidence of a Watergate cover-up.</p>\n\n<p>Felt, in classic Hoover fashion, then leaked information to discredit Gray, <a href=\"https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700623426/\">hoping to replace him</a>. Gray resigned in disgrace. </p>\n\n<p>While Felt never got the top job, he is now remembered as the prized anonymous source “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/washington/19felt.html\">Deep Throat</a>,” who helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/washington-post\">Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate investigation</a>. But it was internal FBI resistance, from Felt and agents at lower levels, that led to Gray’s departure.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jSrc1CLuQA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">After Democratic National Committee headquarters at Washington, D.C.’s Watergate Hotel was  burgled in June 1972, the FBI was charged with investigating the break-in – as Director L. Patrick Gray tried to subvert his own agency’s investigation.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political from the start</h2>\n\n<p>Campaigning in 2024, Donald Trump vowed to “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-compares-political-opponents-vermin-root-alarming-historians/story?id=104847748\">root out</a>” his political opponents from government. Realizing he was a target because of his investigation of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, FBI director Christopher Wray, whom Trump had nominated in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/wray-trump-fbi-director.html\">resigned in December 2024</a> before Trump could fire him. </p>\n\n<p>In Wray’s place Trump nominated loyalist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kash-Patel\">Kash Patel</a>, a lawyer who worked as a low-level federal prosecutor from 2013 to 2016 and then as a deputy national security appointee during Trump’s first term. </p>\n\n<p>Patel publicly <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/kash-patel-tells-members-media-government-after-trumps/story?id=105432592\">supported Trump’s vow to purge enemies</a> and claimed the FBI was part of a “deep state” that was resistant to Trump. Patel <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/kash-patel-tells-members-media-government-after-trumps/story?id=105432592\">promised to help dismantle</a> this disloyal core and to “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ln145l3o\">rebuild public trust</a>” in the FBI.</p>\n\n<p>Even before Patel was confirmed on Feb. 20, 2025, in an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44842\">historically close</a> 51-49 vote, the Justice Department began <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-fbi-firings-immigration-crime-ad7d6b44\">transferring thousands of agents</a> away from national security matters to immigration duty, which was not a traditional FBI focus. </p>\n\n<p>Hours after taking office, Patel shifted 1,500 agents and staff from FBI headquarters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/fbi-agent-transfers-kash-patel-sworn-in/\">to field offices</a>, claiming that he was streamlining operations. </p>\n\n<p>Patel installed outsider <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/kash-patel-privately-agreed-hire-204724031.html\">Dan Bongino</a> as deputy director. Bongino, another Trump loyalist, was a former New York City policeman and Secret Service agent who had become a full-time political commentator. He embraced a conspiracy theory positing the FBI was “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5306990/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director\">irredeemably corrupt</a>” and advocated “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/dan-bongino-fbi.html\">an absolute housecleaning</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In February, New York City Special Agent in Charge James Dennehy told FBI staff “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/fbi-new-york-email-trump.html\">to dig in</a>” and oppose expected and unprecedented political intrusions. He was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-fbi-official-forced-criticizing-trump-pursuit-agents-investigated-rcna194610\">forced out</a> by March. </p>\n\n<p>Patel then used <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/fbi-polygraph-kash-patel.html\">lie-detector tests</a> and carried out a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/politics/kash-patel-fired-fbi-agents.html\">string of high-profile firings</a> of agents who had investigated either Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Some agents who were fired <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/27/nx-s1-5555373/fbi-agents-fired-2020-george-floyd-protest-knee\">had been photographed kneeling</a> during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington, D.C. – an action they said they took to defuse tensions with protesters.</p>\n\n<p>In response, three fired <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fired-fbi-officials-sue-patel-claiming-he-bowed-to-trumps-campaign-of-retribution\">agents are suing Patel</a> for what they call a political retribution campaign. Ex-NFL football player <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/former-bears-cb-charles-peanut-tillman-says-he-quit-fbi-due-to-trump-administrations-policies-230106635.html\">Charles Tillman</a>, who became an FBI agent in 2017, resigned in September 2025 in protest of Trump policies. Once again, there are <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/1fb5c976fb1f1bd2/ff631230-full.pdf\">assertions of a purge</a>.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1965856884419866735&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Will Patel be held accountable?</h2>\n\n<p>Patel’s actions as director so far illustrate that he is willing to use his position to implement the president’s political designs. When Gray tried to do this in the 1970s, accountability still held force, and Gray left office <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/washington/09gray.html\">in disgrace</a>. Gray participated in a cover-up of illegal behavior that became the subject of an impeachment proceeding. What Patel has done to date, at least what we know about, is not the equivalent – so far. </p>\n\n<p>Today, Patel’s tenure rests solely upon pleasing the president. If formal accountability – a key element of a democracy – is to survive, it will have to come from Congress, whose Republican majority has so far not exercised its power to hold Trump or his administration accountable. Short of that, perhaps internal resistance within the administration or pressure from the public and the media might serve the oversight function that Congress, over the past eight months, has abrogated.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265637/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Douglas M.

No doubt drawing optimism from <a href=\"https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1569&amp;context=lawreview\">having weathered severe crises</a> before, the Cuban government seems committed to a state of defiance.</p>\n\n<p>But the evidence this time around suggests Havana’s leaders should be less sanguine.</p>\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-partially-rolls-back-internet-rate-hike-anger-grows-2025-06-03/\">increasing costs</a>, Cubans enjoy widespread access to the internet and they <a href=\"https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-09-28-u1-e209363-s27061-nid311893-encuesta-cibercuba-abrumadora-mayoria-cubanos-desea#google_vignette\">know</a> just how bad and how inequitable things are. </p>\n\n<p>For all the government’s rhetoric and commitment to a decades-old revolution, Cubans see a much-vaunted <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/crisis-situation-cuba\">medical system that is failing</a>, unable to provide drugs, procedures — or even electricity.

And with the U.S. now pursuing a policy of maximum pressure against noncompliant governments in Latin America, Havana can rest assured that it will see little breathing room from its powerful neighbor and long-time antagonist.  </p>\n\n<p>That leaves the Cuban government with only a few options.</p>\n\n<p>It could choose to continue <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-06-03/cuban-government-dollarizes-the-internet-this-measure-is-true-digital-apartheid.html\">trying to restrict</a> its citizens’ access to the internet. Unfortunately for the state, the <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-06-03/cuban-government-dollarizes-the-internet-this-measure-is-true-digital-apartheid.html\">internet</a> is the lifeblood of the private sector. </p>\n\n<p>Cuba’s leaders could also choose to rely on the loyalty of its security forces and their ability to intimidate and abuse their fellow Cubans. That has <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cuba-crackdown-harsh-sentences-protesters-220844308.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall\">worked in the past</a>, but given Havana’s scarce resources and its limited capacity to reward its henchmen, it is not clear that the government can afford to adopt this approach indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, Cuba’s leaders could take steps toward further reform the private sector and eliminate the waste and corruption that have increasingly defined the Cuban state.</p>\n\n<p>Such a course would require the government to permit all Cubans, not just a well-connected few, to compete with state enterprises. It would also mean allowing for a greater degree of foreign investment, which <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121914/how-invest-cuba.asp\">has remained stunted</a> due to government policy. </p>\n\n<p>If the past offers any guide, however, Havana will instead continue to rely on its <a href=\"https://raceandequality.org/resources/cuba-warning-about-the-escalation-of-repression-against-activists-and-human-rights-defenders-four-years-after-the-11j-protests/\">formidable security</a> apparatus to repress is citizens, while privatizing in ways that do not threaten the power and privileges of the elite.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266203/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joseph J.

Let me explain how a prolonged shutdown could affect the economy – and why it could be a tipping point to recession.</p>\n\n<h2>Direct impacts from a government shutdown</h2>\n\n<p>The partial government shutdown <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/02/us/trump-government-shutdown\">began on Oct. 1, 2025</a>, as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a deal on funding some portion of the federal government. A partial shutdown means that some funding bills have been approved, entitlement spending continues since it does not rely on annual appropriations, and some workers are deemed necessary and stay on the job unpaid.</p>\n\n<p>While most of the 20 shutdowns that occurred from 1976 through 2024 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\">lasted only a few days</a> to a week, there are signs the current one <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-quick-compromise-to-the-first-government-shutdown-in-nearly-7-years-seems-unlikely-266450\">may not be resolved so quickly</a>. The economy would definitely take a direct hit to gross domestic product from a lengthy shutdown, but it’s the indirect impacts that could be more harmful. </p>\n\n<p>The most recent shutdown, which extended over the 2018-2019 winter holidays and lasted 35 days, was the longest in U.S. history. After it ended, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54937\">estimated the partial shutdown delayed</a> approximately US$18 billion in federal discretionary spending, which translated into an $11 billion reduction in real GDP. </p>\n\n<p>Most of that lost output was made up later once the shutdown ended, the CBO noted. It estimated that the permanent losses were about $3 billion – a drop in the bucket for the <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/gdp-update\">$30 trillion U.S. economy</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a man in a uniform locks a gate on a road into a park\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694177/original/file-20251002-74-rzepbj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many parks, such as Florida’s Everglades National Park, were closed as a result of the shutdown.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/APTOPIXGovernmentShutdown/ad3339c153c142eeb844c34ec97be763/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The indirect and more lasting impacts</h2>\n\n<p>The full impact may depend to a large extent on the psychology of the average consumer. </p>\n\n<p>Recent data suggests that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/us-consumer-confidence-falls-to-five-month-low-on-job-market\">consumer confidence is falling</a> as the stagnation in the labor market becomes more clear. Business confidence has been mixed as the <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence\">manufacturing index</a> continues to indicate the sector is in contraction, while <a href=\"https://www.economy.com/united-states/business-confidence/seasonally-adjusted\">other business confidence measures</a> indicate mixed expectations about the future.</p>\n\n<p>If the shutdown drags on, the psychological effects may lead to a larger loss of confidence among consumers and businesses. Given that consumer spending accounts for 70% of economic activity, a fall in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/understanding-consumer-confidence-index/#:%7E:text=7-,CCI%20Interpretation,action%20to%20stimulate%20the%20economy.\">consumer confidence</a> could signal a turning point in the economy.</p>\n\n<p>These indirect effects are in addition to the direct impact of lost income for federal workers and those that operate on federal contracts, which leads to reductions in consumption and production.  </p>\n\n<p>The risk of significant government layoffs, beyond the usual furloughs, could deepen the economic damage. Extensive layoffs would shift the losses from a temporary delay to a more permanent loss of income and human capital, reducing aggregate demand and potentially increasing unemployment spillovers into the private sector. </p>\n\n<p>In short, while shutdowns that end quickly tend to inflict modest, mostly recoverable losses, a protracted shutdown – especially one involving layoffs of a significant number of government workers – could inflict larger, lasting impacts on the economy.</p>\n\n<h2>US economy is already in distress</h2>\n\n<p>This is all occurring as the U.S. labor market is flashing warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Payrolls <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">grew by only 22,000</a> in August, with July and June estimates revised down by 21,000. This follows payroll growth of only 73,000 in July, with May and June estimates revised down by 258,000. \nIn addition, preliminary annual revisions to the employment data show the economy gained <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prebmk.nr0.htm\">911,000 fewer jobs</a> in the previous year than had been reported. </p>\n\n<p>Long-term unemployment is also rising, with 1.8 million people out of work for more than 27 weeks – nearly a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2025/number-of-long-term-unemployed-was-1-8-million-in-july-2025.htm\">total number of unemployed individuals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, AI adoption and cost-cutting could further reduce labor demand, while an aging workforce and lower immigration shrink labor supply. Fed Chair Jerome Powell refers to this as a “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250822a.htm\">curious kind of balance</a>” in the labor market.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the job market appears to have come to a screeching halt, making it difficult for recent graduates to find work. Recent graduate unemployment – that is, those who are 22 to 27 years old – is now <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693\">5.3% </a> relative to the total unemployment rate of 4.3%.</p>\n\n<p>The latest data from the <a href=\"https://mediacenter.adp.com/2025-10-01-ADP-National-Employment-Report-Private-Sector-Employment-Shed-32,000-Jobs-in-September-Annual-Pay-was-Up-4-5\">ADP employment report</a>, which measures only private company data, shows that the economy lost 32,000 jobs in September. That’s the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">biggest decline</a> in 2½ years. While that’s worrying, economists like me usually wait for the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers to come out to confirm the accuracy of the payroll processing firm’s report.</p>\n\n<p>The government data that was supposed to come out on Oct. 3 might have offered a possible counterpoint to the bad ADP news, but due to the shutdown BLS will not be releasing the report.</p>\n\n<h2>Problems Fed rate cuts can’t fix</h2>\n\n<p>This will only increase the uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. And it adds to the uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariffs as well as the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-sets-10-tariff-lumber-imports-higher-rates-wooden-products-2025-09-30/\">newly imposed tariffs</a> on lumber, furniture and other goods. </p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">Fed is expected to lower</a> interest rates at least two more times this year to stimulate consumer and business spending following its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fed-rate-cut-is-attempt-to-prevent-recession-without-sending-prices-soaring-265370\">September quarter-point cut</a>. This raises the risk of reigniting inflation, but the cooling labor market is a more immediate concern for the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>While lower short-term rates may help at the margin, I believe they cannot resolve the deeper challenges, such as massive government <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-treasury-statement/summary-of-receipts-outlays-and-the-deficit-surplus-of-the-u-s-government\">deficits</a> and <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/\">debt</a>, tight <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ongoing-inflation-concerns-reshaping-spending-135500814.html\">household budgets</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cbreim.com/insights/articles/digging-out-of-the-us-housing-affordability-crisis\">housing affordability crisis</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shrinking-labor-force-scariest-number-job-market-hiring-unemployment-2025-8\">shrinking labor force</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The question now is not will the Fed cut rates, because it likely will, but whether that cut will help, particularly if the shutdown lasts weeks or more. Monetary policy alone cannot overcome the uncertainty created by tariffs, the lack of fiscal restraint, companies focused on cutting costs by replacing people with technology, the impact of the shutdown and the fears of consumers about the future.</p>\n\n<p>Lower interest rates may buy time, but they won’t solve these structural problems facing the U.S. economy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266327/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John W.

Later cases include campaign finance and transgender sports.</p>\n\n<p>This year’s controversies focus on three dominant themes. One is the continuing constitutional revolution in how the justices read our basic law. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-seismic-change-has-taken-place-at-the-supreme-court-but-its-not-clear-if-the-shift-is-about-principle-or-party-190815\">court has shifted</a> from a living reading of the Constitution, which says the Constitution should adapt to the American people’s evolving values and the needs of contemporary society, to an <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/white-papers/on-originalism-in-constitutional-interpretation\">original reading</a>, which aims to enforce the constitutional principles understood by the Americans who ratified them.</p>\n\n<p>Another clear theme is the deep cultural division among Americans. The core disputes at the court this year reflect controversial factual questions about gender and race: How pervasive and influential is racism in the current day? Are gender transitions a recognized fact, which means that they must be accepted in sports competitions, or can a state assert that trans athletes are not women?</p>\n\n<p>A final theme is the struggle for partisan advantage embedded in several cases. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a

that the proper way to read the Constitution was as an <a href=\"https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/living-constitution\">evolving document</a>, an approach usually <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/white-papers/democratic-constitutionalism\">described as living constitutionalism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The new majority reads the Constitution as an expression of enduring principles, which <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/white-papers/on-originalism-in-constitutional-interpretation\">maintain their historical meaning</a> unless the American people collectively decide to amend the document, an approach known as originalism.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2022, this revolutionary shift has led to dramatic changes in the law on <a

legal scholars Gary Jeffrey Jacobsohn and Yaniv Roznai put it – turns to transgender politics. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/little-v-hecox/\">Little v. Hecox</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/west-virginia-v-b-p-j-2-2/\">West Virginia v. B.P.J.</a> ask whether a state can ban transgender athletes from participating in girls or women’s sports. The plaintiffs are middle school and university students who were banned by state laws from participating as a female competitor. They are asking the court to rule that transgender identity is a protected category similar to race and gender under the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xiv/clauses/702#the-equal-protection-clause\">equal protection clause</a> of the 14th Amendment.\n<div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-originalism-did-it-underpin-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-abortion-and-guns-debunking-the-myths-186440\">Originalists argue</a> that the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear and fixed. It establishes the equal status of racial minorities as holders of rights. But originalists do not believe the equal protection clause was meant to apply to sexual identities unless that is explicitly approved through a constitutional amendment by the American public.</p>\n\n<p>Originalists also emphasize the role of <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/intro.7-3/ALDE_00000032/\">federalism</a> as a core <a href=\"https://www.jackmillercenter.org/our-work/resources/tenth-amendment?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=18311871328\">constitutional principle</a>. Federalism allocates a great deal of <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/education/classroom-resource-library/classroom/6.6-info-brief-federalism\">authority to state legislatures</a> to make decisions when a question of rights is uncertain. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons the court majority is likely to see the regulation of who gets to participate in women’s sports as a state-by-state decision. </p>\n\n<h2>Cultural divisions, disputed perceptions</h2>\n\n<p>The status of transgender identity also reflects the disputed perceptions of reality that have <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/one-nation-two-realities-9780190677176?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">come to dominate American politics</a>. In essence, the Iowa and West Virginia sports cases ask the court to rule whether a transgender girl – a person assigned male at birth who has transitioned to align with their identity as a girl or woman, as the <a href=\"https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/gender-and-sexuality\">AP Stylebook</a> phrases it – is a girl or a boy.</p>\n\n<p>The court is likely to leave such questions about what is factually true for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-signals-shift-on-abortion-but-will-it-strike-down-roe-or-leave-it-to-states-to-decide-when-personhood-occurs-172934\">state legislatures to determine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The same need for the court to determine who can decide what is or is not a <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/academic-highlight-marietta-and-farley-on-the-courts-reliance-on-social-facts-to-decide-constitutional-cases/\">legitimate fact</a> also applies to this year’s controversy over <a href=\"https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Policy_Statements/2018/Conversion_Therapy.aspx\">conversion therapy</a>. Colorado bans the practice – condemned by many professional medical associations – in which counselors attempt to alter sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/chiles-v-salazar/\">Chiles v. Salazar</a> challenges the Colorado law as a violation of the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and religious liberty. </p>\n\n<p>An original reading of the First Amendment provides strong support for open expression on controversial topics, <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/spreading-medical-misinformation-physician-s-free-speech-right-it-s-complicated\">even by medical professionals</a>. But on the factual question of whether homosexuality or gender identity in young people is indisputably innate or immutable, the court may defer to state legislatures to decide whether licensed professionals must assert only a specific set of accepted facts.</p>\n\n<h2>Partisan advantage</h2>\n\n<p>Many observers perceive a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-seismic-change-has-taken-place-at-the-supreme-court-but-its-not-clear-if-the-shift-is-about-principle-or-party-190815\">partisan as well as principled divide</a> on the current court. Decisions in several cases this year potentially give a distinct advantage in future elections to Democrats or Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>The most clear case may be about the regulation of campaign finance. <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/national-republican-senatorial-committee-v-federal-election-commission/\">National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC</a> – a lawsuit begun in 2022 by then-U.S. Sen. JD Vance – asks the court to overturn a restriction that bars political parties from coordinating unlimited spending on campaign advertising with the official campaign. </p>\n\n<p>Many Democrats believe <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/30/supreme-court-nrsc-fec-coordination-limits-00432699\">Republicans will be the larger beneficiaries</a> in the coming years if the court rules that the current limits violate the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s the challenge to the constitutionality of the Trump tariffs. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/learning-resources-inc-v-trump/\">Learning Resources v. Trump</a> will determine whether the recent tariffs are authorized by Congress under the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45618\">International Emergency Powers Act</a> of 1977. The answer hinges on the application of what’s known as the “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12077\">major questions doctrine</a>,” which <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/09/the-supreme-court-tariffs-and-judicial-consistency/\">limits presidential authority</a> over issues of great economic or policy importance in the absence of direct endorsement from Congress. </p>\n\n<p>The major questions doctrine is an originalist concept, but in the court’s view it may not apply to actions in the foreign policy realm – including tariffs – where the president has greater discretion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A container ship loaded with hundres of containers, coming into a port.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692982/original/file-20250925-56-2jffa1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Will the court strike down Trump’s tariffs on imported goods such as those on this ship in Oakland, Calif.?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-an-aerial-view-a-container-ship-arrives-at-the-port-of-news-photo/2228077264?adppopup=true\">Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Race and elections</h2>\n\n<p>The case that represents all three trends at the court is <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais-2/\">Louisiana v. Callais</a> on the creation of majority-Black congressional districts.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act\">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> outlaws racial discrimination in voting. This landmark legislation from the civil rights era helped raise the rate of Black voter registration and turnout in Southern states from <a href=\"https://jointcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/VRA-report-3.5.15-1130-amupdated.pdf\">less than half the white rate to exceeding it</a> over the past 60 years. </p>\n\n<p>The question in front of the court is whether the law requires a state to make sure that some congressional districts have a majority of Black voters. </p>\n\n<p>The argument opposing the intentional creation of racial districts is that the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/14th-amendment\">equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment</a> demands the same treatment of all citizens regardless of race, banning any distinction even when designed to benefit minorities. </p>\n\n<p>Underlying the differences of opinion are competing perceptions of the prevalence and influence of racism in the current day. This dispute was clear in the court’s 2013 <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/shelby-county-v-holder/\">Shelby County</a> decision, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-a-2013-us-supreme-court-ruling-enabled-states-to-enact-election-laws-without-federal-approval-193064\">struck down</a> the part of the Voting Rights Act that limited Southern states from passing new elections laws without “pre-clearance” from the Department of Justice. That requirement aimed to ensure that new laws would not discriminate against Black voters, whether intentionally or unintentionally. </p>\n\n<p>In striking down that requirement, <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep570/usrep570529/usrep570529.pdf#page=26\">Chief Justice John Roberts ruled</a> that “no one can fairly say” that the South “shows anything approaching the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that faced Congress in 1965.” </p>\n\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep570/usrep570529/usrep570529.pdf#page=62\">responded</a> that removing the Voting Rights Act’s protections was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate number of majority-Black districts in Louisiana is not only a question of constitutional principles applied to prevailing facts. It is also about partisan advantage. Partisans on both sides are well aware that a majority-Black district is also a Democratic district. </p>\n\n<p>So whether the state ends up with two or just one – or potentially even none – of its six congressional districts shaped by race could shift the future partisan balance in a closely divided Congress.</p>\n\n<p>With partisan advantage, clashing perceptions of reality and revolutionary readings of the Constitution all in play, the rulings of the Supreme Court this year will reach far into American politics and culture.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265720/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Morgan Marietta does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Skrmetti</a> that upheld state laws <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-gender-affirming-care-a-social-worker-and-therapist-working-with-trans-people-explains-223412\">banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors</a>, such as the use of puberty-blocking hormones. LGBTQ+ persons viewed those bans as hurting the community, whereas bans like Colorado’s on conversion therapy are viewed as protecting the community.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, the legal issue in Skrmetti was different: The court addressed whether the ban violated the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/\">equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment</a>, which prohibits states from discriminating against particular protected classes, such as race or gender, absent a particularly strong state interest. In the Skrmetti decision, the court held there was no discrimination on the basis of sex, which meant the law received no heightened scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the court assessed whether there was a “rational basis” for the law and held that Tennessee had “plausible reasons” for the ban: protecting minors from harms such as sterility and treatments whose long-term effects are unclear. The court upheld the law banning gender-affirming care even though <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/population-health/what-know-about-gender-affirming-care-younger-patients\">major U.S. medical professional associations</a> oppose such bans and support such care.</p>\n\n<h2>The facts of Chiles</h2>\n\n<p>In Chiles, the issue is freedom of speech, not equal protection. But this time the Colordo ban on conversion therapy <a href=\"https://www.apaservices.org/advocacy/news/opposing-conversion-therapy\">aligns with leading medical associations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Kaley Chiles is a <a href=\"https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010111111013.pdf\">licensed professional counselor who uses talk therapy</a> in her counseling practice. Chiles identifies as Christian and often works with Christian clients. Chiles “does not try to help minors change their attractions, behavior, or identity, when her minor clients tell her <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.218037/gov.uscourts.cod.218037.1.0.pdf\">they are not seeking such change</a>.” She would like to use talk therapy with clients “who have same-sex attractions or gender identity confusion and who also prioritize their faith above their feelings” and who “<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.218037/gov.uscourts.cod.218037.1.0.pdf\">are seeking to live a life consistent with their faith</a>,” according to court filings.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.218037/gov.uscourts.cod.218037.1.0.pdf\">Chiles sued Colorado</a> to invalidate the statute as unconstitutional for violating her freedom of speech and religion under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Both the federal district court in Colorado and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit <a href=\"https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010111111013.pdf\">denied her request</a> for a preliminary injunction, rejecting both arguments. </p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court agreed only to hear her free speech claim, leaving the 10th Circuit’s rejection of her religious liberty claim in place.</p>\n\n<h2>Is ‘talk therapy’ speech or conduct?</h2>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court first will need to address whether talk therapy is protected speech under the First Amendment. This decision likely will determine the case’s outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Chiles contends that talk therapy is protected speech and that Colorado is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-539/362492/20250606115635027_24-359%20Brief%20of%20Petitioner.pdf\">impermissibly regulating the content of her potential speech</a>. The law permits her to help minor clients embrace their sexual orientation or gender identity through talk therapy but not to change it. If this therapy is speech, it would be regulating the content of her speech because the law determines what can and cannot be said. Affirming talk therapy is allowed, but conversion therapy is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado, however, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-539/370107/20250819120909432_2025.08.19%20Chiles%20v.%20Salazar%2024-539%20Respondents%20Brief%20and%20App.pdf\">insists that the statute regulates medical conduct</a>, which is not protected by the First Amendment, even if there is an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf\">incidental burden on speech</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A state undisputably can regulate medical activity, such as the prescription of a medicine. If the therapy involved the use of medicines, there would be no dispute because no speech would be involved. The Colorado conversion therapy ban is part of a broader statute, the <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_1305_signed.pdf\">Mental Health Practice Act</a>, which <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/title-12/health-care-professions-and-occupations/article-245/part-2/section-12-245-224/\">prohibits acts that could harm patients</a>. Thus, talk therapy, according to Colorado, is treatment – like providing medicine - that the state is free to regulate. </p>\n\n<p>Conversion therapy is also deemed ineffective and harmful to children by leading medical associations, such as the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/getattachment/3d23f2f4-1497-4537-b4de-fe32fe8761bf/Position-Conversion-Therapy.pdf\">American Psychiatric Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/conversion-therapy-issue-brief.pdf\">American Medical Association</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010111111013.pdf\">10th Circuit noted</a> that the Colorado ban regulates treatment, not expression, because Chiles is free to share her views on conversion therapy, even with minors. She simply cannot engage in actual therapy under the law.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"People with protest and support signs stand outside of the U.S. Supreme Court building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692775/original/file-20250924-64-bsonue.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Members of both sides of the debate stand in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2022.

The court often takes a broad view of what constitutes speech, particularly in the area of LGBTQ+ rights. In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf\">303 Creative LLC v. Elenis</a>, another case out of Colorado, the court held that creating a wedding webpage was deemed protected speech. This 2023 decision permitted the webpage designer to deny services to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1182121291/colorado-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-decision\">same-sex couples requesting webpages for their weddings</a>, in violation of Colorado’s law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>If the court concludes that conversion therapy is conduct, then the Colorado law is subject to the same standard used in Skrmetti – rational basis – and likely will survive. In light of 303 Creative, however, the court may deem it speech.</p>\n\n<h2>If talk therapy is speech, can Colorado ban it?</h2>\n\n<p>Simply because an act constitutes speech protected by the First Amendment <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does-free-speech-mean\">does not mean the state cannot regulate it</a>. For example, the state can rightly regulate defamatory statements or obscene material.</p>\n\n<p>Courts, however, apply an exacting standard of review, known as strict scrutiny, and rarely does a law survive such analysis. Colorado must show that its ban on conversion therapy is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-539/370107/20250819120909432_2025.08.19%20Chiles%20v.%20Salazar%2024-539%20Respondents%20Brief%20and%20App.pdf\">Colorado contends</a> that ensuring minors receive safe and effective mental health care is a compelling interest, and the law is narrowly tailored because “(i)t prohibits only specific harmful treatment while leaving therapists free to engage in any other appropriate therapy.” </p>\n\n<p>Chiles’ strongest argument is that the law is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-539/362492/20250606115635027_24-359%20Brief%20of%20Petitioner.pdf\">not narrowly tailored</a> for a number of reasons. Chiles contends the law is too broad because it bans more speech than necessary to protect against any harms to LGBTQ+ minors, including any therapy to change behavior, expression, identity or feeling.</p>\n\n<p>For example, she argues she could not counsel a gay client toward celibacy. It is also not properly tailored, Chiles argues, because it exposes minors to the harms of conversion therapy by its omissions: It applies only to licensed mental health professionals and not others, such as life coaches, and it applies only to minors. If conversion therapy is as harmful as Colorado alleges, these gaps show the lack of proper tailoring, says Chiles.</p>\n\n<p>The court has frequently <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1595&amp;context=vlr#\">struck down laws that regulate the content of speech</a>. If the court concludes that talk therapy is protected speech, it is likely the court will find the Colorado ban on conversion therapy unconstitutional. </p>\n\n<p>Such a decision would contrast sharply with Skrmetti. If the court strikes down the Colorado law, then a law meant to protect LGBTQ+ minors will be invalidated while one deemed harmful to trans minors will stand.</p>\n\n<p>The court again will have gone against the predominant view of medical experts in a way detrimental to the LGBTQ+ community, potentially adding to criticism of the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/03/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/#\">Supreme Court as being too political</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of The Conversation’s stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/boulder-colorado-news\">Colorado</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265529/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Timothy R.

Our class was comparing <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-salem-witch-trials-175162489/\">the Salem witch trials of the 1690s</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/mccarthyism-red-scare\">McCarthy hearings of the early 1950s</a>, when U.S. democratic processes were eclipsed by the Red Scare of purported communist infiltration.  </p>\n\n<p>The aim of the class was to better understand the concept of <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.so.20.080194.001053\">moral panics</a>, which are societal epidemics of disproportionate fear of real or perceived threats. Such outsized fear can often lead to violence or repression against certain socially marginalized groups. Moral panics are recurring themes in my research on the anthropology of <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315416175-40/stigma-time-influenza-ron-barrett-peter-brown\">fear and discrimination</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our next class meeting would apply the moral panic concept to a recent example of political violence. Tragically, there were many of these examples to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>Minnesota State Representative <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25976261-charging-documents-vance-luther-boelter-june-15-2025/\">Melissa Hortman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/18843\">her husband were assassinated</a> on June 14, 2025, which happened to be the eighth anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/media/346/download\">congressional baseball shootings</a> in which U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three other Republicans were wounded. These shootings were among <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-timeline-recent-political-violence-america/story?id=125473910\">at least 15 high-profile instances of political violence</a> since <a href=\"https://vault.fbi.gov/2011-tucson-shooting\">Rep. Gabby Gifford was severely wounded</a> in a 2011 shooting that killed five and wounded another 13 people. </p>\n\n<p>Seven of these violent incidents occurred within the past 12 months. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/pennsylvania-school-board-official-post-charlie-kirk-killing\">Kirk’s killing</a> became the eighth.</p>\n\n<p>In most of these cases, we may never fully know the perpetrator’s motives. But the larger pattern of political violence tracks with the increasing polarization of American society. While researching this polarization, I have found recurring themes of segregation and both the dehumanization and disproportionate fear of people with opposing views among liberals and conservatives alike.   </p>\n\n<h2>Segregation and self-censorship</h2>\n\n<p>The first ingredient of a moral panic is the segregation of a society into at least two groups with limited contact between them and an unwillingness to learn from one another. </p>\n\n<p>In 17th century Salem, Massachusetts, the social divisions were long-standing. They were largely based on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Salem_Possessed/FIRtMQabjJ4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">land disputes between family factions and economic tensions</a> between agriculturally-based village communities and commercially-based town communities. </p>\n\n<p>Within these larger groups, a growing number of widowed women had become <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/devilinshapeofwo00karl/page/n3/mode/2up\">socially marginalized for becoming economically independent</a> after their husbands died in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Williams-War\">colonial wars between New England and New France</a>. And rumors of continuing violence led residents in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/In_the_Devil_s_Snare/0cpvDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">towns and villages to avoid Native Americans and new settlers</a> in surrounding frontier areas. Salem was divided in many ways.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white copy of a painting depicts a trial in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693482/original/file-20250929-64-fq7ku0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=551&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The painting ‘Trial of George Jacobs of Salem for Witchcraft’ by Tompkins Harrison Matteson.

That’s when returning American veterans used their benefits to settle into suburban neighborhoods that would soon be <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Crabgrass_Frontier/pqRoAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">separated by race and class</a> through zoning policies and discriminatory lending practices. This set the stage for what has come to be called <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Big_Sort/mbjOZTx9u_cC?hl=en\">The Big Sort</a>, the self-segregation of people into neighborhoods where residents shared the same political and religious ideologies.</p>\n\n<p>It was during the early stages of these sorting processes that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/McCarthy_s_Americans/jefinONW0pQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mccarthyism+and+the+big+sort&amp;pg=PR8&amp;printsec=frontcover\">the Red Scare and McCarthy hearings</a> emerged. </p>\n\n<p>The Big Sort turned digital in the early 2000s with the rise of online information and social media platforms with algorithms that conform to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108890960\">the particular desires and biases of their user communities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, it is now easier than ever for conservatives and liberals to live in separate worlds of their own choosing. Under these conditions, Democrats and Republicans tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/697253\">exaggerate the characteristics of the other party</a> based on common stereotypes. </p>\n\n<h2>Dehumanization and discrimination</h2>\n\n<p>Dehumanization is perhaps the most crucial ingredient of a social panic. This involves labeling people according to categories that deprive them of positive human qualities. This labeling process is often conducted by “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1741659011417604\">moral entrepreneurs</a>” – people invested by their societies with the authority to make such claims in an official, unquestionable and <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/12390/the-social-construction-of-reality-by-peter-l-berger/\">seemingly objective way</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 1690s Massachusetts, the moral entrepreneurs were religious authorities who labeled people as <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/finding-the-devil-in-the-details-of-the-salem-witchcraft-trials/\">satanic witches</a> and killed many of them. In 1950s Washington, the moral entrepreneurs were members of Congress and expert witnesses who labeled people Soviet collaborators and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/10/21/why-i-wrote-the-crucible\">ruined many of their lives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the 21st century, the moral entrepreneurs include media personalities and social influencers as well as the nonhuman bots and algorithms whose authority is derived by constructing the illusion of broad consensus. </p>\n\n<p>Under these conditions, many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672231180971\">U.S. liberals and conservatives regard their counterparts</a> as savage, immature, corrupt or malicious. Not surprisingly, surveys reveal that <a href=\"https://electionstudies.org/data-tools/anes-guide/anes-guide.html?chart=affective_polarization_idelogues\">animosity between conservatives and liberals</a> has been at its highest over the past five years than any other time since the measurements first began in 1978. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"OqNzc\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OqNzc/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Adding to the animosity, dehumanization can also justify discrimination against a rival group. This is shown in social psychology experiments in which <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/iyengarwestwood2014.pdf\">conservatives and liberals discriminate against one another</a> to a greater degree than by race when deciding on scholarships and job opportunities. Such discrimination lends credence to further animosity.</p>\n\n<h2>Exaggerating fear</h2>\n\n<p>There is a fine line between animosity and disproportional fear. The latter can lead to extreme policies and violent actions during a moral panic. </p>\n\n<p>Such fear often takes the form of perceived threats. Rachel Kleinfeld, a scholar who studies polarization and political violence, says that one of the best ways to rally a political base is to make them think they are under attack by the other side. <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en\">She says</a> that “is why ‘They are out to take your x’ is such a time-honored fundraising and get-out-the-vote message.”</p>\n\n<p>In the past few years, the “x” that could be taken has escalated to core freedoms and personal safety, threats which could easily trigger widespread fear on both sides of the political divide. </p>\n\n<p>But the question remains whether exaggerated fears are sufficient to trigger political violence. Are assassins like Kirk’s killer simply pathological outliers among agitated but otherwise self-restrained populations? Or are they sensitive indicators of a looming social catastrophe?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white photo shows two men dressed in suits sitting in front of a desk.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693680/original/file-20250930-63-fbz5be.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=598&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The House Committee on Un-American Activities investigates movie producer Jack Warner, right, in Washington on Oct. 20, 1947.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=MCCARTHYISM&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Countering the panic</h2>\n\n<p>We do not have the answers to that question yet. But in the interim, there are efforts in higher education to reduce animosity and encourage constructive interactions and discussion between people with different perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>A nonpartisan coalition of faculty, students and staff – known as the <a href=\"https://heterodoxacademy.org/about/\">Heterodox Academy</a> – is promoting viewpoint diversity and constructive debates on over 1,800 campuses. The college where I teach has participated in the <a href=\"https://www.usafmc.org/congress-to-campus\">Congress to Campus</a> program, promoting bipartisan dialogue by having former legislators from different parties engage in constructive debates with one another about timely political issues. These debates serve as models for constructive dialogue.  </p>\n\n<p>It was in the spirit of constructive dialogue that my class debated whether the Kirk assassination could be explained as the product of a moral panic. Many agreed that it could, and most agreed it was probably an assault on free speech despite having strong objections to Kirk’s views. The debate was passionate, but everyone was respectful and listened to one another. No witches were to be found in the class that day.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265238/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ron Barrett does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In his 2024 book “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-war-on-warriors-pete-hegseth?variant=41763497803810\">The War on Warriors</a>,” he insisted that the inclusion of women in combat roles had drained that ethos, leaving the U.S. military less lethal.</p>\n\n<p>In his address, Hegseth outlined what he sees as the qualities and virtues the American soldier – and especially senior officers – should embody.</p>\n\n<p>On physical fitness and appearance, he was blunt: “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-hegseth-military-leaders-meeting/\">It’s completely unacceptable</a> to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world.”</p>\n\n<p>He then turned from body shape to grooming: “<a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-09-30/shaving-waivers-end-60-days-19277181.html\">No more beardos</a>,” Hegseth declared. “<a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-09-30/shaving-waivers-end-60-days-19277181.html\">The era of rampant and ridiculous shaving profiles is done</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12786/first-among-men\">historian of George Washington</a>, I can say that the commander in chief of the Continental Army, the nation’s first military leader, would have agreed with some of Secretary Hegseth’s directives – but only some. </p>\n\n<p>Washington’s overall vision of a military leader could not be further from Hegseth’s vision of the tough warrior.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in front of a US flag, looking like he is shouting and holding out his fists.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693965/original/file-20251001-56-3692bs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico on Sept. 30, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-speaks-to-senior-military-news-photo/2238288552?adppopup=true\">Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>280 pounds – and trusted</h2>\n\n<p>For starters, Washington would have found the concern with “fat generals” irrelevant. Some of the most capable officers in the Continental Army were famously overweight.</p>\n\n<p>His trusted chief of artillery, <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/henry-knox\">Gen. Henry Knox</a>, weighed around 280 pounds. The French officer <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/famous-visitors/article/marquis-de-chastellux\">Marquis de Chastellux</a> described Knox as “a man of thirty-five, very fat, but very active, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fost/blogs/weight-of-a-war-or-the-big-men-of-the-continental-army.htm\">and of a gay and amiable character</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Others were not far behind. Chastellux also described <a href=\"https://www.revolutionary-war.net/general-william-heath/\">Gen. William Heath</a> as having “a noble and open countenance.” His bald head and “corpulence,” he added, gave him “a striking resemblance to Lord Granby,” the celebrated British hero of the Seven Years’ War. Granby was admired for his <a href=\"https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/marquess-granby-benevolent-soldier\">courage, generosity and devotion to his men</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Washington never saw girth as disqualifying. He repeatedly entrusted Knox with the most demanding assignments: designing fortifications, commanding artillery and orchestrating the legendary “<a href=\"https://saratoga250.com/250th-knox-regional-commemoration/\">noble train of artillery</a>” that brought cannon from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. </p>\n\n<p>When he became president, after the Revolution, Washington appointed Knox the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-knox.htm\">first secretary of war</a> – a sign of enduring confidence in his judgment and integrity.</p>\n\n<h2>Beards: Outward appearance reflects inner discipline</h2>\n\n<p>As for beards, Washington would have shared Hegseth’s concern – though for very different reasons.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://historycollection.com/the-unique-hygiene-habits-of-our-founding-fathers/\">He disliked facial hair on himself and on others</a>, including his soldiers. To Washington, a beard made a man look unkempt and slovenly, masking the higher emotions that civility required.</p>\n\n<p>Beards were not signs of virility but of disorder. In his words, they made a man “<a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-12-02-0169\">unsoldierlike</a>.” Every soldier, he insisted, must appear in public “as decent as his circumstances will permit.” Each was required to have “his beard shaved – hair combed – face washed – and cloaths put on <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-12-02-0169\">in the best manner in his power</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>For Washington, this was no trivial matter. Outward appearance reflected inner discipline. He believed that a well-ordered body produced a well-ordered mind. </p>\n\n<p>To him, neatness was <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/john-adams-describes-george-washingtons-ten-talents-1807\">the visible expression of self-command</a>, the foundation of every other virtue a soldier and leader should possess.</p>\n\n<p>That is why he equated beards and other forms of unkemptness with “indecency.” His lifelong battle was against indecency in all its forms. “Indecency,” he once wrote, was “utterly inconsistent with that delicacy of character, which an officer <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-21-02-0261\">ought under every circumstance to preserve</a>.”</p>\n\n<h2>More statesman than warrior</h2>\n\n<p>By “delicacy,” Washington meant modesty, tact and self-awareness – the poise that set genuine leaders apart from individuals governed by passions.</p>\n\n<p>For him, a soldier’s first victory was always over himself. </p>\n\n<p>“A man attentive to his duty,” he wrote, “feels something within him that tells him the first measure is dictated by that prudence which <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-16-02-0141\">ought to govern all men who commits a trust to another</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Washington became a soldier not because he was hotheaded or drawn to the thrill of combat, but because he saw soldiering as the highest exercise of discipline, patience and composure. His “<a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/stephen-brumwell/george-washington-gentleman-warrior/9781849165464/\">warrior ethos</a>” was moral before it was martial.</p>\n\n<p>Washington’s ideal military leader was more statesman than warrior. He believed that military power must be exercised under moral constraint, within the bounds of public accountability, and always with an eye to preserving liberty rather than <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp\">winning personal glory</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In his mind, the army was not a caste apart but an instrument of the republic – an arena in which self-command and civic virtue were tested. Later generations would call him the model of the “<a href=\"https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700606832/\">republican general</a>”: a commander whose authority rested not on bluster or bravado but on composure, prudence and restraint.</p>\n\n<p>That vision was the opposite of the one Pete Hegseth performed at Quantico. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man on a white horse and in a uniform saluting a long line of soldiers in front of him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=484&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693966/original/file-20251001-84-ow2ej2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=608&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Washington formally taking command of the Continental Army on July 3, 1775, in Cambridge, Mass.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/washington-taking-command-of-the-american-army-at-cambridge-news-photo/1227157421?adppopup=true\">Currier and Ives image, photo by Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Discipline and steadiness, not fury and bravado</h2>\n\n<p>The “warrior ethos” Hegseth celebrates – loud, performative – was precisely what Washington believed a soldier must overcome.</p>\n\n<p>In March 1778, after <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/marquis-de-lafayette\">Marquis de Lafayette</a> abandoned an impossible winter expedition to Canada, Washington praised caution over juvenile bravado. </p>\n\n<p>“Every one will applaud your prudence in renouncing a project in which <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-14-02-0097\">you would vainly have attempted physical impossibilities</a>,” he wrote from the snows of Valley Forge.</p>\n\n<p>For Washington, valor was never the same as recklessness. Success, he believed, depended on foresight, not fury, and certainly not bravado.</p>\n\n<p>The first commander in chief cared little for waistlines or whiskers, in the end; what concerned him was discipline of the mind. What counted was not the cut of a man’s figure but the steadiness of his judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Washington’s own “warrior ethos” was grounded in decency, temperance and the capacity to act with courage without surrendering to rage.

Essentially, it comes down to four factors: the relative power of the legislature; how easy it is to pass a budget; the political stakes at play; and distinctive appropriation rules.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Legislative power</h2>\n\n<p>There are significant differences in how the legislatures of the U.K. and U.S. shape the budgetary process. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.K., only the executive branch – the party or coalition in power – has the <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/government-spending-how-does-parliament-approve-it\">authority to propose spending plans</a>. Parliament, which consists of members from all political parties, maintains an oversight and approval role, but it has very limited power over the budgetary timeline or <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/government-spending-how-does-parliament-approve-it\">to amend spending plans</a>. This is a stark contrast with the U.S., where Congress – which may be split or controlled by a party different to the executive – plays a far more consequential role. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. president starts the budget process by laying out the administration’s funding priorities. Yet, the Constitution grants Congress the <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Power-of-the-Purse/\">power of the purse</a> – that is, the power to tax and spend. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, past legislation has bolstered congressional control. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act helped <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/reflections-congressional-budget-act/\">curtail presidential involvement in the budgeting process</a>, giving Congress more authority over the timeline. That gave Congress more power but also offered it more opportunities to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/10/richard-nixon-congressional-budget-control-act-history-000282/\">bicker and derail the budgetary process</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Thresholds to pass a budget</h2>\n\n<p>Congress and the U.K. Parliament also differ when it comes to their voting rules. Passing the U.S. budget is inherently more complicated, as it requires the support of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>In Parliament, however, the two houses – the elected House of Commons and unelected House of Lords – are not equally involved. The two Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/parliament-acts\">limited the power of the House of Lords</a>, preventing it from amending or blocking laws relating to budgeting.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, approving the budget in Westminster requires only an absolute majority of votes in the House of Commons. That tends to be quite a straightforward hurdle to overcome in the U.K. The party in power will typically also command a majority of votes in the chamber or be able to muster one up with the support of smaller parties. It is not, however, so easy in Congress. While a simple majority suffices in the House of Representatives, the Senate still has a 60-vote requirement to close debates before proceeding with a majority vote to pass a bill. </p>\n\n<h2>3. Political stakes</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. and U.K. politicians do not face the same high stakes over budget approval. Members of Congress may eventually pay a political price for how they vote on the budget, but there is no immediate threat to their jobs. That is not so in the U.K. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the party or coalition in power in the U.K. must <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/confidence-motions-and-parliament\">maintain the “confidence” of the House of Commons</a> to stay in office. In other words, they need to command the support of the majority for key votes. U.K. governments can actually fall – be forced to resign or call for new elections – if they lose formal votes of confidence. Since confidence is also <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/confidence-motions-and-parliament\">implied in other major votes</a>, such as over the annual budget proposals, this raises the stakes for members of Parliament. They have tended to think twice before voting against a budget, for fear of triggering a dissolution of Parliament and new elections.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Distinctive appropriation rules</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, rules about appropriation also set the U.S. apart. For many decades, federal agencies could still operate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/09/us/politics/longest-government-shutdown.html\">despite funding bills not being passed</a>. That, however, changed with a ruling by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980. He determined that it would be illegal for governments to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/09/us/politics/longest-government-shutdown.html\">spend money without congressional approval</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That decision has had the effect of making shutdowns more severe. But it is not a problem that the U.K. experiences because of its distinct rules on appropriation. So-called “<a href=\"https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/articles/Tnyf75h2/votes-on-account\">votes on account</a>” allow the U.K. government “to obtain an advance on the money they need for the next financial year.”</p>\n\n<p><em>This is an updated version of an article that was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/shutdowns-are-a-uniquely-american-drama-in-the-uk-its-just-not-parliaments-cup-of-tea-213928\">first published by The Conversation U.S.</a> on Sept. 28, 2023.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266553/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Garret Martin receives funding from the European Union for the Transatlantic Policy Center, which he co-directs.</span></em></p>",

Rather, the big unknown now is whether the U.S. will follow up on threats and the sinking of drug boats with something more drastic: direct military engagement or even regime change.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is preparing for all eventualities. On Sept. 29, 2025, the leftist leader <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-maduro-signs-decree-granting-security-powers-case-military-2025-09-29/\">signed a decree</a> granting him additional powers. The following day, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-maduro-state-emergency-us-military-strikes-alleged-drug-boats/\">Maduro threatened</a> a “state of emergency.” Already, Caracas has carried out military drills amid talk of being a “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/maduro-vows-a-republic-in-arms-if-u-s-forces-in-the-caribbean-attack-venezuela\">republic in arms</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>It follows a month in which Washington has positioned warships, an attack submarine and aircraft in the Caribbean and destroyed at least four suspected “go-fast” drug boats. At the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 23, U.S. President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-warns-drug-traffickers-we-will-blow-you-out-existence-2025-09-23/\">warned of more to come</a>, vowing to blow drug traffickers “out of existence” while repeating his assertion that Maduro was behind the trafficking networks.</p>\n\n<p>Maduro and his generals deny that charge. Nonetheless, Washington has set a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/nicolas-maduro-moros\">US$50 million dollar bounty</a> on Maduro’s arrest and <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20250922-white-house-rejects-maduro-s-call-for-talks-as-us-naval-buildup-stirs-tensions\">has rejected</a> Venezuela’s appeals for talks.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://igarape.org.br/en/robert-muggah/\">expert on international security and U.S.-Latin American relations</a>, I believe the U.S. position appears to be <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/09/03/trump-usa-venezuela-regime-change-maduro-cartels/\">inching toward regime change</a> from a prior position of ambiguity that has fallen short of an outright pledge to remove Maduro. </p>\n\n<p>But Washington will be aware that any direct military engagement in Venezuela will be a messy affair. Despite increasing international isolation, Maduro still has friends in Moscow and Beijing, as well as <a href=\"https://colombiaone.com/2025/01/08/latin-america-venezuela-maduro/\">closer to home</a> in Havana. And such factors may force the Trump administration to continue to walk a fine line between maximum pressure on the Maduro government without full commitment to armed conflict.</p>\n\n<h2>US ramps up pressure</h2>\n\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/another-destroyer-showed-up-in-the-caribbean-show-of-force-2025-9\">deployments by the U.S. Southern Command</a> demonstrate a shift in posture by the U.S. administration. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/branches/navy/2025-09-23/uss-stockdale-navy-presence-caribbean-venezuela-19196878.html\">USS Stockdale</a> became the ninth U.S. Navy vessel and third destroyer – alongside USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham – to join the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group maneuvering between Puerto Rico and the Lesser and Leeward Antilles, and the waters north of Venezuela. In all, at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-defense-secretary-tells-sailors-off-puerto-rico-this-isnt-training-2025-09-09/\">4,500 Marines and sailors</a> are positioned in the area. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-plays-down-possible-regime-change-venezuela-us-deploys-stealth-fighter-2025-09-05\">10 F-35 fighters</a> and multiple MQ-9 drones are reportedly operating from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-f-35s-seen-landing-puerto-rico-amid-venezuela-tensions-2025-09-14/\">Aguadilla and Ceiba airports</a> in Puerto Rico, offering the capacity for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/another-destroyer-showed-up-in-the-caribbean-show-of-force-2025-9\">persistent surveillance</a> and strike options. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"sD4lp\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sD4lp/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These forces are more powerful than the entire Venezuelan navy but reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/trump-venezuela-military-buildup.html\">fall short</a> of the forces needed for a full-scale invasion.</p>\n\n<p>For the moment, SouthCom is framing the campaign as enhanced counternarcotics operations, rather than a prelude to a blockade or invasion. <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/Media/Special-Coverage/SOUTHCOMs-2025-Posture-Statement-to-Congress/\">Statements have highlighted</a> joint patrols and <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/Media/Special-Coverage/Operation-Martillo/\">interdiction efforts</a> with the Royal Netherlands Navy, Canada, the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom, and the humanitarian or information-sharing nature of missions. </p>\n\n<p>SouthCom <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/Media/Special-Coverage/SOUTHCOMs-2025-Posture-Statement-to-Congress/\">has described</a> its position as one of readiness, not war. But this could change, especially with the much-anticipated 2025 <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/09/25/new-pentagon-strategy-to-focus-on-homeland-western-hemisphere/\">national defense review</a> expected to prioritize countering the perceived threat of Chinese interference in the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n\n<p>And it is worth recalling that the U.S. has long maintained a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13067\">light but steady military footprint</a> in the region.</p>\n\n<h2>Caracas pushes back</h2>\n\n<p>Caracas has staged military displays of its own.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López <a href=\"https://elpais.com/america/2025-09-18/venezuela-anuncia-maniobras-militares-en-el-caribe.html\">announced on Sept. 15</a> <a href=\"https://www.elpais.cr/2025/09/17/venezuela-inicia-maniobras-militares-en-isla-caribena-la-orchila-ante-amenazas-de-eeuu/\">three days of drills</a> involving naval units, aircraft air-defense assets and militia participation. Maduro <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/venezuela-holds-major-military-drills-094807176.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jaGF0Z3B0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD_b0uDlUhDI8K5s1d4VRapLiGHAzVVHzhASXKEHTw8-lnPebXANXuJHirj7-uP7MOmL9eKpLAUt5SNpRx8MTlI61pDSfUgF_qQgGLbUori-Iyz4btwyXiMyXBpDnfCMpDoC2MQoCcfdHQH7JGyrk2uUz76P0agnP1d6OAa9M8oy\">has declared</a> “maximum preparedness” and threatened to mobilize a “republic in arms” if attacked. </p>\n\n<p>If enacted, the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/30/americas/venezuela-maduro-state-of-emergency-trump-latam-intl\">state of emergency</a> would be effective for 90 days and centralize military control in the office of the president. The aim is clear: to project resolve and raise the cost for Washington of any further escalation.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela’s military is not negligible, but <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/the-military-balance/\">readiness has been eroded</a> by decades of economic crisis, sanctions and maintenance shortfalls. It is no match for U.S. military dominance at sea or in the air, although it could inflict damage through asymmetric tactics and militia mobilization. </p>\n\n<p>On the U.S. side, the means for coercion through targeted strikes, interdictions, cyberattacks and sanctions are already at hand. Further escalation may, however, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-boat-strikes-warships-6ffd9e6f4eb738048c816c6d8257a6ef\">hinge on a catalyzing event</a>, such as an attack resulting in the killing of Venezuelan or U.S. military personnel. </p>\n\n<h2>Adversaries and allies</h2>\n\n<p>Regionally, most governments have avoided taking sides. One exception is Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who at the United Nations General Assembly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/colombia-gustavo-petro-trump-criminal-process\">called for</a> “criminal proceedings” over the recent U.S. strikes. </p>\n\n<p>In the Caribbean, there is little appetite for hosting a U.S. invasion force. The president of Dominica <a href=\"https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/news/dominica-president-warns-against-war-in-the-caribbean-amid-u-s-venezuela-tensions/\">noted in her speech at the General Assembly</a> that “there is no place in the Caribbean for war.” One exception is Guyana, which is locked in a territorial dispute with Venezuala over the oil-rich Essequibo region and <a href=\"https://guyanatimesgy.com/guyana-welcomes-us-bill-to-strengthen-defence-ties-monitor-venezuelan-aggression/\">has welcomed</a> U.S. security cooperation. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, an attack on Venezuela or an attempt at regime change risks rallying the country’s allies. </p>\n\n<p>First among them in the region is Cuba. Cuban intelligence and security advisers have <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cuban-agents-secure-nicolas-maduro-venezuelan-regime-by-jorge-g-castaneda-2024-10\">long been embedded</a> across Venezuela’s military and security services. This gives Maduro some resilience against internal coups and complicates U.S. efforts to precipitate elite defections from Maduro’s inner circle. </p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://orinocotribune.com/cubas-delegation-reaffirms-full-support-for-venezuela-in-meeting-with-president-maduro/\">expressing political support</a> for Maduro, it is highly unlikely that Cuba would ever be in a position to supplement any Venezuelan combat forces given Havana’s own weak position, struggling economy and <a href=\"https://www.globalmilitary.net/countries/cub/\">relatively modest</a> military capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>And despite <a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/russian-foreign-minister-reaffirms-support-venezuela-us-steps-military-pressure-588751\">fresh affirmations</a> of solidarity and the continued presence of Russian “military experts,” Moscow also lacks the political military bandwidth for large, new deployments. Still, long-standing military and technical ties such as training, maintenance, weapons sales and selective systems support offer Maduro a modest but valuable hedge against external pressure. </p>\n\n<p>Even a token port call or bomber overflight could add political friction – and pause for thought in Washington. Russia has sent <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/12/10/russia-sends-2-nuclear-capable-bombers-to-venezuela/\">nuclear-capable bombers</a> to Venezuela in the past, and its navy made a <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article289724459.html\">publicized visit</a> to La Guaira in July 2024. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man in army fatigues speaks and gestures in front of a large photo of another man.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694099/original/file-20251002-56-ikoeh3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez speaks in Caracas on Sept. 23, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/venezuelas-defense-minister-vladimir-padrino-lopez-speaks-news-photo/2236579420?adppopup=true\">Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Oil in the balance</h2>\n\n<p>One much more consequential factor could be the position of China. </p>\n\n<p>Beijing plays a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-oil-exports-fall-115-over-us-tariffs-sanctions-shipping-data-say-2025-04-01/\">consequential role as a buyer</a> of Venezuelan oil. As Western sanctions have set in, a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/traders-rebrand-venezuelan-oil-china-brazilian-sources-tanker-trackers-say-2025-05-12/\">growing share</a> of Venezuelan hydrocarbon exports is now funneled through “<a href=\"https://www.worldports.org/shadow-fleet-grows-to-sustain-sanctioned-oil-trade/\">shadow fleet</a>” tankers and complex <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/shadow-supply-chain-sanctions-evading-venezuelan-oil-fuels-china-refineries-2505/\">rerouting schemes</a>, allowing crude to reach Chinese refineries despite sanctions and export restrictions. </p>\n\n<p>Any U.S. campaign that disrupts these flows would hit Chinese refiners first. This would likely prompt Beijing to push back diplomatically and commercially. </p>\n\n<p>In late September, China <a href=\"https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202509/t20250926_11718172.html\">stressed that it</a> “opposes the use of force” and decried external interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs – a clear rebuke of the U.S. military buildup. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese ambassador in Caracas has also <a href=\"https://en.people.cn/n3/2025/0510/c90000-20313063.html\">conveyed solidarity</a> to his host, emphasizing that Beijing will “firmly support Venezuela in safeguarding sovereignty, national dignity and social stability.” </p>\n\n<p>China is <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3322712/china-warns-us-over-military-build-warships-head-towards-venezuela\">offering diplomatic support</a> but has stopped short of any pledge of force. </p>\n\n<p>For now, America’s most likely path is, I believe, coastal policing and military pressure. At sea, this means the U.S. continuing to lead counternarcotics operations, but with Navy cover close at hand. The U.S. buildup could well boost underground <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecba37a2-8977-4bcc-bcf3-118075bd9124\">opposition networks</a> in Venezuela, increasing pressure on the Maduro regime from within.</p>\n\n<p>This will be paired with increased financial pressure <a href=\"https://2017-2021.state.gov/sanctions-against-pdvsa-and-venezuela-oil-sector/?safe=1\">in the form of sanctions</a> aimed at further squeezing Venezuela’s state <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20250324\">oil industry</a>, but calibrated to avoid a global energy shock. Measures <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/venezuela-related-sanctions\">also include</a> restricting <a href=\"https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payment-systems/CHIPS\">dollar-clearing</a> and maritime insurance, blacklisting intermediaries and dark fleet tankers, and targeting front companies.</p>\n\n<h2>Pressure short of war</h2>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, expectations of a military clash are edging upward. Several forecasters now <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/us-x-venezuela-military-engagement-by-october-31\">put the odds</a> of some form of U.S. strike against Venezuela before year’s end at roughly 1 in 3, with the chances rising further into 2026. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the prospect of an outright invasion remains, I believe, remote. U.S. domestic politics may act as a brake: <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52958-most-americans-oppose-military-involvement-in-venezuela-maduro-poll\">Opinion polls</a> show most Americans oppose military action to topple Maduro, and an even larger majority reject the idea of a full-scale invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, three factors could shape if and when Washington steps up its action: a deadly incident at sea involving civilians or U.S. personnel; hard evidence that Venezuelan officials are directly tied to large-scale trafficking to the U.S.; and regional governments lining up behind stronger action.</p>\n\n<p>While the odds of a strike and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/us/politics/maduro-venezuela-trump-rubio.html\">even regime change</a> are rising, Washington’s strategy in the very near term appears to remain one of pressure without full commitment, using shows of force, sanctions and selective strikes to weaken Caracas while avoiding being dragged into a messy war or sparking an oil shock.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266509/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Robert Muggah is affiliated with the Igarapé Institute and SecDev. </span></em></p>",

This makes early childhood one of the most important periods for developing empathy and other <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/what-you-need-know-about-social-and-emotional-learning\">social-emotional</a> skills.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, pretend play has been a natural way to practice empathy. Many adults can remember acting out scenes as doctor and patient, or using sticks and leaves as imaginary currency. Those playful moments were not just entertainment – they were early lessons in empathy and taking someone else’s perspective. </p>\n\n<p>But as children spend more time with technology and less in pretend play, these opportunities are shrinking. Some educators worry that technology <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/11/03/bcst-children-and-technology\">is hindering social-emotional learning</a>. Yet research in affective computing – digital systems that recognize emotions, simulate them or both – suggests that technology can also become part of the solution. </p>\n\n<p>Virtual reality, in particular, can create immersive environments where children interact with characters who display emotions as vividly as real humans. I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=htxbi2gAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">human-computer interaction scientist</a> who studies social-emotional learning in the context of how people use technology. Used thoughtfully, the combination of VR and artificial intelligence could help reshape social-emotional learning practices and serve as a new kind of “empathy classroom” or “emotional regulation simulator.”</p>\n\n<h2>Game of emotions</h2>\n\n<p>As a part of my doctoral studies at the University of Florida, in 2017 I began developing a VR Empathy Game framework that combines insights from developmental psychology, affective computing and participatory design with children. At the <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/\">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Maryland, I worked with their KidsTeam program, where children of 7-11 served as design partners, helping us to imagine what an empathy-focused VR game should feel like. </p>\n\n<p>In 2018, 15 master’s students at the <a href=\"https://fiea.ucf.edu/\">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy</a> at the University of Central Florida and I created the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2022.100561\">first game prototype</a>, <a href=\"https://babayagavrgame.wordpress.com/\">Why Did Baba Yaga Take My Brother</a>? This game is based on a Russian folktale and introduces four characters, each representing a core emotion: Baba Yaga embodies anger, Goose represents fear, the Older Sister shows happiness and the Younger Sister expresses sadness.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6gMdx9zDFA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The VR game Why Did Baba Yaga Take My Brother? is designed to help kids develop empathy.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unlike most games, it does not reward players with points or badges. Instead, children can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00112\">progress in the game</a> only by getting to know the characters, listening to their stories and practicing empathic actions. For example, they can look at the game’s world through a character’s glasses, revisit their memories or even hug Baba Yaga to comfort her. This design choice reflects a core idea of social-emotional learning: Empathy is not about external rewards but about pausing, reflecting and responding to the needs of others.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I have been refining the game since then and using it to study children and empathy.</p>\n\n<h2>Different paths to empathy</h2>\n\n<p>We tested the game with elementary school children individually. After asking general questions and giving an empathy survey, we invited children to play the game. We <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2022.100561\">observed their behavior</a> while they were playing and discussed their experience afterward.</p>\n\n<p>Our most important discovery was that children interacted with the VR characters <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00222\">following the main empathic patterns</a> humans usually follow while interacting with each other. Some children displayed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.945258\">cognitive empathy</a>, meaning they had an understanding of the characters’ emotional states. They listened thoughtfully to characters, tapped their shoulders to get their attention, and attempted to help them. At the same time, they were not completely absorbed in the VR characters’ feelings.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"cartoon image a woman with horns smiling and holding her arms out theo her sides\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=691&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=691&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=691&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693739/original/file-20250930-56-wssf81.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=868&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Characters in the researchers’ VR game express a range of emotions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Ekaterina Muravevskaia</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Others expressed <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotional-contagion\">emotional contagion</a>, directly mirroring characters’ emotions, sometimes becoming so distressed by fear or sadness that it made them stop the game. In addition, a few other children did not connect with the characters at all, focusing mainly on exploring the virtual environment. All three behaviors can happen in real life as well when children interact with their peers.</p>\n\n<p>These findings highlight both the promise and the challenge. VR can indeed evoke powerful empathic responses, but it also raises questions about how to design experiences that support children with different temperaments – some need more stimulation, and others need gentler pacing.</p>\n\n<h2>AI eye on emotions</h2>\n\n<p>The current big question for us is how to effectively incorporate this type of empathy game into everyday life. In classrooms, VR will not replace real conversations or traditional role-play, but it can enrich them. A teacher might use a short VR scenario to spark discussion, encouraging students to reflect on what they felt and how it connects to their real friendships. In this way, VR becomes a springboard for dialogue, not a stand-alone tool. </p>\n\n<p>We are also exploring adaptive VR systems that respond to a child’s emotional state in real time. A headset might detect if a child is anxious or scared – through facial expressions, heart rate or gaze – and adjust the experience by scaling down the characters’ expressiveness or offering supportive prompts. Such a responsive “empathy classroom” could give children safe opportunities to gradually strengthen their emotional regulation skills. </p>\n\n<p>This is where AI becomes essential. AI systems can make sense of the data collected by VR headsets such as eye gaze, facial expressions, heart rate or body movement and use it to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3574779\">adjust the experience</a> in real time. For example, if a child looks anxious or avoids eye contact with a sad character, the AI could gently slow down the story, provide encouraging prompts or reduce the emotional intensity of the scene. On the other hand, if the child appears calm and engaged, the AI might introduce a more complex scenario to deepen their learning. </p>\n\n<p>In our current research, we are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.34190/ecgbl.18.1.2663\">investigating how AI can measure empathy</a> itself – tracking moment-to-moment emotional responses during gameplay to provide educators with better insight into how empathy develops.</p>\n\n<h2>Future work and collaboration</h2>\n\n<p>As promising as I believe this work is, it raises big questions. Should VR characters express emotions at full intensity, or should we tone them down for sensitive children? If children treat VR characters as real, how do we make sure those lessons carry to the playground or dinner table? And with headsets still costly, how do we ensure empathy technology doesn’t widen digital divides? </p>\n\n<p>These are not just research puzzles but ethical responsibilities. This vision requires collaboration among educators, researchers, designers, parents and children themselves. Computer scientists design the technology, psychologists ensure the experiences are emotionally healthy, teachers adapt them for curriculum, and children co-create the games to make them engaging and meaningful. </p>\n\n<p>Together, we can shape technologies that not only entertain but also nurture empathy, emotional regulation and deeper connection in the next generation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263181/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ekaterina Muravevskaia does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

She soon became an expert in these wartime radiology techniques, and on top of performing the measurements herself, she also spent time training nurses to use the X-ray machines. </p>\n\n<p>After the war, Irene went back to her studies in her mother’s lab at the <a href=\"https://history.aip.org/exhibits/curie/radinst2.htm\">Radium Institute</a>. This is where she met fellow researcher Frederic Joliot, whom she later married. The two worked together on many projects, which led them to their major breakthrough in 1934. </p>\n\n<h2>A radioactive discovery</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/siYMeiR1Izg?si=f-Bapnd_WWyyYo4Z\">Isotopes are variations</a> of a particular element that have the same number of protons – positively charged particles – and different numbers of neutrons, which are particles with no charge. While some isotopes are stable, the majority are radioactive and called radioisotopes. These radioisotopes spontaneously <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radioactive-decay\">transform into different elements</a> and release radiation – energetic particles or light – in a process called radioactive decay.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Irene and Frederic’s discovery, the only known radioactive isotopes came from natural ores, through a costly and extremely time-consuming process. Marie and Pierre Curie had spent years studying the natural radioactivity in <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/themes/marie-and-pierre-curie-and-the-discovery-of-polonium-and-radium/\">tons of uranium ores</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In Irene and Frederic’s experiments, they bombarded aluminum samples with <a href=\"https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation/alpha-particles\">alpha particles</a>, which consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together – they are atomic nuclei of the isotope helium-4. </p>\n\n<p>In previous studies, they had observed the different types of radiation their samples emitted while being bombarded. The radiation would cease when they took away the source of alpha particles. In the aluminum experiment, however, they noticed that even after they removed the alpha source, they could still detect radiation. </p>\n\n<p>The amount of radiation decreased by half every three minutes, and they concluded that the radiation came from the decay of a radioisotope of the element phosphorus. Phosphorus has two additional protons compared to aluminum and was formed when the alpha particles fused with the aluminum nuclei. This was the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/133201a0\">first identification</a> of an artificially made radioisotope, phosphorus-30. Because phosphorus-30 was created after bombarding aluminum with alpha particles – rather than occurring in its natural state – Irene and Frederic induced the radioactivity. So, it is called artificial radioactivity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A diagram showing an atom of 27-aluminum next to an alpha which is made of two neutrons and two protons.

In this position, she laid the foundations for what would become the <a href=\"https://eepower.com/tech-insights/irene-joliot-curie-pioneer-in-radiochemistry/#\">National Centre for Scientific Research</a>, which is the French equivalent of the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health. </p>\n\n<p>She co-created the French Atomic Energy Commission in 1945 and held a six-year term, <a href=\"https://shethoughtit.ilcml.com/biography/irene-joliot-curie/\">promoting nuclear research and development</a> of the first French nuclear reactor. She later became director of the Curie Laboratory at the Radium Institute and a professor at the <a href=\"https://curie-joliotcurie.fr/en/about-us/biographies/irene-joliot-curie-2/\">Faculty of Science in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Medical uses of artificial radioactivity</h2>\n\n<p>The Joliot-Curie discovery opened the road to the extensive use of radioisotopes in medical applications. Today, radioactive iodine is used regularly to <a href=\"https://www.thyroid.org/radioactive-iodine/\">treat thyroid diseases</a>. Radioisotopes that emit positrons – the positive equivalent of the electron – are used in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GHLBcCv4rqk?si=rbUWpn9B8p8oqWgd\">medical PET scans</a> to image and diagnose cancer, and others are used for <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine\">cancer therapy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>To diagnose cancer, practitioners can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KXzONBPcPIk?si=VeUXIg4FEiOYoAtf\">inject a small amount of the radioisotope</a> into the body, where it accumulates at specific organs. Specialized devices such as a PET scanner can then detect the radioactivity from the outside. This way, doctors can visualize how these organs are working without the need for surgery. </p>\n\n<p>To then treat cancer, practitioners use large amounts of radiation to kill the cancer cells. They try to localize the application of the radioisotope to just where the cancer is so that they’re only minimally affecting healthy tissue. </p>\n\n<h2>An enduring legacy</h2>\n\n<p>In the 90 years since the Joliot-Curie discovery of the first artificial radioisotope, the field of nuclear science has expanded its reach to roughly 3,000 artificial radioisotopes, from hydrogen to the heaviest known element, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t6t-D_Iak8c?si=T-iqoEYOeAcGpDNZ\">oganesson</a>. However, nuclear theories predict that up to 7,000 artificial radioisotopes are possible. </p>\n\n<p>As physicists, we work with data from a new facility at Michigan State University, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/powerful-linear-accelerator-begins-smashing-atoms-2-scientists-on-the-team-explain-how-it-could-reveal-rare-forms-of-matter-185754\">Facility for Rare Isotope Beams</a>, which is expected to discover up to 1,000 new radioisotopes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A graph showing protons on the Y axis and neutrons on the X axis, with an upwards trend line labeled 'stable isotopes' and a cloud of data points surrounding it labeled 'radioisotopes produced in experiments' and 'radioisotopes predicted to exist'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=405&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693675/original/file-20250930-56-w9m0bm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Scientists graph the known isotopes in the chart of nuclei.

Scientists using the facility have already discovered <a href=\"https://statenews.com/article/2024/02/researchers-at-frib-inch-closer-to-the-stars-with-discovery-of-five-new-isotopes\">five new radioisotopes</a> since it began operating in 2022, and the search continues. </p>\n\n<p>Each of the thousands of available radioisotopes has a different set of properties. They live for different amounts of time and emit different types of radiation and amounts of energy. This variability allows scientists to choose the right isotope for the right application. </p>\n\n<p>Iodine, for example, has more than 40 known radioisotopes. A main characteristic of radioisotopes is their half-life, meaning the amount of time it takes for half of the isotopes in the sample to transform into a new element. Iodine radioisotopes have half-lives that span from a tenth of a second to 16 million years. But not all of them are useful, practical or safe for thyroid treatment.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693430/original/file-20250929-66-43p36f.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram showing an atom of 131-Iodine, with an arrow to an atom of 131-Xenon, representing decay.

I knew all about the research on how an infant’s diet can affect both their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-057988\">short- and long-term health</a>. Compared to formula, breastfeeding is linked to a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, lower rates of infections and hospitalizations and a lower risk of developing diabetes later in life. Breastfeeding can also provide <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15274-benefits-of-breastfeeding\">health benefits to the parent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But I struggled to breastfeed my own firstborn. I was exhausted and in pain. My nipples were bleeding and my breasts swollen. I worried about whether my baby was getting enough to eat. And I was leaking breast milk all over the place. I found myself asking questions familiar to many new parents: What in the world is going on with breastfeeding? Can I keep this up when I go back to work? How does a breast pump even work? Why doesn’t anyone know how to help me? And why are some families able to start breastfeeding and never look back?</p>\n\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends caregivers breastfeed their child for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-057988\">up to two years</a>. However, many new parents are unable to reach these breastfeeding goals and find it very <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11102266\">difficult to get breastfeeding going</a>. Combined with inadequate support, some <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13141\">blame themselves</a> or feel like less than a good parent. </p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding-data/breastfeeding-report-card/index.html\">over 80% of families start out breastfeeding</a> their baby, roughly 19% of newborns have already received infant formula two days after birth.

Now, as a board-certified physician in breastfeeding and lactation medicine, I wanted to understand how pregnant and breastfeeding parents – and those who care for them – perceive breastfeeding. How do they define breastfeeding success? What would make breastfeeding easier, especially for underserved communities with some of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/breastfeeding-benefits-mothers-as-much-as-babies-but-public-health-messaging-often-only-tells-half-of-the-story-214543\">lowest breastfeeding rates in the U.S</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Listening to new parents</h2>\n\n<p>In partnership with the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine and Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere, a nonprofit focused on supporting breastfeeding among Black families, my team and I started a research project to identify the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2023.0297\">key components of a successful breastfeeding journey</a> as defined by parents. We also wanted to determine what would enable families to achieve their breastfeeding goals.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2023.0297\">asked a range of parents and experts</a> in the field of breastfeeding and lactation medicine about what would make breastfeeding easier for families. We recruited participants through social media, listservs and at the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine’s annual international meeting, inviting them to provide feedback through virtual listening sessions, online surveys and in-person gatherings. </p>\n\n<p>What we found is fascinating. From the perspective of the parents we talked to, success for breastfeeding had less to do with how long or to what extent they exclusively breastfed. Rather, success had a lot more to do with their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2023.0297\">experience with breastfeeding</a> and whether they had the support they needed to make it possible. </p>\n\n<p>Support included someone who could listen and help them with breastfeeding; communities that welcomed breastfeeding in public; and supportive loved ones, friends and workplaces. Having their questions about breastfeeding answered in accessible and practical ways through resources such as breastfeeding and lactation professionals in their area, peer support and websites with reliable, trustworthy information was also important to helping them feel successful in breastfeeding.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Parent sitting in chair with baby in lap, hand on temple, breast pumps in foreground\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693523/original/file-20250930-66-i5d6wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Figuring out how to make time and room for breastfeeding can be taxing.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/tired-new-mother-holding-her-baby-royalty-free-image/1282217915\">FatCamera/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Important questions about breastfeeding also arose from these conversations.

And yet, most formula use would not be necessary were barriers to breastfeeding reduced. </p>\n\n<p>Research shows that the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01931-6\">marketing practices of commercial infant formula companies</a> are predatory, pervasive and misleading. They target not only families but also health care workers. During my medical training, commercial infant formula companies would give us lectures, free lunches, and books and calculators, and my fellow residents and I knew the representatives by name. As a medical director of a newborn unit, I saw these companies stocking our hospital shelves with commercial infant formula and building relationships with our nursing staff. These companies profit when breastfeeding goes wrong.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkCxAM-oopI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The World Health Organization has advocated against aggressive commercial infant formula marketing.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This is not to say that commercial infant formula is a bad thing. When breastfeeding isn’t possible, it can be lifesaving. But in some cases, because the U.S. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-is-way-stingier-with-maternity-leave-and-child-care-than-the-rest-of-the-world-94770\">doesn’t provide universal paid maternity leave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/breastfeeding-parents-no-place-to-pump-at-work-11798117\">not all workplaces are supportive of breastfeeding</a>, parents may find themselves relying on commercial infant formula.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about breast milk and commercial infant formula less as a question of lifestyle or brand choices and more as an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-057988\">important health care decision</a> can help families make more informed choices. And health care providers can consider thinking about infant formula as a medicine for when it is necessary to ensure adequate nutrition, putting more focus on helping families learn about and successfully breastfeed. </p>\n\n<h2>Breastfeeding is a team sport</h2>\n\n<p>As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child, and breastfeeding is no exception – it is a team sport that calls upon everyone to help new parents achieve this personal and public health goal. </p>\n\n<p>What can you do differently to <a href=\"https://globalhealthmedia.org/our-projects/breastfeeding-series/\">support breastfeeding</a> in your family, neighborhood, workplace and community?</p>\n\n<p>When I am <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics/\">educating new or expectant families</a> about breastfeeding, I emphasize skin-to-skin contact whenever the parent is awake and able to monitor and respond to baby. I recommend offering the breast with every feeding cue, until the baby seems content and satisfied after each feeding. </p>\n\n<p>Manually expressing drops of milk into the baby’s mouth after each feeding can boost their intake and also ensure the parent’s body is getting signaled to make more milk. </p>\n\n<p>If your family has concerns about whether the baby is getting enough milk, before reaching for formula, ask a lactation consultant or medical professional who specializes in breastfeeding how to tell whether everything is going as expected. <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\">Introducing formula</a> can lead to decreased milk production, the baby preferring artificial nipples over the breast and stopping breastfeeding earlier than planned. </p>\n\n<p>Some parents are truly unable to continue breastfeeding for various reasons, and they should not feel ashamed or stigmatized by it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, give yourself time for breastfeeding to feel routine – both you and baby are learning.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/240396/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ann L.

      "content": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">Shohei Ohtani</a> stepped onto the field at the Tokyo Dome in March 2025, he wasn’t just playing a game – he was carrying forward more than <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/featured/japan-baseball-history\">100 years of baseball ties</a> between the U.S. and Japan. </p>\n\n<p>That history was front and center when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs opened their 2025 regular season <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/international/events/tokyo-series\">facing off in the Tokyo Series</a> on March 18 and 19. The two games featured <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/seiya-suzuki-673548\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shota-imanaga-684007\">players</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/yoshinobu-yamamoto-808967\">from</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/player/roki-sasaki-808963\">Japan</a>, capping a slate of events that included four exhibition games against Japanese professional teams. </p>\n\n<p>It was a massive financial success. Marking MLB’s first return to Tokyo since 2019, the series generated over <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/03/18/manfred-expects-tokyo-series-to-set-event-records\">US$35 million in ticket sales and sponsorship revenue</a> and <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/tokyo-series-merchandise-sets-sales-040000367.html\">$40 million in merchandise sales</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNIpKhTE24M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The first game of the Tokyo Series broke viewership records in Japan.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For MLB, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-viewership-increases-usa-japan-streaming-2025\">significant viewership growth this season</a>, it was proof that its investment in Japan and <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-global-reach-world-baseball-classic\">international baseball</a> over the past three decades has been paying off. </p>\n\n<h2>Baseball’s early journey to Japan</h2>\n\n<p>Baseball, which is by far the most popular sport in Japan, was introduced to the nation <a href=\"https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g02195/\">during the Meiji Restoration</a> in the late 19th century. </p>\n\n<p>American baseball promoters were quick to see the potential of the Japanese market, touring the country <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-1908-reach-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">as early as 1908</a>. The most famous such tour took place in 1934 and featured <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/murder-espionage-and-baseball-the-1934-all-american-tour-of-japan/\">a number of American League All-Stars</a>, including Babe Ruth and catcher Moe Berg, who was later revealed to be <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/moe-bergs-life-in-baseball\">a U.S. spy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That trip had a long legacy. The U.S. All-Stars faced a team called <a href=\"https://japanball.com/baseball/npb-teams/tokyo-yomiuri-giants/?srsltid=AfmBOoqWKZEd6wiVM0TJkiAA6rFkQocx3feJ2uD3sUE_1i9IqfCDG40I\">The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club</a>, which, a year later, barnstormed in the United States. When they played the San Francisco Seals, the Seals’ manager, Lefty O’Doul – who later trained baseball players in Japan – suggested a name change to better promote the team for an American audience. </p>\n\n<p>Commenting that Tokyo is the New York of Japan, O’Doul suggested they take on one of their team names. And since “Yankee” is a uniquely American term, The Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club was reborn as the Tokyo (Yomiuri) Giants. </p>\n\n<p>When the Giants returned to Japan, the Japanese Baseball League was formed, which was <a href=\"https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/baseball-in-japan-and-the-us-history-culture-and-future-prospects\">reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball in 1950</a>. The Giants have gone on to dominate the NPB, winning 22 Japan Series and producing <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-who-are-the-yomiuri-giants-all-to-know-about-them-ahead-of-the-tokyo-series-two-thousand-twenty-five/\">Sadaharu Oh</a>, who hit 868 home runs during his illustrious career.</p>\n\n<h2>Breaking into MLB</h2>\n\n<p>The first Japanese-born MLB player, <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/inside-pitch/murakamis-big-league-debut-changed-the-game\">Masanori Murakami</a>, debuted for the San Francisco Giants in September 1964. But his arrival wound up sparking a contractual tug-of-war between the NPB and MLB. To prevent future disputes, the two leagues signed <a href=\"https://sportslitigationalert.com/the-evolution-of-the-united-states-japanese-player-contract-agreement\">an agreement in 1967</a> that essentially blocked MLB teams from signing Japanese players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the 1990s, this agreement became untenable, as some Japanese players in NPB became frustrated by their lack of negotiating power. After the <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kintetsu_Buffaloes\">Kintetsu Buffaloes</a> refused to give Hideo Nomo a multiyear contract after the 1994 season, his agent found a loophole in the “<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/hideo-nomo-pioneered-path-to-mlb-in-1995\">voluntary retirement clause</a>” that would allow him to sign with an MLB franchise. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995. </p>\n\n<p>Nomo’s impact was immeasurable. His “tornado” windup and early success made him one of the most popular players in the major leagues, which was recovering from the cancellation of the World Series the previous year. In Japan, “<a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/hideo-nomo/\">Nomo fever</a>” took hold, with large crowds gathering television screens in public to watch him play, even though his games aired in the morning. <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-029_cf69d0f7-b1e5-41ec-8e79-ef3253c78aae.pdf\">Nomo helped drive Japanese sponsorship and television rights</a> as his first season ended with him winning National League Rookie of the Year.</p>\n\n<p>But within a few years, disputes over contracts soon showed the need for new rules. This ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-baseball-strengthened-relationship-between-united-states-japan-180968597/\">establishment of posting rules for NPB</a> players looking to transition to the major leagues. </p>\n\n<p>The rules have shifted some since they were set out in late 1998, but if a player declares their intention to leave NPB, then <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/japanese-posting-system\">MLB teams have a 45-day window to negotiate</a>. If the player from NPB is under 25 or has less than nine years of professional experience, they’re subject to the limited MLB signing pool for international players. Otherwise, they’re declared a free agent.</p>\n\n<h2>A wave of stars</h2>\n\n<p>The new rules led many more Japanese players to join major league baseball from Nippon Professional Baseball: Of the 81 Japanese players who’ve played in the majors, all but four played in NPB before their debut. Ichiro Suzuki, who became the first Japanese player <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/mariners/fans/ichiro-hall-of-fame\">inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, was also the first Japanese position player to make the leap.</p>\n\n<p>Other players, like Hideki Matsui, the only Japanese player to be named World Series MVP, continued the success. And <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/baseballs-two-way-players-from-babe-ruth-to-shohei-ohtani-and-2024-potential-draftees-like-jac-caglianone/\">then came Ohtani</a>, a two-way superstar who both hits and pitches, drawing comparisons to Babe Ruth. </p>\n\n<p>For MLB, Japanese players haven’t just boosted performance on the field – they’ve expanded its global fan base. The Dodgers brought in over <a href=\"https://www.foxla.com/sports/shohei-ohtani-made-120-million-dodgers\">$120 million in increased revenue in Ohtani’s first year alone</a>, easily covering his salary even with Ohtani signing the richest contract in baseball history. The franchise has also seen its value increase by at least <a href=\"https://www.sportspro.com/news/mlb-team-valuations-2025-yankees-dodgers-march-2025/\">23% to nearly $8 billion</a>. MLB has also seen a <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/mlb-unveils-2026-schedule-as-big-changes-loom-soon-after/\">significant increase in viewership</a> over the past two seasons, partially driven by the growing interest from Japan.</p>\n\n<p>As American sports leagues deal with an increasingly distracted, fragmented domestic audience, it’s not surprising that they’re looking abroad for growth. And as MLB teams prepare to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46139027/2025-mlb-free-agency-offseason-early-intel-contracts-schwarber-tucker-imai-bregman-alonso\">court another wave of Japanese stars this offseason</a>, it’s clear that its decades-long investment in Japan is paying off.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264668/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jared Bahir Browsh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The federal government has tracked and analyzed this data for the past three decades, but it plans to stop after publishing statistics pertaining to 2024 data. The Conversation U.S. asked Tracy Roof, a political scientist who has <a href=\"https://polisci.richmond.edu/faculty/troof/\">researched the history of government nutrition programs</a>, to explain the significance of the U.S. Household Food Security Survey and what might happen if the government  discontinues it.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What’s food insecurity?</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us\">defines food security</a> as “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” </p>\n\n<p>People who are food insecure are unsure they can get enough food or unable to get enough food to meet these basic needs because they can’t afford it.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"AqPvV\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AqPvV/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>How does the government measure it?</h2>\n\n<p>The USDA has collected data on food insecurity since the mid-1990s. It includes the share of the population that is food insecure and a subset of this group considered to have very low food security.</p>\n\n<p>People who are food insecure may not significantly reduce how much they eat, but they are likely to eat less balanced meals or lower-quality food. People with <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement\">very low food security</a> report eating less altogether, such as by skipping meals or eating smaller meals.  </p>\n\n<p>These statistics are based on answers to questions the USDA adds to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html\">Current Population Survey</a>, which the Census Bureau administers every December. There are <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement\">10 questions</a> in the survey. Households with children are asked four more.</p>\n\n<p>The questions inquire about access to food, such as whether someone has worried in the past year that their food would run out before they had enough money to buy more, or how frequently they have skipped meals, could not afford balanced meals, or felt hunger.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. food insecurity rate <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics#foodsecure\">stood at 13.5% in 2023</a>, the most recent year for which data is currently available. The final annual food security report, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ending-america-hunger-report-snap-cuts-750f90757f50ab2d8bc97dfca5a917dd\">expected in October</a>, will be issued for 2024 – based on data collected during the Biden administration’s last year.</p>\n\n<h2>Why did the government start measuring it?</h2>\n\n<p>Calls for creating the <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/blog/commemorating-history-snap-looking-back-food-stamp-act-1964\">food stamp program in the 1960s</a> led to an intense debate in Washington about the extent of malnutrition in the U.S. Until then, the government did not consistently collect reliable or national statistics on the prevalence of malnutrition.</p>\n\n<p>Those concerns reached critical mass when the Citizens’ Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition, launched by a group of anti-hunger activists, issued a report in 1968, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/22.4.480\">Hunger USA</a>. It estimated that 10 million Americans were malnourished.</p>\n\n<p>That report highlighted widespread incidence of anemia and protein deficiency in children. That same year, a CBS documentary, “<a href=\"https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/cbs-reports-hunger-in-america/\">Hunger in America</a>,” shocked Americans with disturbing images of malnourished children. The attention to hunger resulted in a significant expansion of the food stamp program, but it did not lead to better government data collection.</p>\n\n<p>The expansion of government food assistance all but eliminated the problem of malnutrition. In 1977, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/us/field-foundation-civil-rights-pioneer-to-die-at-49-survivors-will-be-legion.html\">Field Foundation sent teams of doctors</a> into poverty stricken areas to assess the nutritional status of residents. Although there were still many people facing economic hardship, <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1256803497\">the doctors found</a> there was little evidence of the nutritional deficiencies they had seen a decade earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Policymakers struggled to reach a consensus on the definition of hunger.  But the debate gradually shifted from how to measure malnutrition to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/604180\">how to estimate how many Americans lacked sufficient access to food</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Calls for what would later be known as food insecurity data grew after the Reagan administration scaled back the food stamps program in the early 1980s. Despite <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82\">the unemployment rate soaring to nearly 11%</a> in 1982 and a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2024/demo/p60-283/figure1.pdf\">steep increase</a> in the poverty rate, the number of people on food stamps <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/167036/7foodstamps.pdf\">had remained relatively flat</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Reagan administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/15/us/if-one-american-is-going-hungry-reagan-says-it-s-one-too-many.html?searchResultPosition=15\">denied that there was a serious hunger problem</a>, news reports were filled with stories of families struggling to afford food.</p>\n\n<p>Many were families of unemployed breadwinners who had never needed the government’s help before. During this period, the <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/604180\">number of food banks</a> grew substantially, and they reported soaring demand for free food.</p>\n\n<p>Because there was still <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/604180\">no government data</a> available to resolve the dispute, the Reagan administration responded to political pressure by creating a task force on hunger in 1983. It <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/01/10/President-Reagans-hunger-task-force-concluding-there-is-hunger/4683442558800/\">called for improved measures</a> of the nutritional status of Americans. </p>\n\n<p>The task force also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/129.2.510S\">pointed to the difference</a> between “hunger as medically defined” and “hunger as commonly defined.” That is, someone can experience hunger – not getting enough to eat – without displaying the physical signs of malnutrition. In other words, it would make more sense to measure access to food as opposed to the effects of malnutrition.</p>\n\n<p>In 1990 Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr1608\">National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act</a>, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law. It required the secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to develop a 10-year plan to assess the dietary and nutritional status of Americans. This <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/history-background\">plan, in turn, recommended</a> developing a standardized measurement of food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>The Food Security Survey, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/129.2.510S\">developed in consultation with a team of experts</a>, was first administered in 1995. Rather than focusing on nutritional status, it was designed to pick up on behaviors that suggested people were not getting enough to eat.</p>\n\n<h2>Did tracking food insecurity help policymakers?</h2>\n\n<p>Tracking food insecurity allowed the USDA, Congress, researchers and anti-hunger groups to know how <a href=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/09/23/usda-cancels-food-security-report-that-anti-hunger-advocates-say-showed-the-effects-of-food-policies/\">nutritional assistance programs were performing</a> and what types of households continued to experience need. Researchers also used the data to look at the causes and consequences of food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Food banks <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/feeding-america-statement-usda-annual-report\">relied on the data</a> to understand who was most likely to need their help.</p>\n\n<p>The data also allowed policymakers to see the big jump in need during the Great Recession starting in 2008. It also showed a slight decline in food insecurity with the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus\">rise in government assistance early in the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, followed by another big jump with <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings\">steeply rising food prices</a> in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">big budget bill Congress passed</a> in July will <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/big-legislative-package-shifts-more-of-snaps-costs-to-states-saving-federal-dollars-but-causing-fewer-americans-to-get-help-paying-for-food-260166\">cut spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a> by an estimated US$186 million through 2034, an almost 20% reduction.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of SNAP, the <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/history#2008%20fcea\">new name for the food stamp program adopted in 2008</a>, <a href=\"https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/250925_-_letter_to_sec._rollins_regarding_cancellation_of_usda_household_food_security_report.pdf\">worry the loss of the annual reports will hide</a> the full impact of these cuts.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RpGrZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpGrZ/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Why is the administration doing this?</h2>\n\n<p>In the brief <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/09/20/usda-terminates-redundant-food-insecurity-survey\">press release the USDA issued</a> on Sept. 20 announcing the termination of the annual food insecurity reports, the USDA indicated that the Trump administration considers the food security survey to be “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous,” and does “nothing more than fear monger.”</p>\n\n<p>While I disagree with that characterization, it is true that <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/getcontentasset/6f04791d-d297-4bfb-a03d-f1b32b822648/7ca0dc9d-611d-46e2-9fd3-26a4c03ddcbb/food_access_programs_report.pdf?language=en\">anti-hunger advocates have pointed</a> to increases in food insecurity to call for more government help.</p>\n\n<h2>Is comparable data available from other sources?</h2>\n\n<p>Although the USDA noted there are “more timely and accurate data sets” available, it was not clear which datasets it was referring to. <a href=\"https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/250925_-_letter_to_sec._rollins_regarding_cancellation_of_usda_household_food_security_report.pdf\">Democrats have called</a> on the Trump administration to identify the data.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us\">Feeding America</a>, the largest national network of food banks, releases an annual food insecurity report called the <a href=\"https://map.feedingamerica.org/\">Map the Meal Gap</a>. But like other nonprofits and academic researchers that track these trends, it relies on the government’s food insecurity data.</p>\n\n<p>There is other government data on <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foodaps-national-household-food-acquisition-and-purchase-survey\">food purchases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html\">nutritional status</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-security-in-the-united-states/documentation\">host of other surveys</a> that use USDA questions. However, there is no other survey that comprehensively measures the number of Americans who struggle to get enough to eat.</p>\n\n<p>As in the 1980s, policymakers and the public may have to turn to food banks’ reports of increased demand to get a sense of whether the need for help is rising or falling. But those reports can’t replace the USDA’s Food Security Survey.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266006/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tracy Roof does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Scott Applewhite</a></span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Congress failed to meet an Oct. 1, 2025, deadline to adopt a spending measure and keep the federal government open, resulting in the first government shutdown in nearly seven years. With both Democrats and Republicans seemingly prepared for a long fight, Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation, interviewed Charlie Hunt, <a href=\"https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-politicalscience/charles-hunt-phd/\">a congressional expert at Boise State University</a>, about the prospects of a compromise and what’s at stake for both parties.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both sides appear to be dug in. Do you see a path to a quick compromise?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Not at this point. The Democrats have made clear at least what their stated sticking point is: these <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/01/democrats-republicans-government-shutdown-health-care/\">health care subsidies</a> that are set to expire at the end of this year that were part of the Obamacare legislation. Politically speaking, this is part of a larger tactic of pushing back broadly and finally having some point of leverage against the Trump administration. The Democrats are going to use this moment to draw attention to what they see as abuses in the administration. </p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of incidents like the spectacle at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/warrior-ethos-mistakes-military-might-for-true-security-and-ignores-the-wisdom-of-eisenhower-266213\">the Department of Defense</a> (on Sept. 30), <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-01/trump-military-training-grounds-courts\">the use of the military in cities</a>, and a lot of the other uses or abuses of the Justice Department or the Trump administration. Even though those all are technically separate from the shutdown issue, it’s impossible to talk about the Democrats’ strategy without making reference to those as things that a lot of folks of the left are really upset about. And this is a vehicle by which the Democrats can push back politically and actually use some of their power to stop momentum and draw attention to what the administration is doing.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7E_HTPGD1PM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p>But on the Republican side of things, they have a pretty simple argument, which is they want to continue funding the government at current levels and the Democrats do not. Until those dynamics change, or until enough Democratic senators get nervous about the optics of what is going on, no, I don’t see a pathway out. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the White House’s power over government spending, in the form of impoundment, affect negotiations?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/what-impoundment-control-act-and-what-gaos-role\">The process of impoundment</a> is basically the executive branch declining to spend money that Congress has appropriated. Technically speaking, that is not legal under the Impoundment Act that was passed following <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-7/ALDE_00013376/\">Richard Nixon practicing this method in the 1970s</a>. If you’re the Democrats and you’re trying to negotiate for some kind of spending, for instance on these health care subsidies, and say you win a concession from the Republicans, then the Democrats might rightfully say, “Why would we even agree to this when we think there’s a chance that you’re either going to impound these funds that we’re appropriating for these subsidies, or you’re just going to have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/facing-a-shutdown-budget-negotiations-are-much-harder-because-congress-has-given-trump-power-to-cut-spending-through-rescission-265827\">another rescissions package</a> and the Republican-led Congress, with a simple majority, is just going to take these funds back? And then we haven’t won any concessions.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are key players and groups of senators and representative who might decide how long this shutdown lasts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You have people like GOP Sen. Rand Paul who are sort of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tea-Party-movement\">Tea Party</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/23/freedom-caucus-likely-to-play-a-bigger-role-in-new-gop-led-house-so-who-are-they/\">Freedom Caucus</a> wing of the party, who want to see less government spending overall, and on principal tend to oppose these continuing resolutions. He was the only Republican who voted against the GOP bill last night. I have the feeling that if Republicans like the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5531105-thune-senate-weekend-funding/\">Senate Majority Leader John Thune</a> manage to peel off a few more Democrats, and Rand Paul ends up being the deciding vote, they might be able to get him on board to pass this package. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the Senate, the real sticking points are the Democrats. You’ve got a shrinking number of moderate Democrats who could end up joining the Republicans on future votes to pass their spending bill. (You have) John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has been a bit of a wild card for the Democrats ever since he took office in 2023. Then you’ve got other more moderate Democrats from middle-of-the-road states. People like Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and others from states like Arizona or Pennsylvania, or maybe Wisconsin. But, for the most part, the Democrats have held the line. </p>\n\n<p>To me, at the end of the day it’s a question of how much leadership in these two parties can hold together their caucus. I think both <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-jeffries-leadership-test-shutdown-fight-democrats-rcna234444\">Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries</a>, the Democratic leaders in the Senate and House, respectively, have faced a ton of blowback from Democratic voters, who have made it really clear that their strategy last time was not something the left supported. So I think there’s a lot more political pressure on them this time. And (Schumer and Jeffries) are going to sort of use that pressure a lot more with their caucus members than they did last time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen surrounded by U.S. flags.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693974/original/file-20251001-56-plzwmw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen before dawn on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025, in Washington.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Government%20shutdown&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Which party stands to lose more from the political backlash of the shutdown?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s perfectly possible that we end up having this fight and there are no winners. A lot of times in these negotiations it ends up being who can save the most face. Who can get away from the fight without having lost the respect of their own supporters. </p>\n\n<p>I have the feeling that most Democratic senators understand that Republicans are not going to suddenly give in on these health care subsidies, or that Donald Trump is going to suddenly say, “You know what, you’re right. We shouldn’t use the military in American cities.” Or that (Director of the Office of Management and Budget) Russell Vought is suddenly going to say, “You’re right. The executive branch should really stop impounding funds and we’re just going to give you what you want.” The Democrats understand that, but they are trying to demonstrate to their voters that they are going to do some kind of fighting and use whatever small leverage they do have. </p>\n\n<p>I think there is more on a policy basis for the Democrats to lose just based on their ideological principles. There are plenty of Republicans that, frankly, are happy to see the government shut down, to demonstrate to the American people that “hey, look, you don’t need this much government, you can get away with less, this is a good opportunity maybe to cut a bunch of government programs, do mass firings of federal workers, as the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/01/congress/russ-vought-mass-layoffs-firings-timeline-shutdown-00589875\">OMB director</a> has suggested.” Whereas the Democrats favor more robust social safety net programs and more government spending to achieve their goals. </p>\n\n<p>So the longer the government stays shut down, the less funding those programs are going to get. In that sense, the Democrats have more to lose. On the other hand, the Republicans can lose a lot in terms of public relations because of who is leading their party. </p>\n\n<p>I think Donald Trump demonstrated in the last shutdown, back in 2018-2019, that he has a great deal of difficulty not making these fights all about him, at least from a public perspective. That doesn’t tend to go well for him because he’s a pretty unpopular president, because he tends to bite off more than he can chew in fights like these. And that’s something the Democrats can use to their advantage from a public relations or communications perspective, in terms of talking to their voters. </p>\n\n<p>But the question is going to be: How much of that is worth the losses that are going to be incurred if we’re talking about a government that is shut down for weeks or even months? That’s going to be a lot of pain for Americans. Then it just turns to who ends up getting the blame. And I don’t think we know enough yet.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266450/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charlie Hunt does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

From there, she went on to become a global icon and a <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/06/jane-goodall/\">United Nations Messenger of Peace</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jane-goodall-obit-78698397851bc7634717206f7eba07b2\">Until her death on Oct. 1, 2025 at age 91</a>, Goodall retained a charm, open-mindedness, optimism and wide-eyed wonder that are more typical of children. I know this because I have been fortunate to spend time with her and to share insights from <a href=\"https://www.mireyamayor.com/\">my own scientific career</a>. To the public, she was a world-renowned scientist and icon. To me, she was Jane – my inspiring mentor and friend.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the massive changes Goodall wrought in the world of science, <a href=\"https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nat16.sci.lisci.goodall/how-jane-goodall-changed-the-study-of-animal-behavior/\">upending the study of animal behavior</a>, she was always cheerful, encouraging and inspiring.

One of her greatest gifts was her ability to make everyone, at any age, feel that they have the power to change the world.  </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcL4jnGTL1U?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jane Goodall documented that chimpanzees not only used tools but make them – an insight that altered thinking about animals and humans.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Discovering tool use in animals</h2>\n\n<p>In her pioneering studies in the lush rainforest of Tanzania’s Gombe Stream Game Reserve, <a href=\"https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/national_parks/gombe-national-park\">now a national park</a>, Goodall noted that the most successful chimp leaders were gentle, caring and familial. Males that tried to rule by asserting their dominance through violence, tyranny and threat <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2016/11/02/gombe-gets-new-alpha-fall-ferdinand/\">did not last</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also am <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mireya-I-Mayor-78099910\">a primatologist</a>, and Goodall’s groundbreaking observations of chimpanzees at Gombe were part of my preliminary studies. She famously recorded chimps taking long pieces of grass and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/2011264a0\">inserting them into termite nests</a> to “fish” for the insects to eat, something no one else had previously observed. </p>\n\n<p>It was the first time an animal had been seen using a tool, a discovery that altered how scientists differentiated between humanity and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Renowned anthropologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Leakey\">Louis Leakey</a> chose Goodall to do this work precisely because she was not formally trained. When she turned up in Leakey’s office in Tanzania in 1957, at age 23, Leakey initially hired her as his secretary, but he soon spotted her potential and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees-jane-goodalls-story/1911/\">encouraged her to study chimpanzees</a>. Leakey wanted someone with a completely open mind, something he believed most scientists lost over the course of their formal training. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C3-gbAYOaQu&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Because chimps are humans’ closest living relatives, Leakey hoped that understanding the animals would <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/\">provide insights into early humans</a>. In a predominantly male field, he also thought a woman would be more patient and insightful than a male observer. He wasn’t wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Six months in, when Goodall wrote up her observations of chimps using tools, Leakey wrote, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or <a href=\"https://nhm.org/stories/chimpanzees-redefining-what-it-means-be-human\">accept chimpanzees as human</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Goodall spoke of animals as having emotions and cultures, and in the case of chimps, communities that were almost tribal. She also named the chimps she observed, an unheard-of practice at the time, <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/\">garnering ridicule from scientists</a> who had traditionally numbered their research subjects.   </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg1xQVosKV3&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>One of her most remarkable observations became known as the <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/a-brief-history-of-the-gombe-chimpanzee-war\">Gombe Chimp War</a>. It was a four-year-long conflict in which eight adult males from one community killed all six males of another community, taking over their territory, only to lose it to another, bigger community <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2018/07/10/top-bottom-chimpanzee-social-hierarchy-amazing/\">with even more males</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Confidence in her path</h2>\n\n<p>Goodall was persuasive, powerful and determined, and she often advised me not to succumb to people’s criticisms. Her path to groundbreaking discoveries did not involve stepping on people or elbowing competitors aside.  </p>\n\n<p>Rather, her journey to Africa was motivated by her wonder, her love of animals and a powerful imagination. As a little girl, she was entranced by Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1912 story “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/78\">Tarzan of the Apes</a>,” and she loved to joke that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cS3BA0GwWM\">Tarzan married the wrong Jane</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a 23-year-old <a href=\"https://usasciencefestival.org/people/dr-mireya-mayor/\">former NFL cheerleader</a>, with no scientific background at that time, and looked at Goodall’s work, I imagined that I, too, could be like her. In large part because of her, I became a primatologist, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10764-006-9036-1\">co-discovered a new species of lemur in Madagascar</a> and have had an amazing life and career, in science and on TV, as <a href=\"https://explorer-directory.nationalgeographic.org/mireya-mayor\">a National Geographic explorer</a>.<br>\nWhen it came time to write <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/644663116?oclcNum=644663116\">my own story</a>, I asked Goodall to contribute the introduction. She wrote: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Mireya Mayor reminds me a little of myself. Like me she loved being with animals when she was a child. And like me she followed her dream until it became a reality.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cS3BA0GwWM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a 2023 interview, Jane Goodall answers TV host Jimmy Kimmel’s questions about chimpanzee behavior.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Storyteller and teacher</h2>\n\n<p>Goodall was an incredible storyteller and saw it as the most successful way to help people understand the true nature of animals. With compelling imagery, she shared extraordinary stories about the intelligence of animals, from apes and dolphins to rats and birds, and, of course, the octopus. She inspired me to become a wildlife correspondent for National Geographic so that I could share the stories and plights of endangered animals around the world. </p>\n\n<p>Goodall inspired and advised world leaders, celebrities, scientists and conservationists. She also touched the lives of millions of children. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two women face each other, smiling and holding a book\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/595537/original/file-20240521-17-qsw10h.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jane Goodall and primatologist Mireya Mayor with Mayor’s book ‘Just Wild Enough,’ a memoir aimed at young readers.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Mireya Mayor</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Through the <a href=\"https://janegoodall.org/\">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, which works to engage people around the world in conservation, she launched <a href=\"https://janegoodall.org/our-work/our-approach/roots-shoots/\">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, a global youth program that operates in more than 60 countries.

Just a month earlier, <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/09/27/we-choose-to-stand-here-annunciation-marks-one-month-since-mass-shooting\">two people died</a> and 21 were injured during a Mass for students at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>These tragedies may feel sudden and senseless, but they are part of a longer pattern that we have been tracking.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iS4HAEMAAAAJ\">We are criminologists</a> who have <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hoHQX8MAAAAJ\">studied violence</a> for decades. In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.hamline.edu/violence-prevention-project-research-center/research\">we created a public database</a> of homicides that occur in houses of worship across the United States. It now spans nearly 25 years of incidents, documenting how often these attacks happen, who perpetrates them, what weapons are used, when and where they occur, and how deadly they are.</p>\n\n<h2>What the numbers show</h2>\n\n<p>From 2000 to 2024, the dataset records 379 incidents and 487 deaths at religious congregations and religious community centers. Most involved a single victim, but some – like the recent shootings in Michigan and Minnesota – killed or injured many people.</p>\n\n<p>About 7 in 10 incidents involved firearms, accounting for three-quarters of the deaths. Firearm cases averaged about 1.4 deaths each, compared with 1.1 for nonfirearm cases. </p>\n\n<p>Handguns were the most common weapon, linked to more than 100 incidents and 147 deaths. But semiautomatic rifles, though used in only seven cases, killed 46 people — more than six per attack, on average.</p>\n\n<p>The deadliest year was 2017, when 47 people were killed at places of worship, 42 of them with firearms. Twenty-six of those people were killed in a single catastrophic shooting at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/church-shooting-texas.html\">First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs</a>, Texas.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"zUxAU\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zUxAU/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>‘Mass shootings’</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081122-010256\">Mass shootings</a> are often defined as attacks that kill four or more people. Using that threshold, the data shows 10 incidents since 2000 at houses of worship. Lower the bar to three killed, and there are 14; at two killed, 40.</p>\n\n<p>Definitions shape perception. Most people associate mass shootings with high-profile tragedies like the massacres at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/17/nx-s1-5422299/mother-emanuel-10-years-racist-attack-charleston-church\">Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in 2015 or <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/mass-shooter-found-guilty-of-murdering-11-people-at-tree-of-life-synagogue-in-2018\">Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue</a> in 2018. But many other attacks, like the tragedy at Annunciation in Minneapolis, involve two or three deaths. Each represents a profound loss for a community.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man with a white beard, wearing a black sports cap and a cross necklace, somberly holds up a lit candle amid a crowd outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693682/original/file-20250930-56-vz489n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Attendees attend a vigil at Holy Redeemer Church in Burton, Mich. on Sept. 28, 2025, following a shooting at a nearby chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/USChurchShootingMichigan/b509f3547b2a4cef9f535bb4c93c0b6b/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Jose Juarez</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the cases where four or more people were killed, every perpetrator was a man in his 20s to 40s, with an average age of 32. Compared with other homicides at worship sites, these shooters were far more likely to have a history of mental health problems: 60% vs. 18%. They were also far more likely to have been thinking about or planning suicide – 70% vs. 17% – and to die by suicide during or after the attack: 60% vs. 10%.</p>\n\n<p>There were other similarities, too. Among attackers who killed four or more people, 20% had served in the military, and 60% had a criminal background. Among attackers who killed fewer people, those numbers were 4% and 43%. Deadlier shooters more often leaked their plans or showed signs of being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/26/opinion/us-mass-shootings-despair.html\">in crisis beforehand</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>When and where</h2>\n\n<p>Violence is most likely to strike on Sundays – a quarter of all cases – followed by Saturdays. That reflects worship patterns: Sundays are the busiest day for most Christian denominations, while Saturdays are common for Jewish services.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents cluster around mornings and nights, with mornings most common — the prime window for weekly services. And despite headlines about shootings inside sanctuaries, 71% of homicides occurred outside – in parking lots, courtyards or on steps – when people were gathering or leaving.</p>\n\n<p>In two-thirds of cases, it was unclear whether the perpetrator had a connection with the congregation. Most of the other cases, though, involved attackers with clear ties, including members, relatives, pastors and employees. In dozens of cases, domestic disputes spilled into worship settings. Because services are routine, predictable gatherings, they can become flash points for private conflicts that turn deadly.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks happened across the nation, but were concentrated in the South. The region tends to have more <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/16/how-religious-is-your-state/\">frequent attendance at religious services</a> and <a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/\">looser firearm laws</a> – a combination that helps explain the South’s overrepresentation, though no region is untouched.</p>\n\n<h2>Which faiths are affected</h2>\n\n<p>Ninety-seven percent of deadly incidents occurred at Christian churches, reflecting how many there are in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>But, adjusting for the number of congregations, the data underscores other faiths’ vulnerability to targeted violence. Jewish and Muslim houses of worship, community centers <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/dozens-graves-jewish-cemetery-defaced-swastikas-offensive-graffiti/story?id=93325341\">and cemeteries</a>, for example, contend with <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/nationwide-anti-mosque-activity\">frequent threats</a> <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/antisemitic-incident-data-breaks-all-previous-annual-records-2024-fourth\">and vandalism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Only one incident at <a href=\"https://pluralism.org/the-gurdwara\">a gurdwara – a Sikh temple</a> – appears in the dataset. Because there are so few in the U.S., though, that single case translates into the highest rate for any faith tradition, once the total number of congregations are taken into account. Stabbings or shootings also occurred at six Jewish synagogues and community centers, further suggesting disproportionate risk. </p>\n\n<p>Two incidents involved mosques. Yet that contrasts with data showing <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/new-cair-data-shows-anti-muslim-anti-palestinian-hate-remain-elevated-in-first-half-of-2024/\">high levels of Islamophobia</a> in the U.S., suggesting that most <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/ethnic-and-cultural-studies/anti-muslim-violence-us\">violence against Muslims</a> may occur in other settings.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman's face is illuminated by the candle she holds, and she and a man beside her stand in a crowd at night.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693690/original/file-20250930-66-36gvqw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People attend a vigil on Aug. 5, 2013, to mark the one-year anniversary of a shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/anju-bhatia-and-indi-biring-join-members-of-the-sikh-temple-news-photo/175658762?adppopup=true\">Scott Olson/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why this research matters</h2>\n\n<p>Homicides in houses of worship remain rare, but when they occur, firearms make them deadlier.

Every year, there are hundreds of <a href=\"https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/\">attempts to challenge or ban books</a>, targeting thousands of titles.</p>\n\n<p>According to the nonprofit free speech advocacy group <a href=\"https://pen.org/\">PEN America</a>, there have been nearly 16,000 book bans in U.S. public schools and libraries since 2021, a number not seen <a href=\"https://pen.org/banned-books-list-2025/\">since the 1950s under McCarthyism</a>. The actual number of bans likely is much higher, since not every book ban gets officially reported.</p>\n\n<p>During the 2020s, book banning has become a viral phenomenon. Small, conservative nonprofits such as <a href=\"https://glaad.org/gap/moms-liberty/\">Moms for Liberty</a>, founded in 2021, have developed and expanded their advocacy for book bans at the local, state and national levels. These groups position themselves as defenders of <a href=\"https://www.communityvoiceks.com/2023/10/14/inside-the-book-ban-machine-the-rise-of-parental-rights-groups-and-their-efforts-to-ban-books/\">parental rights against obscenity in education</a>, while interpreting “obscenity” broadly enough to include <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/parents-rights-groups-have-mobilized-what-does-it-mean-for-students/2023/08\">so-called “woke” ideologies</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"z7abz\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z7abz/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>And while not all efforts to ban books are successful, these groups have been extremely effective. For example, from July 2021 to June 2022 there were <a href=\"https://pen.org/book-bans/banned-book-list-2021-2022/\">2,532 instances of books being banned</a> across 32 states, affecting 1,648 different books, according to <a href=\"https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/\">the “Banned in the USA” report</a> by PEN America.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2023, we were part of a team that <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/2024/05/01/how-to-judge-a-banned-book-by-its-cover-part-2-of-the-banned-books-project/\">researched book bans</a> enacted over the course of the 2021-2022 school year. We found that during this period, the books’ covers appeared just as likely to lead to a ban as the words on the page.</p>\n\n<h2>Targeting diversity</h2>\n\n<p>Many organizations work to protect books that depict the vibrancy of American culture, including <a href=\"https://pen.org/topic/banned-books/\">PEN America</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/bbooks\">American Library Association</a>, the <a href=\"https://authorsguild.org/banned-books-club/\">Authors Guild</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thebannedbookclub.info/\">Digital Public Library of America</a>. Their scholarship has consistently shown that the contemporary book banning movement is a transparent effort to suppress depictions of cultural, racial, sexual and gender diversity in public education.</p>\n\n<p>Most media coverage has focused on frequently targeted books, such as George M. Johnson’s memoir “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354808/banned-books-library-most-challenged\">All Boys Aren’t Blue</a>” or Maia Kobabe’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/books/maia-kobabe-gender-queer-book-ban.html\">Gender Queer</a>.” Yet these works represent only a small percentage of the wide range of titles that are being banned. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the broader array of books challenged and banned during the 2021-2022 school year, our research showed that this organized effort has consistently targeted representations of minorities in children’s and young adult books, both fiction and nonfiction.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Table showing picture books titled 'I Am Jazz,' 'Pride,' and 'and Tango Makes Three.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=414&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693456/original/file-20250929-56-dt20lq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many banned books have cover art that depicts racial, gender, cultural or other forms of diversity.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Kriti Baru</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Judging books by their covers</h2>\n\n<p>Our research team purchased <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/2024/05/01/climbing-a-mountain-of-books-with-distant-reading-part-1-of-the-banned-books-project/\">more than 1,600 books</a> that PEN America had reported as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eU3rCvzLjBwnVpph_Svs8MFmnp9EH8RG_72UofANVeM/edit?gid=1822899714%23gid=1822899714\">challenged or banned in the 2021-2022 school year</a>. We digitized physical copies and converted e-books to create a data set for scholarly analysis.</p>\n\n<p>As we examined each book, <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/2024/05/01/how-to-judge-a-banned-book-by-its-cover-part-2-of-the-banned-books-project/\">clear patterns emerged</a>. The vast majority of the books had been published since 2000. Nonfiction titles, which made up one-fourth of the total, were often written to help children engage with complex topics in age-appropriate ways. </p>\n\n<p>For example, “<a href=\"https://www.marshall.edu/library/bannedbooks/its-perfectly-normal/\">It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health</a>” featured illustrations and scientific language to teach children about their changing bodies. Another book, “<a href=\"https://thebannedbook.shop/products/peaceful-fights-for-equal-rights\">Peaceful Fights for Equal Rights</a>,” used lyrical writing and cut-paper collages to teach children about civil disobedience.</p>\n\n<p>Other books seemed to be targeted for no discernible reason, beyond having narrators or protagonists who were children of color. Typically, these fictional stories explored uncontroversial topics. Examples include “<a href=\"https://www.annamcquinn.com/banned-books.html\">Lola at the Library</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.lovessciencebooks.com/cece-loves-science\">Cece Loves Science</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>All of these books’ covers depicted racial, gender or sexual diversity. This made us wonder whether book banishers were simply judging books based on their cover art, rather than the content of their stories. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CR9A0hmL-2e&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Who’s in the picture?</h2>\n\n<p>When we looked at the 1,648 books banned in the 2021-2022 school year, our qualitative analysis found that the book covers most often depicted women, people of color or LGBTQ identities. Over 80% of books targeted for bans included human figures, and roughly two-thirds of the books with figures on the cover featured nonwhite characters and characters who appear female. Even when book covers displayed white characters, one-third placed them beside people of color.  </p>\n\n<p>While 30% of banned books with figures on the cover featured only white characters, more than half of these – over 200 books – exhibited only characters who did not look conventionally male and highlighted feminist or LGBTQ topics and perspectives. Less than 10% – only 98 books – presented solely white, male characters on the cover. Of this group, over 10% still depicted some kind of romantic, same-sex relationship. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the book cover designs alone, our research team determined that the vast majority of the books selected for banning explicitly represented racial, gender and sexual minorities in their cover art. The remainder typically focused on mental health issues, broadly speaking. </p>\n\n<p>Across all the books we examined, the cover art consistently reflected the contents of the books. In addition, most of the banned books also contained language in their titles and summaries visible on the back cover that further signaled topics pertaining to issues of diversity.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAsEJ29xV-A?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">While books banned in the U.S. include classics such as George Orwell’s “1984,” content focusing on race, sex and gender accounts for the largest share of banned titles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A broader attack on libraries</h2>\n\n<p>Until 2025, book bans were enacted at the local and state levels. Now, however, the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/news/trump-administration-ramps-attacks-public-libraries\">attacking public resources more generally</a>, affecting not just youth but anyone who uses public libraries. </p>\n\n<p>In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/education-dept-ends-book-ban-investigations.html\">ended its role investigating book bans</a>. For fiscal year 2026, the administration is <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/FY%202026%20IMLS%20Congressional%20Justification_0.pdf\">proposing to eliminate</a> the federal <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, which provides about <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/imls-budget-table-fy-2023-2025.pdf\">US$211 million annually in grants and support for museums and libraries</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>By monitoring and censoring the titles that libraries can carry, book bans ultimately serve to discredit these institutions’ authority and justify defunding them.  </p>\n\n<p>As the U.S. observes <a href=\"https://bannedbooksweek.org/\">Banned Books Week</a> from Oct. 5-11, 2025, we believe it is more vital than ever for the public to understand the value of public schools and libraries. One promising development occurred in August 2025, when a federal judge <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/federal-judge-overturns-part-of-floridas-book-ban-law-drawing-on-nearly-100-years-of-precedent-protecting-first-amendment-access-to-ideas-263893\">overturned a Florida book ban law</a> on First Amendment grounds. This ruling may offer some hope for similar challenges to book bans in other states.</p>\n\n<p>Banning books doesn’t remove cultural, racial, sexual or gender diversity from U.S. communities. But it can remove depictions of a diverse society from public schools and neighborhood libraries. </p>\n\n<p>Bans also undermine the professional authority of teachers, librarians and authors, all of whom work hard to guide young people to find books that will help them develop and broaden their horizons. Removing books from schools and libraries only jeopardizes these institutions’ mission to promote free and open access to information in the communities where Americans live and learn.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255807/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alex Wermer-Colan received funding from the Mellon Foundation.\n\nAlex Wermer-Colan is the Managing Editor of the Programming Historian in English and the Executive Director of Philly Community Wireless.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>SaraGrace Stefan received funding from the Mellon Foundation. </span></em></p>",

The local flood control district estimates that <a href=\"https://stormwater.wef.org/2022/07/houston-eyes-30-billion-tunnel-project-to-avoid-future-flooding/\">at least one major flood occurs</a> within its service area every two years.</p>\n\n<p>There are two competing potential options to contain these floods with tunnels to direct excess water out of the city to the coast – one from the local flood control district board and one from Elon Musk’s Boring Company, with the <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-08-28/elon-musk-texas-houston-flood-hurricane-tunnels-boring\">backing of a local member of Congress</a>. The two proposals differ significantly in size, capacity, cost and expected completion time.</p>\n\n<p>And in late August 2025, county commissioners said they would begin to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-08-28/elon-musk-texas-houston-flood-hurricane-tunnels-boring\">study a third option, combining elements of both</a> – using <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26070451-hcfcd-pilot-study-flood-tunnels-one-pager/\">just two tunnels</a>, like Musk’s proposal, but <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26070451-hcfcd-pilot-study-flood-tunnels-one-pager/\">larger ones</a> than Musk had indicated, with their sizes in line with the local flood control district’s recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>The choice between these three options involves a balancing act between taxpayer dollars, engineering and forecasting about future storms and flooding.</p>\n\n<p>As researchers at Texas A&amp;M University who study <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=x45RIOYAAAAJ&amp;utm\">disaster resilience</a> – including <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=W6EPWyYAAAAJ&amp;utm_\">engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=SUDDNJAAAAAJ&amp;utm\">community planning</a>, coastal geotechnics and hurricane surge modeling – we bring complementary expertise to analyzing this complex discussion.

Wesley Hunt</a>, who represents part of the city and its surrounding suburbs, would involve <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-wesley-hunt-houston-tunnels-boring-co\">two tunnels, each 36 miles long and 12 feet in diameter</a>, running from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs to the ocean at the Port of Houston. </p>\n\n<p>They would also be more shallow than the larger proposal, <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-08-28/elon-musk-texas-houston-flood-hurricane-tunnels-boring\">15 to 30 feet below the surface</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This project would cost an estimated $760 million. The timeline is unclear – the company says it can <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26070534-the-boring-company-capabilities-houston-reservoir-drainage-tunnels/\">bore as much as a mile a month</a>, though its fastest boring project to date, in Las Vegas, averaged <a href=\"https://www.boringcompany.com/vegas-loop\">49 feet per day</a>, which would be more than three months per mile. The company has previously been contracted to build transportation tunnels, but it has <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-08-28/elon-musk-texas-houston-flood-hurricane-tunnels-boring\">never built flood control tunnels</a>. It seems reasonable to conclude that boring the proposal’s <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-08-28/elon-musk-texas-houston-flood-hurricane-tunnels-boring\">combined 72 miles of tunnels</a> would take several years.</p>\n\n<h2>The engineering reality: Size matters</h2>\n\n<p>A tunnel’s ability to carry water increases exponentially with its diameter: A tunnel with a 30-foot diameter can carry <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/pipe-flow\">roughly 39 times as much water</a> as a 12-foot-diameter tunnel. Even two 12-foot-diameter tunnels, combined, would carry <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2025-09-12/fact-checking-elon-musk-response-boring-houston-tunnels\">less than one-fifth as much water</a> as a single 40-foot-diameter tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>Houston experiences flash flooding multiple times per year from routine storms that drop 4 to 6 inches of rain in a few hours. Even moderate storms cause problems: Storms that statistically occur every two years cause flooding in areas such as the Second Ward and Greater Fifth Ward because of <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicworks.org/buffalo-bayou-watershed\">outdated storm sewers</a>. And storm severity is increasing: Rain amounts that once were expected once every 100 years <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-updates-texas-rainfall-frequency-values\">now happen every 25 years</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And Hurricane Harvey dumped <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/reviewing-hurricane-harveys-catastrophic-rain-and-flooding\">1 trillion gallons in Harris County in four days</a>. Some locations received <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/post-harvey-report-provides-inundation-maps-and-flood-details-largest\">over 60 inches of rainfall</a>, about <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/post-harvey-report-provides-inundation-maps-and-flood-details-largest\">15 inches more than average annual amounts</a> for eastern Texas.</p>\n\n<p>During Harvey, nearly every river, creek and bayou in southeast Texas flooded. <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/hgx/hurricaneharvey\">About 90% of the area’s waterway monitoring stations</a> recorded some amount of flooding. And nearly half of all waterway stations reported <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/crp/hurricane_harvey\">more flooding than ever recorded before</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in an orange helmet wades through chest-deep water while another man stands nearby in waist-deep water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=422&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692546/original/file-20250923-56-e8zn0j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=531&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The release of water from Addicks Reservoir in Houston during Hurricane Harvey flooded homes and neighborhoods.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/luis-perez-of-the-texas-army-national-guard-goes-house-to-news-photo/840627644\">Erich Schlegel/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Our analysis of the projects’ capacities finds that they would all be overwhelmed in a Harvey-scale event delivering <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/post-harvey-report-provides-inundation-maps-and-flood-details-largest\">over 50 inches of rain</a>, with most of Houston experiencing a <a href=\"https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/hurricane-harvey-data\">1,000-year storm</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We have calculated that Musk’s two tunnels could handle only about 0.9% of Harvey’s water, while the county’s full eight-tunnel system would handle roughly 39% of Harvey’s rainfall. Without technical details, the best we can say is that the third tunnel option would likely fall in between those two capacities. </p>\n\n<p>All the systems could provide protection against more routine flooding. The price tag for Musk’s proposal is significantly lower and could have some benefits, but it might divert funding from approaches that could handle even more water. </p>\n\n<p>The Harris County Flood Control District’s <a href=\"https://www.hcfcd.org/Community/Press-Room?post=Flood+Control+District+releases++Phase+2+results+of+Tunnel+Feasibility+Study\">feasibility study</a> found that the eight large-diameter tunnels could significantly reduce the severity of <a href=\"https://stormwater.wef.org/2022/07/houston-eyes-30-billion-tunnel-project-to-avoid-future-flooding/\">120,000 instances of flooding over the next 100 years</a> across 11 of 23 major watersheds in Harris County. The other 12 watersheds would need separate projects to address their vulnerabilities. Smaller tunnels, or fewer of them, would provide proportionally less protection. </p>\n\n<p>Musk’s proposal would primarily benefit areas near the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, helping to drain them quickly during major rain events. But most of Houston’s flooding problems are <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/houston-harvey-drainage-1.4267585\">not a result of reservoir overflows</a>. Rather, they happen in older neighborhoods with <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/overflowing-sewers-flood-downtown-houston-streets/285-9182d481-52c3-4fc5-afef-158154dc517f\">storm sewers that are too small</a> to handle the amount of rain Houston regularly receives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Houston’s geological challenge</h2>\n\n<p>While all the projects would have the bulk of the tunnels <a href=\"https://www.houstonpermittingcenter.org/office-city-engineer/design-and-construction-standards\">below utility lines</a>, Houston’s geology still makes tunnel construction complex. </p>\n\n<p>The Gulf Coast region consists of <a href=\"https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2021/02/04/sinking-situation-of-subsidence-in-houston-gulf-coast/\">sand, silt, and clay – very young soils</a> that <a href=\"https://webapps.usgs.gov/houston_subsidence/\">haven’t compacted yet</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2022-news-articles/october-2022/10112022-houston-subsidence.php\">ground is already sinking</a> in areas such as Katy, Spring, The Woodlands, Fresno and Mont Belvieu. Any tunnel construction would need to account for continued subsidence over the tunnels’ lifespan.</p>\n\n<p>The area’s <a href=\"https://stormwater.wef.org/2022/07/houston-eyes-30-billion-tunnel-project-to-avoid-future-flooding/\">high groundwater table</a> would increase water pressure on the tunnels themselves, with more complex soil conditions the deeper a tunnel went. Initial excavation, access shafts from the surface to the tunnels, and pumping stations would all cost more than they would in harder soil with a lower water table.</p>\n\n<p>There are other approaches Houston continues to explore, in addition to the tunnels, including <a href=\"https://www.harriscountyfws.org/\">improving early warning systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hcfcd.org/Activity/Projects\">expanding basins for holding excess water</a>, <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Despite-massive-projects-to-upgrade-Houston-12725685.php\">improving the flow channels of existing streams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Despite-massive-projects-to-upgrade-Houston-12725685.php\">creeks and bayous</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-hill-country-floods-buyouts-property-fixes-20774258.php\">expanding voluntary buyout programs</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The engineering verdict</h2>\n\n<p>Musk’s proposal faces several engineering limitations. The 12-foot tunnels cannot handle Harvey-scale flooding due to insufficient capacity. The shallow boring approach through Houston’s unstable soils presents significant geological challenges. The limited scope addresses only <a href=\"https://www.hcfcd.org/Activity/Projects/Countywide-or-Multi-Watershed/Countywide-Capital-Projects/Solutions-for-Advancing-Floodplain-Evaluation-and-Resilience-SAFER-Study\">two of the county’s 23 watersheds</a>, leaving most flood-prone areas unprotected.</p>\n\n<p>The flood control district’s plan would offer more protection, but not to the whole area nor in a way that would prevent another Harvey-level flooding disaster. </p>\n\n<p>The hybrid option being studied by county commissioners could provide a middle ground, offering better capacity than Musk’s tunnels while potentially being cheaper and faster to build than the full district plan. But its pros and cons remain largely theoretical until detailed engineering studies are completed. </p>\n\n<p>All three options would provide some flood protection, but none would completely solve Houston’s flooding challenges. The question becomes whether to invest in incremental improvements that help with routine flooding or pursue more expensive and more comprehensive solutions that provide greater protection against catastrophic events. </p>\n\n<p>As Houston’s vulnerable communities face intensifying storms, we believe the city needs solutions that work when catastrophe strikes – not just during routine flooding.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265352/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dr. Ivis García has received funding from the National Science Foundation; the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; the U.S. Department of Transportation&#39;s National Institute for Transportation and Communities; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; JPB Foundation; Ford Foundation, Pritzker Traubert Foundation; Chicago Community Trust, SBAN, Texas Appleseed, Fundación Comunitaria de Puerto Rico, Urban Institute &amp; UNIDOS, and Natural Hazards Center. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James M.

Since 1998, that has been the case for foreign companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges or acting in the U.S., too.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Trump administration, however, expectations are changing. In February 2025, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/\">an executive order</a> froze new investigations for 180 days, arguing that the act has been “stretched beyond proper bounds” and “harms American economic competitiveness.” The president ordered a review of enforcement guidelines to ensure they advance U.S. interests and competitiveness.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act/fcpa-guidelines\">revised guidelines</a>, issued in June 2025, prioritize cases that are tied to cartels and other transnational criminal organizations, harm U.S. companies or their “fair access to compete,” or involve “infrastructure or assets” important for national security.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever impact the new guidelines will have on <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/117726/transnational-survival-foreign-corrupt-practices/\">anti-corruption prosecutions globally</a>, which is still unclear, the impact on the actual level of corruption will likely be small. Legal rules and sanctions designed to deter, find and punish “bad apples” have had <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/understanding-success-and-failure-of-anti-corruption-initiatives\">limited success in many parts of the world</a>. Yet the United States’ retreat from leadership could set back momentum for addressing the root causes of corruption.</p>\n\n<h2>New anti-corruption norm, but limited change</h2>\n\n<p>In 1977, when the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law, the U.S. was alone in criminalizing bribery of foreign officials. Since then, and especially since the end of the Cold War, there’s been a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66254-1_12\">paradigm shift</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, a global infrastructure of treaties and institutions obligates countries to criminalize corruption, adopt measures to prevent it and cooperate to recover stolen assets. All but a few members of the United Nations have adopted the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/corruption/en/uncac/learn-about-uncac.html\">U.N. Convention Against Corruption</a>. Substantial amounts of international aid have also been allocated to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. In 2021 alone, the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/committees/development-assistance-committee.html\">Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> invested over US$7.5 billion <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/peace-and-official-development-assistance_fccfbffc-en.html\">for reforms related to fighting corruption</a>, from anti-corruption courts to public financial management.</p>\n\n<p>Yet global trends in corruption, widely defined as <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/what-is-corruption\">the “abuse of entrusted power for personal gain</a>,” are not improving. On the <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024\">2024 Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, the most widely used global ranking of public sector corruption, two-thirds of countries scored below 50 on a scale where 0 is “very corrupt” and 100 is “very clean.” And while 32 countries had reduced corruption since 2012, 148 had either stayed the same or gotten worse. </p>\n\n<p>Corruption, it turns out, can be <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/mapping-evidence-gaps-in-anti-corruption-assessing-the-state-of-the-operationally-relevant-evidence-on-donors-actions-and-approaches-to-reducing-corruption\">stubbornly resistant</a> <a href=\"https://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/DFIDs-Approach-to-Anti-Corruption-and-its-Impact-on-the-Poor-FINAL.pdf\">to “best practices</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A beige sign with illustrations of one hand holding money reaching out toward another hand signaling 'stop.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=418&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693354/original/file-20250929-56-zdhpzg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=525&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A sign at a Congolese hospital reminds patients that payments directly to staff are not allowed.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/photo-essay-in-a-hospital-in-congo-struggle-against-news-photo/151035588?adppopup=true\">BSIP/Universal Images Group Via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>A few examples illustrate this “whack-a-mole” dynamic. Medical personnel in Ugandan hospitals began to <a href=\"https://dlprog.org/publications/research-papers/islands-of-integrity-reductions-in-bribery-in-uganda-and-south-africa-and-lessons-for-anti-corruption-policy-and-practice/\">solicit “gifts” and “appreciation</a>” after the government imposed greater oversight and penalties for bribery. A study of World Bank efforts in over 100 developing countries to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105000\">clean up procurement corruption</a> found that gains in one area were canceled out when government buyers started to use procedures not subject to the new rules.

One key factor <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/\">we</a> (and <a href=\"https://giace.org/\">many others</a>) found is that most conventional anti-corruption tools are addressing the wrong problem.</p>\n\n<p>The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar measures focus on preventing, detecting and punishing individual acts of corruption. Rules requiring reporting and asset declarations, monitoring and oversight, and criminal penalties for corruption belong to this category. These tools try to limit the power people have over decisions and resources and <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/how-anti-corruption-change-happens\">increase accountability and transparency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This approach works where corrupt acts are sporadic, opportunistic deviations from the norm by “bad apples” acting to enrich themselves. It also assumes that rule of law and robust institutions exist.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of people sit on the ground and along a cement wall, all facing one way, under a blue sky.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693357/original/file-20250929-56-hou7k1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Filipinos protest on Sept. 21, 2025, in Manila after corruption was uncovered in flood control projects that have embroiled officials, engineers, contractors and politicians.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/filipinos-take-part-in-a-protest-against-corruption-at-news-photo/2236510953?adppopup=true\">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>This is not the case in much of the world – especially in <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/states-of-fragility-2025_81982370-en.html\">fragile and conflict-affected states</a> where corruption is endemic. By “endemic,” I mean not just that corruption is widespread, but that it is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10999922.2025.2520679\">embedded in politics and the economy</a> – a “team effort” within broad networks, with informal rules of the game. As an Afghan official reportedly <a href=\"https://www.sigar.mil/Reports/Article-Display/Article/4020349/corruption-in-conflict-lessons-from-the-us-experience-in-afghanistan/\">told U.S. Embassy officials in 2010</a>, endemic corruption “is not just a problem for the system of governance … it is the system of governance.” </p>\n\n<p>What makes the conventional anti-corruption tool kit so ineffective in contexts of endemic corruption?</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1. It does not pay to follow the rules.</strong> Without trusted leaders and institutions to implement the law, it is difficult for people to behave honestly, as they don’t trust that others will do the same. Corruption, in this sense, is a “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x\">collective action” problem</a>. If corruption is the norm, not the exception, the short-term costs of sticking to the rules are too high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2. Corruption serves a useful function – even when it undermines the public good.</strong> Even when people believe it’s wrong, corruption can <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/08/corruption-nigeria\">solve problems</a> that seem unsolvable in their current system. For example, <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/understanding-the-multiple-social-norms-behind-informal-payments-in-the-health-sector-of-nigeria\">health workers in Nigeria often ask for bribes</a> because their salaries are low and clinics lack needed supplies. The money helps them fulfill family obligations and make clinics work. Similarly, politicians often practice patronage because it <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecaffa/v26y2006i4p19-23.html\">helps them redistribute wealth to retain supporters and stabilize conflict</a>. Unless dysfunction is addressed, incentives to bypass the rules remain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3. Informal institutions prevail over formal rules.</strong> When a government cannot be relied upon to provide security, services or livelihoods, people <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/understanding-social-norms%3A-a-reference-guide-for-policy-and-practice\">rely on their personal networks</a> to survive. As a judge in the Central African Republic <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/pity-the-man-who-is-alone%3A-corruption-in-the-criminal-justice-system-in-bangui%2C-central-african-republic\">told our research team</a>, “If someone [within your social network] asks for a service, you are required to do it, even if it goes against your own ethics. To refuse is to put oneself in opposition [to one’s clan] and this can be dangerous.”</p>\n\n<h2>Loss of leadership</h2>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://voxdev.org/topic/institutions-political-economy/foreign-corruption-regulation-helps-african-communities\">does not mean</a> that conventional anti-corruption approaches are completely ineffective or irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren’t enough on their own. They work best hand in hand with interventions that address motivating factors – from low pay to a lack of livelihoods not dependent on corruption, to social norms that motivate people to seek bribes or make them hesitate to enforce the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, momentum has built to develop these <a href=\"https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CIPE-How-To-Guide-to-Anti-Corruption-Messaging-2-1.pdf\">new approaches</a> – though it is still early to assess their effectiveness. Some focus on fixing government dysfunction. Others help unite people and groups <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/collective-action-against-corruption-in-the-criminal-justice-system\">trying to resist corruption</a>. Some projects <a href=\"https://ace.soas.ac.uk/publication/case-study-reducing-corruption-in-climate-infrastructure-in-bangladesh/\">support “horizontal” monitoring</a> by peer firms or communities, instead of government regulation, or <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/leveraging-behavioral-insights-to-mitigate-public-procurement-corruption-in-nigeria/\">try to “nudge” behaviors</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/03/taking-action-against-corruption-nigeria\">change social norms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The limitations of existing anti-corruption approaches suggest that more limited enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is not likely, by itself, to worsen global corruption. But the loss of U.S. leadership may.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. role in anti-corruption progress cannot be understated – as a leader in “<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/publications/exporting-corruption-2022\">policing” foreign corruption</a>, a model for other countries’ laws and institutions, and a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/16/fact-sheet-u-s-achievements-in-the-global-fight-against-corruption/\">leading donor</a>. It is still unclear whether others – such as the U.K., the most <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/new-world-order-us-uk-international-anti-corruption-enforcement-2025-07-23/\">likely and dedicated candidate</a> – can fill the gap. </p>\n\n<p>Equally concerning, in my view, is the danger that the U.S. turn to a more self-serving view of anti-corruption efforts may encourage a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/117726/transnational-survival-foreign-corrupt-practices/\">corrupt use of anti-corruption enforcement</a>. Many authoritarian governments have <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/rethinking-anti-corruption-in-de-democratising-regimes\">weaponized anti-corruption laws</a> to target political opponents through selective prosecutions.</p>\n\n<p>If the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is used this way, this could not only undermine the legitimacy of global anti-corruption norms but <a href=\"https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/items/how-anti-corruption-efforts-can-inadvertently-fuel-conflict\">exacerbate conflict</a> and <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/rethinking-anti-corruption-in-de-democratising-regimes\">fuel democratic backsliding</a> at home and abroad.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263894/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Diana Chigas receives funding for her research from The MacArthur Foundation, Transparency International Canada and the Wellspring Philanthropic Fund through Besa Global, Inc., a social enterprise in Canada dedicated to improving anti-corruption effectiveness in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.</span></em></p>",

For centuries, death has been a topic of fascination for authors and readers alike. My own <a href=\"https://www.victoriannetwork.org/index.php/vn/article/view/127\">research</a> focuses on death in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Victorian-era\">Victorian era</a>, a period of British literature extending from 1837 to 1901, but what is it about the subject of death more broadly that both attracts and repels? </p>\n\n<p>When I had the chance to propose a special topics course in literature in fall 2024, I knew I wanted to craft a course that attempts to unpack why the topic of death is fascinating for people to both write and read about. Happily, my proposal was accepted, and I am currently teaching a course called “Death, Dying, and the Undead.”</p>\n\n<h2>What does the course explore?</h2>\n\n<p>Grave robbing, premature burial, murder, terror and grief are some of the topics explored through the study of poetry, short stories and novels.</p>\n\n<p>We look at how authors write about death, from the visceral horror of dying in battle depicted by Wilfred Owen in his 1920 poem, “<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46560/dulce-et-decorum-est\">Dulce et Decorum Est</a>,” to the devastating intimacy of loss in Edna St. Vincent Millay’s 1928 poem “<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52773/dirge-without-music\">Dirge Without Music</a>” – and every death-related theme in between. </p>\n\n<p>Students also explore themes of madness, mayhem and sudden death in 19th century <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Gothic-novel\">Gothic</a> and 20th century <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Southern-Gothic\">Southern Gothic</a> short stories. In these stories, death is often figured as an interruption, an unexpected event that occurs when characters are busy doing other things. </p>\n\n<p>It is futile to attempt to hide from death, a fact illustrated by Edgar Allan Poe in his 1842 short story “<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/951743308\">The Masque of the Red Death</a>.” In this story, Prince Prospero, the prince of an unnamed region, tries to evade the “Red Death” by abandoning his people and isolating himself and other noblemen in a fortified abbey. But death finds them there – “And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all,” as the story goes. </p>\n\n<p>Death is inevitable, but cannot always be anticipated. In Flannery O'Connor’s 1953 short story “<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1086214236\">A Good Man is Hard to Find</a>,” an entire family is murdered by an escaped criminal called The Misfit in the midst of a mundane family road trip. As they are marched into the woods one by one for execution, their disbelief mirrors the reader’s: This can’t really be happening, can it?  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, we end the semester with novels about continued bodily animation after death – including Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel, “Frankenstein,” and Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel, “Dracula.” This unit is particularly interesting to my students majoring in forensic anthropology – meaning the recovery and examination of human remains. Some of these students spend time working at the University of Tennessee’s “<a href=\"https://fac.utk.edu/body-donation/\">body farm</a>,” where they study donated human remains. </p>\n\n<p>The students unite their understanding of inevitable bodily decay with literature that imagines the opposite – bodies that either don’t break down or can be reused.  Class conversations here range from how bodies are treated after death to 19th century scientific advancements and how authors creatively imagine the possibility that a body could be reanimated after death. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white drawing shows a person with a wide expression in their eyes sitting on what seems to be a skull\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=888&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=888&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=888&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1116&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1116&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693457/original/file-20250929-56-7g4olg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1116&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An illustration from the second edition of the horror story ‘Frankenstein’ was published in London in 1831.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/illustration-from-the-second-edition-of-the-horror-story-news-photo/924759392?adppopup=true\">Fototeca Gilardi/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why is this course relevant now?</h2>\n\n<p>As Halloween reminds people annually, everyone is going to die someday. This knowledge, paired with literature attempting to navigate the great unknown that yawns ahead, encourages students to reflect on mortality, personal values, different perspectives and how they want to live. As the poet and novelist D.H. Lawrence writes in his 1932 poem “<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/13427250\">The Ship of Death</a>,” “We are dying, we are dying, we are all of us dying/and nothing will stay the death-flood rising within us.” </p>\n\n<h2>What’s a critical lesson from the course?</h2>\n\n<p>While an entire class dedicated to literary representations of death may appear morbid, a focus on death and dying provides an excellent jumping-off point for an exploration of what it means to be human, with all of our worries, hopes, longings and dreads. Ultimately, this dark and foreboding-sounding class is spirited and life-affirming.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white photo shows a woman lying in a bed sleeping, while a man wearing a black jacket and white shirt leers over her.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693463/original/file-20250929-56-x0vevn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=520&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Students in this course read the Gothic novel ‘Dracula,’ as depicted in the 1931 film.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/dracula-1931-film-bela-lugosi-as-count-dracula-and-frances-news-photo/588253486?adppopup=true\">Culture Club/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What will the course prepare students to do?</h2>\n\n<p>This course prepares students to critically think about challenging subjects, like the literary portrayal of the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53087/out-out\">death of a child</a> or <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49000/lady-lazarus\">suicidal ideation</a>.

According to a 2023 report from <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2023-cs-smartphone-research-report_final-for-web.pdf\">Common Sense Media</a>, 97% of students between the ages of 11 and 17 use their cellphones at least once during the school day. These students spend a median of 43 minutes online each day during school hours. Social media, YouTube and gaming were the students’ top cellphone uses.</p>\n\n<p>Schools have already begun taking action. Data from the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/2_19_2025.asp\">National Center for Education Statistics</a> published in 2025 shows that 77% of public schools ban cellphones during classes. Thirty-eight percent of schools have cellphone policies that restrict use outside of class as well – including during free periods, between classes or during extracurricular activities.</p>\n\n<p>Policymakers in different states and educators in school districts across the country are putting into place a variety of solutions. Some rely on partial restrictions, while others enforce complete bans. </p>\n\n<p>Many are still searching for the balance between technology access and minimizing distraction. </p>\n\n<p>What is clear, however, is that cellphones have become one of the central issues shaping today’s classroom environment.</p>\n\n<h2>The role of technology in the classroom</h2>\n\n<p>As researchers and professors who study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2020.1795500\">the integration of technology</a> for <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323140102_Technology's_role_and_place_in_student_learning_What_we_have_learned_from_research_and_theories\">teaching and learning</a> – and who are also parents of school-aged children – we firmly believe that digital technologies are no longer optional add-ons. They have become indispensable in modern classrooms, acting as versatile instruments for instruction, collaboration and student engagement. </p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, the ongoing shift <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.6muqg7s5p\">from traditional paper textbooks to digital ones</a>. This transformation has broadened access and created new opportunities for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/making-the-most-of-k-12-digital-textbooks-and-online-educational-tools-146898\">interactive, personalized learning</a>. Abundant evidence demonstrates the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654310393361\">positive effects of technology</a> in supporting students’ engagement in class and their academic performance. </p>\n\n<p>Students’ access to digital devices has improved significantly as schools across the United States continue investing in technology infrastructure. A <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/10_17_2023.asp\">2023 report from the National Center for Education Statisitics</a> indicates that 94% to 95% of public schools now provide devices to students who need them – although disparities exist between states. </p>\n\n<p>A growing number of districts are adopting <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/technology/during-covid-19-schools-have-made-a-mad-dash-to-1-to-1-computing-what-happens-next/2021/04\">1:1 initiatives</a>, ensuring that every student has access to a personal device such as a laptop or tablet. These initiatives accelerated after the COVID-19 pandemic made clear the need for reliable access to learning technologies in schools for all students. They highlight the central role technology now plays in shaping everyday classroom instruction. </p>\n\n<p>These technologies hold great educational potential. Yet, when not integrated thoughtfully and regulated effectively, they can inadvertently reduce focus and undermine learning. </p>\n\n<p>Our recent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-025-10550-6\">systematic review on digital distraction in classrooms</a>, which synthesized 26 empirical studies, finds three main drivers of distraction among students:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Technology-related factors</strong> included constant social networking, texting and cellphone addiction. These accounted for over half of the reported distractions. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Personal needs,</strong> such as entertainment, made up more than one-third.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Instructional environment,</strong> including classroom instruction that isn’t engaging, poor classroom management and difficult course content, accounted for the rest. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To address these challenges, the authors of the papers we reviewed suggested strategies such as teaching students how to control their own behavior and focus, silencing notifications, issuing clear device policies or banning devices. </p>\n\n<p>The studies in our review also drew a clear distinction between school-provided and personally owned mobile devices. Devices provided by schools are typically equipped for instructional purposes, enhanced with stronger security and designed to restrict distracting uses. Personal devices are far less regulated and more prone to off-task use. </p>\n\n<p>As schools increasingly provide devices designed for learning, the role of personal cellphones in classrooms becomes harder to justify as they present more risks of distraction than educational benefits.</p>\n\n<h2>Laws and policies regarding cellphone use</h2>\n\n<p>Several states in the U.S. have passed laws banning or restricting cellphone use in schools, with some notable differences.</p>\n\n<p>States vary in how they define wireless communication devices. In Michigan, <a href=\"https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2025-2026/billanalysis/Senate/pdf/2025-SFA-0234-U.pdf\">Senate Bill 234</a>, passed in May 2025, describes a wireless communication device as an “electronic device capable of, but not limited to, text messaging, voice communication, entertainment, navigation, accessing the internet, or producing email.” </p>\n\n<p>While most of the states have several technology types listed under wireless communication devices, a Colorado bill passed in May 2025 clearly identified that laptops and tablets did not fall under <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_1135_signed.pdf\">the list of restricted wireless communication devices</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A white teen sits outside absorbed in her phone.

Other exceptions in the North Carolina bill include an emergency, when students’ individual education programs call for it, and a documented medical condition.</p>\n\n<p>In their bills, most states provide recommendations for school districts to create cellphone use policy for their students. To take one typical example, the policy for Wake County in North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.wcpss.net/cellphones\">one of the state’s largest school districts</a>, specifically refers to personal wireless communication devices. For elementary and middle school students, they must be silenced and put away between morning and afternoon bells, either in a backpack or locker. For high school students, teachers may allow them to be used for lessons, but they must otherwise be silenced and put away during instructional time. They can be used on school buses with low volume and headphones.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256968/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

To that end, he and like-minded donors established the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which successfully lobbied for the creation of the first federal anti-obscenity laws with enforcement provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Later appointed inspector for the Post Office Department, Comstock fought to abolish whatever he deemed blasphemous and sinful: birth control, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/proposed-federal-abortion-ban-evokes-19th-century-comstock-act-a-law-so-unpopular-it-triggered-the-centurylong-backlash-that-led-to-roe-188681\">abortion aids</a> and information about sexual health, along with certain art, books and newspapers.

However, it also inspired greater support for free speech and due process. </p>\n\n<h2>More popular – and more profitable</h2>\n\n<p>One effect of Comstock’s censorship campaigns: The materials and speech he disfavored often made headlines, putting them on the public’s radar as a kind of “forbidden fruit.” </p>\n\n<p>For example, prosecutions targeting artwork featuring nude subjects led to both sensational media coverage <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679370\">and a boom</a> in the popularity of nudes on everything from soap advertisements and cigar boxes to photographs and sculptures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of bald man with mutton chops.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=815&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693365/original/file-20250929-93-10r22w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1024&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Anthony Comstock.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/anthony-comstock-an-american-fanatical-and-anti-vice-news-photo/515607790?adppopup=true\">Bettmann/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, entrepreneurs of racy forms of entertainment – promoters of belly dancing, publishers of erotic postcards and producers of “living pictures,” which were exhibitions of seminude actors posing as classical statuary – all benefited from Comstock’s complaints. If Comstock wanted it shut down, the public often assumed that it was <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679370\">fun and trendy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1891, Comstock <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25102226?seq=1\">became irate</a> when a young female author proposed paying him to attack her book and “seize a few copies” to “get the newspapers to notice it.” And in October 1906, Comstock <a href=\"https://starkcenter.org/igh/igh-v1/igh-v1-n4-n5/igh0104c.pdf\">threatened to shut down</a> an exhibition of models performing athletic exercises wearing form-fitting union suits. Twenty thousand people showed up to Madison Square Garden for the exhibition – far more than the venue could hold at the time.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s recent efforts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/25/jimmy-kimmel-trump-abc-un\">to get comedian Jimmy Kimmel off the air</a> have similarly backfired. </p>\n\n<p>Kimmel had generated controversy for comments he made on his late-night talk show in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination. ABC, which is owned by The Walt Disney Co., initially acquiesced to pressure from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr and announced the show’s “indefinite” suspension. But many viewers, angered over the company’s capitulation, canceled their subscriptions of Disney streaming services. This led to a 3.3% drop in Disney’s share price, which spurred <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/jimmy-kimmel-disney-investors-politics-fiduciary-duty.html\">legal actions by shareholders</a> of the publicly traded company.</p>\n\n<p>ABC soon lifted the suspension. Kimmel returned, drawing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-24/kimmel-s-first-show-since-suspension-draws-6-3-million-viewers\">6.26 million live viewers</a> – more than four times his normal audience – while <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/jimmy-kimmel-disney-youtube-26-million-ratings-sinclair-nexstar/\">over 26 million viewers</a> watched Kimmel’s return monologue on social media. Since then, all network affiliates have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/sinclair-to-return-jimmy-kimmel-live-show-tonight-disney-says\">resumed airing</a> “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</p>\n\n<h2>‘Comstockery’ and hypocrisy</h2>\n\n<p>In the U.S., disfavored political speech and obscenity <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-first-amendment-protects-americans-speech-and-how-it-does-not-265655\">are different in important ways</a>. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides broad protections for political expression, whereas speech deemed to be obscene is illegal. </p>\n\n<p>Despite this fundamental difference, social and cultural forces can make it difficult to clearly discern protected and unprotected speech. </p>\n\n<p>In Comstock’s case, the public was happy to see truly explicit pornography removed from circulation. But their own definition of what was “obscene” – and, therefore, criminally liable – was much narrower. </p>\n\n<p>In 1905, Comstock attempted to shut down a theatrical performance of George Bernard Shaw’s “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” because the plot included prostitution. The aging censor was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1905/09/29/archives/shaw-and-comstock.html\">widely ridiculed</a> and became a “laughing stock,” according to The New York Times. Shaw went on to coin the term “Comstockery,” which caught on as a shorthand for overreaching censoriousness. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Cartoon of young women booting an older man down some steps.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=253&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=253&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=253&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693382/original/file-20250929-56-kbdd8p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cartoonists at the turn of the 20th century had a field day with Anthony Comstock’s overreaches.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GDpEdvVNL.jpg\">Amazon</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In a similar manner, when Attorney General Pam Bondi recently threatened Americans that the Department of Justice “will absolutely … go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech,” <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5506688-trump-administration-charlie-kirk/\">swift backlash</a> ensued. </p>\n\n<p>Numerous Supreme Court rulings have held that <a href=\"https://firstamendmentwatch.org/hate-speech-fighting-words/\">hate speech</a> is constitutionally protected. However, those in power can threaten opponents with punishment even when their speech clearly does not fall within one of the rare exceptions to the First Amendment protection for political speech. </p>\n\n<p>Doing so carries risks.</p>\n\n<p>The old saying “people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones” also applies to censors: The public holds them to higher standards, lest they be exposed as hypocrites.</p>\n\n<p>For critics of the Trump administration, it was jarring to see officials outraged about “hate speech,” only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/trump-kirk-memorial-hate.html\">to hear the president announce</a>, at Charlie Kirk’s memorial, “I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them.”</p>\n\n<p>In Comstock’s case, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/anopenlettertos00benngoog\">defendants and their attorneys</a> routinely noted that Comstock had seen more illicit materials than any man in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25118217?seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents\">Criticizing Comstock</a> in 1882, Unitarian minister Octavius Brooks Frothingham quoted <a href=\"https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/twelfth-night/read/2/3/\">Shakespeare</a>: “Who is so virtuous as to be allowed to forbid the distribution of cakes and ale?” </p>\n\n<p>In other words, if you’re going to try to enforce moral standards, you better make sure you’re beyond reproach.</p>\n\n<h2>Free speech makes for strange bedfellows</h2>\n\n<p>Comstock’s censorship campaign, though self-defeating in the long run, nonetheless caused enormous suffering, just as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/us/kirk-critics-fired-free-speech.html\">many people today are suffering</a> from calls to fire and harass those whose viewpoints are legal, but disliked by the Trump administration.  </p>\n\n<p>Comstock prosecuted women’s rights advocate <a href=\"https://www.sexradicalmovie.com/\">Ida Craddock</a> for circulating literature that advocated for female sexual pleasure. After Craddock was convicted in 1902, she died by suicide. She left behind a “<a href=\"https://www.idacraddock.com/public.html\">letter to the public</a>,” in which she accused Comstock of violating her rights to freedom of religion and speech. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Portly man wearing a hat and a full body suit gingerly stepping into a bathtub.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=618&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=618&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=618&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693392/original/file-20250929-56-83bsly.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=777&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 1906 cartoon in the satirical periodical Puck mocks Anthony Comstock as a prude.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/illustration-depicts-the-st-anthony-comstock-the-village-news-photo/160176791?adppopup=true\">PhotoQuest/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>During Craddock’s trial, the jury hadn’t been permitted to see her writings; they were deemed “too harmful.” Incensed by these violations of the First and Fourth amendments, defense attorneys rallied together and were joined by a new coalition in the support of Americans’ constitutional rights. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1228985\">Lincoln Steffens of the nascent Free Speech League wrote</a>, in response to Craddock’s suicide, that “those who believe in the general principle of free speech must make their point by supporting it for some extreme cause.

McCoul’s dismissal happened after a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/19/texas-a-m-welsh-firing-professor-gender-mccoul/\">student secretly filmed video</a> as the professor taught a class and discussed a <a href=\"https://www.scholastic.ca/our-books/book/jude-saves-the-world-9781338855876\">children’s book</a> that includes the image of a purple “<a href=\"https://libguides.madisoncollege.edu/LGBTQ/gender\">gender unicorn</a>,” a cartoon image that is sometimes used to teach about gender identity. </p>\n\n<p>The student questioned whether it was “legal” to be teaching about gender identity, given President Donald Trump’s January 2025 executive order – which is not legally binding – that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/\">said there are only two genders</a>, male and female.</p>\n\n<p>The video went viral, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/08/texas-am-video-professor-student-gender-identity-content/\">triggering backlash</a> from Republican lawmakers who <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/10/texas-am-professor-fired-melissa-mccoul-statement/\">called for McCoul to be fired</a> and praised the fact that the school also demoted the College of Arts and Science’s dean and revoked administrative duties from a department head. </p>\n\n<p>Texas A&amp;M officials <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/19/texas-a-m-welsh-firing-professor-gender-mccoul/\">have said</a> that McCoul was fired because her course content was not consistent with the published course description.

The Cold War offers an example of another politically contentious time in American history when people questioned if and how politics should influence what gets taught in the classroom – and tried to restrict what teachers say. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large grassy and concrete space is seen with a water tower behind it and a person riding their bike, while another one walks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693001/original/file-20250926-64-95kr40.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The public university Texas A&amp;M, seen here in August 2023, is the site of a controversial freedom of speech and academic repression case.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/speech-bubble-parachute-attached-with-string-royalty-free-illustration/2218141241?phrase=freedom%20of%20speech%20restriction&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Educators under suspicion in the McCarthy era</h2>\n\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Cold-War\">the Cold War</a> – a period of geopolitical tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that came after World War II and lasted until 1991 – fears of communist infiltration spread widely across American society, including the country’s schools. </p>\n\n<p>One particularly contentious period was in the late 1940s and 1950s, during what is often referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/McCarthyism\">McCarthy era</a>. The era is named after Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-McCarthy\">Sen. Joseph McCarthy</a>, a Republican who led the charge on accusing government employees and others – often without evidence – of being communists. </p>\n\n<p>Beginning in the late 1940s, local school boards, state legislatures and Congress <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/teachers-schools-dei-communism/681906/\">launched investigations</a> into <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/teachers-schools-dei-communism/681906/\">teachers and professors</a> across the country accused of harboring communist sympathies. This often led to the teachers being blacklisted and fired. </p>\n\n<p>More than 20 states <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5224/masshistrevi.12.1.0035\">passed loyalty oath laws</a> requiring public employees, including educators, to swear that they were not members of the Communist Party or affiliated groups.</p>\n\n<p>In California, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.cschs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/History-Resources-Caragozian-UCs-Loyalty-Oath-Fight-3-10-23.pdf\">1950 Levering Act</a> mandated a loyalty oath for all state employees, including professors at public universities. Some employees refused to sign the oath, and 31 University of California professors <a href=\"https://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2022/03/21/i-take-this-obligation-freely-recalling-uc-berkeleys-loyalty-oath-controversy/\">were fired</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And in New York, the <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4961&amp;context=lawreview\">Feinberg Law</a>, approved in 1949, authorized school districts to fire teachers who were members of “subversive organizations.” More than 250 educators were fired or forced to resign under the Feinberg Law and related anti-subversion policies between 1948 and 1953.</p>\n\n<p>These laws had a chilling impact on academic life and learning. </p>\n\n<p>Faculty, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/369058\">including those who were not under investigation</a>, and students alike avoided discussing controversial topics, such as labor organizing and civil rights, in the classroom. </p>\n\n<p>This pervasive climate of censorship also made it <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/teachers-schools-dei-communism/681906/\">challenging for educators</a> to fully engage students in critical, meaningful learning.</p>\n\n<h2>The Supreme Court steps in</h2>\n\n<p>By the mid-1950s, questions about the constitutionality of these laws – and the extent of professors’ academic freedom and <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\">First Amendment right</a> to freedom of speech – reached the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p>In one such case, 1957’s <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/354/234/\">Sweezy v. New Hampshire</a>, Louis C. Weyman, the New Hampshire attorney general, questioned Paul Sweezy, a Marxist economist, about the content of a university lecture he delivered at the University of New Hampshire. </p>\n\n<p>Weyman <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/354/234?\">wanted to determine</a> whether Sweezy had advocated for Marxism or said that socialism was inevitable in the country. Sweezy refused to answer Weyman’s questions, citing his constitutional rights. The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep354/usrep354234/usrep354234.pdf\">ruled in Sweezy’s favor</a>, emphasizing the importance of academic freedom and the constitutional limits on state interference in university teaching.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court also considered another case, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/385/589/\">Keyishian v. Board of Regents</a>, in 1967. With the Cold War still ongoing, this case challenged New York’s Feinberg Law, which required educators to disavow membership in communist organizations. </p>\n\n<p>In striking down the law, the <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/385/589/\">court declared</a> that academic freedom is “a special concern of the First Amendment.” The ruling emphasized that vague or broad restrictions on what teachers can say or believe create an unconstitutional, “chilling effect” on the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>While these cases did not remove all political pressures on what teachers could discuss in class, they set significant constitutional limits on state efforts to regulate classroom speech, particularly at public institutions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693006/original/file-20250926-56-s1ux7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a black-and-white photo wears glasses and holds up papers toward a microphone.

Today, debates often involve conservative critiques of how topics such as gender identity, race and other cultural issues — sometimes grouped under the term “woke” — are addressed in schools and society. </p>\n\n<p>Second, in the 1950s and ‘60s, external pressures on academic freedom often came in the form of legal mandates. </p>\n\n<p>Today, the political landscape in academia is more complex and fast-paced, with pressures emanating from both the public and <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/trumps-higher-education-crackdown-visa-revocations-dei-bans-lawsuits-and-funding-cuts\">federal government</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/educators-fired-after-charlie-kirk-posts-allege-free/story?id=125853309\">Viral outrage</a>, administrative investigations and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/16/survey-provosts-focused-funding-cuts-academic\">threats to cut state or federal funding</a> to schools can all contribute to an intensifying climate of fear of retribution that constrains educators’ ability to teach freely. </p>\n\n<p>Despite these differences, the underlying dynamic between the two time periods is similar – in both cases, political polarization intensifies public scrutiny of educators.</p>\n\n<p>Like loyalty oaths in the 1950s, today’s political controversies create a climate in which many teachers feel pressure to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/01/09/watching-their-words-us-faculty-say-theyre-self\">avoid contentious topics altogether</a>. Even when no laws are passed, the possibility of complaints, investigations or firings can <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/why-teachers-self-censor\">shape classroom choices</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Just as Sweezy and Keyishian defined the boundaries of state power in the 1950s and ‘60s, potential legal challenges like <a href=\"https://wtaw.com/fired-texas-am-professor-appeals-her-termination/\">the appeal</a> from the fired Texas A&amp;M professor may eventually lead to court rulings that clarify how people’s First Amendment protections apply in today’s disputes over curriculum and teaching. </p>\n\n<p>Whether these foundational protections will endure under the Supreme Court’s current and future makeup remains an open question.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265554/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Laura Gail Miller does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Hundreds of generals and admirals converged on Quantico, Virginia, on Sept. 30, 2025, after being summoned from across the globe by their boss, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, for a session that, as expected, covered what Hegseth often describes as the “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/26/hegseth-generals-meeting-warrior-speech/\">warrior ethos</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Listening quietly, they heard <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/30/hegseth-military-meeting-trump-generals/\">Hegseth promise to make the military</a> “stronger, tougher, faster, fiercer and more powerful than it has ever been before,” and declare that he would fix “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BA5EwsR_rI\">decades of decay</a>” in the military.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/30/trump-quantico-military-generals/\">President Donald Trump spoke for more than an hour</a> in a political speech that derided presidents who came before him. He asserted that “political correctness” would be banished from the military.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting came soon after Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restoring-the-united-states-department-of-war/\">Sept. 5 executive order</a> renaming the Department of Defense the “Department of War.” With that change, Trump reverted the department to a name not used since the 1940s. </p>\n\n<p>The change represents far more than rebranding – it signals an escalation in the administration’s embrace of a militaristic mindset that, as long ago as 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/president-dwight-d-eisenhowers-farewell-address\">warned against in his farewell address</a>, and that the nation’s founders deliberately aimed to constrain. </p>\n\n<p>The timing of this name change feels particularly notable when considered alongside <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/us/navy-seal-north-korea-trump-2019.html\">recent reporting</a> revealing secret U.S. military operations. In 2019, a detachment of U.S. Navy SEALs crept ashore in North Korea on a mission to plant a listening device during high-stakes nuclear talks. The risks were enormous: Discovery could have sparked a hostage crisis or even war with a nuclear-armed foe. </p>\n\n<p>That such an operation was approved by Trump in his first term at all exemplifies an increasingly reckless militarism that has defined American foreign policy for decades. That militarism is the very subject of my book, “<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dying-by-the-sword-9780197581438?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Dying by the Sword</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Further, the name change was announced just days after Trump authorized a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/was-deadly-us-attack-venezuelan-vessel-legal-2025-09-04/\">U.S. military strike on a Venezuelan boat</a> that the administration claimed was carrying drug-laden cargo and linked to the Tren de Aragua cartel. The strike killed 11 people. The administration justified the killings by labeling them “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5487264-trump-caribbean-drug-strike/\">narcoterrorists</a>.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large cargo plane being unloaded by soldiers.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693484/original/file-20250929-56-hh8a7i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The U.S. has beefed up military exercises in Puerto Rico during a campaign in the Southern Caribbean against boats suspected of transporting illegal drugs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/air-force-service-members-work-to-unload-cargo-at-jos%C3%A9-news-photo/2234414394?adppopup=true\">Miguel J.

Just two years later, lawmakers amended the act, renaming the institution the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p>Officials disliked the “NME” acronym – which <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/department-defense-created?emci=ea11761d-a856-f011-8f7c-6045bdfe8e9c&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid=%7B%7BContactsEmailID%7D%7D\">sounded uncomfortably like “enemy”</a> – but the change was not only about appearances. </p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of World War II, U.S. leaders wanted to emphasize a defensive rather than aggressive military posture as they entered the Cold War, a decades-long standoff between the United States and Soviet Union defined by a nuclear arms race, ideological rivalry and proxy wars short of direct great-power conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The new emphasis also dovetailed with the new U.S. grand strategy in foreign affairs – <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/21042-long-telegram-original\">diplomat George F. Kennan’s containment strategy</a>, which aimed to prevent the expansion of Soviet power and communist ideology around the world. </p>\n\n<p>Kennan’s approach narrowly survived a push to a more aggressive “rollback” strategy of the Soviet Union from its occupation and oppression of central and eastern Europe. It evolved instead into a long game: a team effort to keep the adversary from expanding to enslave other peoples, leading to the adversary’s collapse and disintegration without risking World War III.</p>\n\n<p>On the ground, this meant fewer preparations for war and more emphasis on allies and intelligence, and foreign aid and trade, along with the projection of defensive strength. The hope was that shaping the environment rather than launching attacks would cause Moscow’s influence to wither. To make this strategy viable, the U.S. military itself had to be reorganized.</p>\n\n<p>In a 1949 address before Congress, President Harry S. Truman described the reorganization sparked by the 1947 legislation as a “unification” of the armed forces <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/50/special-message-congress-reorganization-national-military-establishment?\">that would bring efficiency and coordination</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But a deeper purpose was philosophical: to project America’s military power as defensive and protective, and for Truman, strengthening civilian oversight.</p>\n\n<p>The wisdom of this restraint is clearest in Eisenhower’s farewell address of January 1961. </p>\n\n<p>In less than 10 minutes, the former five-star general who had commanded Allied forces to victory in World War II cautioned Americans against the rise of a “military-industrial complex.” He acknowledged that the nation’s “arms must be mighty, ready for instant action,” but warned that “the potential for the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/president-dwight-d-eisenhowers-farewell-address\">disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”</a></p>\n\n<h2>Creating new enemies, destabilizing regions</h2>\n\n<p>The risky North Korean team mission by the Navy SEALs illustrates how America’s militaristic approach often produces the very dangers it aspires to deter. </p>\n\n<p>Rather than enhancing diplomacy, the operation risked derailing talks and escalating conflict. This is the central argument of my book: America’s now-reflexive reliance on armed force doesn’t make America great again or more secure. It makes the country less secure, by creating new enemies, destabilizing regions and diverting resources from the true foundations of security. </p>\n\n<p>It also makes the U.S less admired and respected. The State Department budget continues to be dwarfed by the Department of War’s budget, with the former <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dying-by-the-sword-9780197581438?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">never reaching more than 5.5%</a> of the latter. And the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, once the leading arm of U.S. soft power as quiet purveyor development aid around the world, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5451372/usaid-officially-shuts-down-and-merges-remaining-operations-with-state-department\">is now shuttered</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s Pentagon budget exceeds anything Eisenhower could have imagined. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHDgsh6WPyc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s farewell speech, delivered on Jan. 17, 1961, in which he warned against the establishment of a “military-industrial complex.”</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Trump’s rebranding of the Department of Defense into the Department of War signals a shift toward framing U.S. power primarily in terms of military force. Such a framing emphasizes the use of violence as the principal means of solving problems and equates hostility and aggression with leadership. </p>\n\n<p>Yet historical experience shows that military dominance alone has not translated into strategic success. That’s the mindset that lost the U.S. endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and failed in interventions in Libya and Syria – conflicts that altogether <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar\">cost trillions of dollars</a> and hundreds of thousands of lives while leaving the country less secure and eroding its international legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/president-dwight-d-eisenhowers-farewell-address\">Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry</a>,” Eisenhower said, can compel the proper balance between military power and peaceful goals. </p>\n\n<p>The very title of my and my co-author’s book comes from the Gospel of Matthew – Chapter 26, verse 52 – that “to live by the sword is to die by the sword.” Throughout modern history, true security has come from diplomacy, international law, economic development and investments in health care and education. Not from an imaginary “warrior ethos.”</p>\n\n<p>America, I would argue, doesn’t need a Department of War. It needs leaders who understand, as Eisenhower did, that living by the sword will doom us all in the end. Real security comes from the quiet power that builds legitimacy and lasting peace. The U.S. can choose again to embody those strengths, to lead not by fear but by example.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect the Pentagon meeting in Quantico, Virginia</em>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266213/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Monica Duffy Toft does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The reason they work isn’t because they are secret – they work because they are contextual.</p>\n\n<p>The informal protective communication shared in schools, churches, workplaces and other organizations can be communicated and trusted based on the common language and cultural understanding of those giving and receiving the information.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2017 when the MeToo hashtag went viral, people have been trying to create online whisper networks. Projects like the <a href=\"https://shittymediamenlist.wordpress.com/\">Shitty Media Men</a> list and the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/p/Are-We-Dating-The-Same-Guy-100087483682257/\">Are We Dating the Same Guy</a> are both examples of trying to build a larger warning system. The <a href=\"https://www.teaforwomen.com/\">Tea</a> app sells itself as a digital platform that gives women tools to protect themselves and others when dating men. </p>\n\n<p>However, important components of whisper networks get lost when they are moved to anonymous nationwide warning systems. </p>\n\n<p>I’m an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AMoWpMgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">organizational communications and gender scholar</a>. My research focuses on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1089335\">whisper networks</a> and how people use them to keep safe in organizations. When this idea moves to a digital platform, the information may still be useful, but it is harder for participants to gauge how reliable it is. </p>\n\n<h2>What makes whisper networks work</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1089335\">Whisper networks</a> form when there is an environment of shared risk. Their purpose is protective. In other words, the people in whisper networks do not share information for punitive reasons, but to protect each other and to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-870\">make sense of their experiences</a>. There is an unspoken expectation that the receiver of information will also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whisper-networks-thrive-when-women-lose-faith-in-formal-systems-of-reporting-sexual-harassment-196630\">share only with people they trust</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-870\">study of whisper networks</a>, participants talked about how they could assess the information they receive and give through personal interactions in their offices, congregations, schools and other organizations. They felt like they could measure the trustworthiness of the person sharing information and the trustworthiness of the people with whom they share information. </p>\n\n<p>They also talked about cues, including noticing how the person sharing information treats other people in the office and how they talk about other people when they aren’t around. This important component of whisper networks is difficult to translate to an app, even when the app claims to verify people as members. </p>\n\n<p>Women use coded messages and actions in whisper networks to figure out who is safe in any given room, who is in need of whisper network information, and when they decide that whisper network information is worth listening to. </p>\n\n<p>These protective messages tend to be shared either one on one or in small groups. Women know the information is reliable because of how it is shared and who shares it. For example, someone might say, “He is a little creepy toward the undergraduate women.” The person receiving the message uses the surrounding context codes to understand the seriousness of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Another person might say, “He makes people feel special and then uses information to be unprofessional.” Instead of a warning about actions, it is a warning about the process the harasser uses and what to watch out for. The person sharing the information wants the person they are protecting to understand the ways this perpetrator tends to move in relation to the people they work with. </p>\n\n<p>None of the language is specific, and it is largely coded so that the listener understands, and the person sharing doesn’t need to worry about the repercussions of sharing it. </p>\n\n<p>Interview participants told me that they usually share information in quiet conversations where they already trust the person they are talking to. </p>\n\n<p>When I asked participants about how they knew they were receiving whisper network information, they talked about how the person would lean in, drop to a different tone or volume, or how the vibe would change. It’s difficult to get any of those clues through an online platform. </p>\n\n<p>The risk of faulty information and misinterpretation goes up when information is shared on anonymous platforms or shared widely. When more specific stories are shared, it’s almost always in a trusted, private setting, not shared widely on an anonymous forum. When protective communication is broad, the network loses the very qualities that made it feel safe in the first place. Few of the nonverbal and social reputation signals exist on an app, and that makes the communication feel less trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Anonymous platforms can also create <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/25/us/tea-app-dating-privacy-cec\">potentially volatile situations</a>. Because people can post anonymously, there is more room for sloppiness, exaggeration and even defamation. These apps build on the myth that there is an individual solution and quick fix for sexual harassment and assault instead of <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-tea-app-problems-run-deeper-than-the-hacks-and-controversy\">acknowledging the underlying structural and cultural issues</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBcHMwA-MLs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In addition to being less effective than offline networks, whisper network apps and websites are vulnerable to hackers.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A different safety concern</h2>\n\n<p>Online platforms <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3686948\">offer users a limited understanding</a> of how their data is used and stored, so the user’s safety takes second place to the platform owners’ and investors’ financial incentives. These apps have largely been created by people who carry less risk and who are concerned with monetization, even if they also care about safety. The risks disproportionately affect those whose safety is already at risk. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to the issues of effectiveness and trust is the question of safety. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/02/nx-s1-5483886/tea-app-breach-hacked-whisper-networks\">Tea app has been in the news</a> because of two separate data breaches, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce87rer52k3o\">over 70,00 images that were leaked</a> to online message boards. Data included government-issued IDs, personal information and private messages. A separate breach <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/tea-apps-data-breach-gets-much-worse-exposing-over-a-million-private-messages/\">exposed direct messages</a> on the app.</p>\n\n<p>So while it’s conceivable that some online lists could be created for specific communities that share a common culture and language, no matter how good the intent is, it is unlikely that the creators of apps and websites are at the same risk of exposure as the people who use them. In addition, apps built for specific communities or communication styles would probably be significantly less profitable than those that are promoted nationally or worldwide and so are less likely to be built or sustained.</p>\n\n<p>All of this isn’t to say that apps aren’t useful and necessary. But based on my research, I don’t believe they provide the same safety and protection as in-person, organizational whisper networks.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265182/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carrie Ann Johnson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Although health agencies in the United States and other countries recommend chromium as a dietary requirement, eight decades of research have resulted in slim evidence that people derive any significant health benefits from this mineral. </p>\n\n<p>Why, then, did chromium come to be considered essential for human health?</p>\n\n<h2>What is an essential trace element?</h2>\n\n<p>To stay healthy, people need what are called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2022.110173\">essential trace elements</a> in their diet.

Iron, for example, is essential for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/blood-in-your-veins-is-not-blue-heres-why-its-always-red-97064\">carrying oxygen in your blood</a>, and many proteins – complex molecules that carry out all of the functions necessary for life – require iron to function properly. A deficiency of iron leads to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034\">anemia, a condition</a> that results in fatigue, weakness, headaches and brittle nails, among other symptoms. Iron supplements can help reverse these symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, biochemists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2024.04.015\">pinpointed exactly how</a> iron helps proteins perform essential chemical reactions, not just for humans but all living organisms. Researchers know not only that iron is essential but also why it is essential.</p>\n\n<h2>Little evidence for chromium’s benefits</h2>\n\n<p>However, the same cannot be said for chromium.</p>\n\n<p>Chromium deficiency – having little to no chromium in your body – is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582150/\">extremely rare</a>, and researchers have not identified any clearly defined disease caused by low chromium levels.</p>\n\n<p>Like all food, essential metals must be absorbed by your digestive system. However, the gut absorbs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110527872-009\">only about 1% of ingested chromium</a>. Other essential metals are absorbed more efficiently – for example, the average person absorbs <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c01833\">around 25% of certain forms of ingested iron</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, despite many studies, scientists have yet to find any protein that requires chromium to carry out its biological function. In fact, only <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi963154t\">one protein is known to bind chromium</a>, and this protein most likely helps your kidneys remove chromium from your blood. While some studies in people suggest chromium might be involved to some degree in regulating blood glucose levels, research on whether adding extra chromium to your body through supplements can substantially improve your body’s ability to break down and use sugar <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.27.11.2741\">has been inconclusive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, based on biochemistry, there is currently no evidence that humans, or other animals, actually require chromium for any particular function. </p>\n\n<h2>Flawed research in rats</h2>\n\n<p>So how did chromium come to be considered an essential trace metal?</p>\n\n<p>The idea that chromium might be essential for health stems from studies in the 1950s, a time when nutritionists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110527872-009\">knew very little</a> about what trace metals are required to maintain good health. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19601404243\">One influential study</a> involved feeding lab rats a diet that induced symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. Supplementing their diet with chromium seemed to cure the rats of Type 2 diabetes, and medical researchers were enticed by the suggestion that chromium might provide a treatment for this disease. Today’s widespread claims that chromium is important for regulating blood sugar can be traced to these experiments.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Chromium crystals in the shape of jagged chunks and as a cube\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chromium has many uses as a metal alloy, but not so much as a nutrient.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_crystals_and_1cm3_cube.jpg\">Alchemist-hp/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, these early experiments <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.117.255901\">were very flawed</a> by today’s standards. They lacked the statistical analyses needed to show that their results were not due to random chance. Furthermore, they lacked important controls, including measuring how much chromium was in the rats’ diet to start with.</p>\n\n<p>Later studies that were more rigorously designed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2024.127482\">provided ambiguous results</a>. While some found that rats fed chromium supplements controlled their blood sugar slightly better than rats raised on a chromium-free diet, others found no significant differences. But what was clear was that rats raised on diets that excluded chromium were perfectly healthy.</p>\n\n<p>Experiments on people are much harder to control for than experiments on rats, and there are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2023.127338\">few well-designed clinical trials</a> investigating the effects of chromium on patients with diabetes. Just as with the rat studies, the results are ambiguous. If there is an effect, it is very small.  </p>\n\n<h2>Recommendations based on averages</h2>\n\n<p>Why, then, is there a recommended dietary intake for chromium despite its lack of documented health benefits?</p>\n\n<p>The idea that chromium is needed for health persists due in large part to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17226/10026\">2001 report</a> from the National Institute of Medicine’s Panel on Micronutrients. This panel of distinguished nutritional researchers and clinicians was formed to evaluate available research on human nutrition and set “adequate intake” levels of vitamins and minerals. Their recommendations form the basis of the recommended daily intake labels found on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nutrition-facts-labels-have-a-complicated-legacy-a-historian-explains-the-science-and-politics-of-translating-food-into-information-231894\">food and vitamin packaging</a> and the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx\">National Institutes of Health guidelines for clinicians</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite acknowledging the lack of research demonstrating clear-cut health benefits for chromium, the panel still recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet. This recommendation was not based on science but rather on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17226/10026\">previous estimates</a> of how much chromium adult Americans already ingest each day. Notably, much of this chromium is leached from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.117.255901\">stainless steel cookware and food processing equipment</a>, rather than coming from our food.</p>\n\n<p>So, while there may not be <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Chromium-HealthProfessional/#h14\">confirmed health risks</a> from taking chromium supplements, there’s probably no benefit either.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252867/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Neil Marsh receives funding from the NIH and NSF. </span></em></p>",

Nelson, a former heart surgeon and longtime church leader, was 93 years old when he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/16/578311260/mormon-church-names-russell-m-nelson-as-new-leader\">became president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in 2018. But anyone who assumed that his tenure would be uneventful, due to his advanced years, was quickly proved wrong. Visiting South America that year, he <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/2018-year-in-review-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints/article/how-did-the-church-change-2018\">told members to buckle up</a>: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aYxOihyOBCw\">Eat your vitamin pills</a>. Get your rest. It’s going to be exciting.”</p>\n\n<p>Nelson, <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-russell-m-nelson-memorial\">who died on Sept. 27, 2025</a>, at age 101, proved a consequential reformer: an energetic leader who <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/2020/12/30/23217862/president-nelson-announcements-changes-church-prophet/\">streamlined bureaucracy</a>, took steps toward <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/10/02/major-change-latter-day/\">gender equity</a> and ended the church’s <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/2018/5/8/23221560/church-to-end-relationship-with-scouting-announces-new-activity-program-for-children-and-youth/\">century-long relationship with the Boy Scouts</a>, while reaffirming its opposition to LGBTQ+ relationships <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/latterday-saints-mormons-lgbtq-transgender-restrictions-ffac6b05f2f2190c33da184093061220\">and identities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>He steered the church unapologetically through storms of public scrutiny, including accusations that the church had concealed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011\">the value of its investments</a>. For the faithful, Nelson represented <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2018/05/saturday-morning-session/the-prophet-of-god?lang=eng\">God’s mouthpiece on Earth</a>. The church considers each president to be a “<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/prophets?lang=eng\">prophet, seer, and revelator</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Yet one of his initiatives made an impact that rippled far beyond the church. In 2018, he surprised observers by declaring the use of the word “Mormon” <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/the-correct-name-of-the-church?lang=eng\">a “major victory for Satan</a>,” insisting on the use of the church’s full name. Individuals were to be recognized <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/style-guide\">by their institutional affiliation</a>, as “members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”</p>\n\n<p>The name of the church was given by God, and shortening it erases “all that Jesus Christ did for us,” Nelson argued. Yet adherents have long self-identified as Mormons, so the rebrand <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2022/07/14/jana-riess-oh-now-i-get-it/\">felt like a novelty</a> to some members.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://religion.arizona.edu/people/krsmith2\">a university lecturer</a> teaching courses on American religion and Mormonism, I was one of many who wrestled with this change in terminology – and saw the challenges it created for my students and colleagues. For almost two centuries, the word “Mormon” has framed how Americans think about and discuss this faith.</p>\n\n<h2>Birth of a church</h2>\n\n<p>The name Mormon comes from the title of <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng\">the Book of Mormon</a>, a religious text unique to the faith. Founder Joseph Smith, who organized the church in 1830, believed he had been instructed by God to restore Jesus’ true church. He claimed that an angel had led him to uncover and translate ancient gold plates that detailed the religious history of an ancient civilization in the Americas, founded by Israelites who fled Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An old book open to the first page.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545090/original/file-20230828-298727-jel5ym.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An 1841 edition of the Book of Mormon, on display in the museum at the Springs Preserve in Las Vegas.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1841_Book_of_Mormon_open_to_title_page.jpg\">Prosfilaes/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Early critics mockingly attached the word Mormon to the movement, but Smith insisted that in the book’s original language, <a href=\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/1988/10/22/23263467/name-mormon-literally-means-more-good\">the word meant “literally, ‘more good</a>.’” By the time Smith was killed by a mob in Illinois in 1844, his followers had embraced the word.</p>\n\n<p>After Smith’s death, Mormons split into different factions, with the largest group traveling by foot and wagon to the far American West.

In 1903, high-ranking church official Reed Smoot was elected to the U.S. Senate, which provoked national outcry and <a href=\"https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/4012-the-reed-smoot-hearings\">led to Senate hearings</a> that lasted until 1907. The hearings substantiated charges that the practice of polygamy persisted but exonerated Smoot as an individual. As Smoot argued, Mormons were independent of the institutional church and thus trustworthy Americans. He convinced his fellow senators that if the church’s teachings came into conflict with his conscience or oath of office, then, as a Mormon, he would uphold the latter.  </p>\n\n<p>Following Smoot’s lead, the church <a href=\"https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/4012-the-reed-smoot-hearings\">embraced the trappings of American patriotism</a> and doubled down against plural marriage. These moves won the Latter-day Saints powerful political allies, including Theodore Roosevelt, who disliked the institutional church but viewed Mormons themselves as <a href=\"https://uofupress.lib.utah.edu/frontier-religion/\">intensely moral and patriotic</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Meet the Mormons’</h2>\n\n<p>Ab Jenkins, <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/land-speed-records/ab-jenkins-the-record-breaking-god-fearing-mayor-who-made-bonneville-capital-of-speed/\">a race car driver</a> whose records made him an international celebrity in the 1930s, capitalized on this new image of Mormon individuality and wholesomeness.

By 1991, public opinion of Mormons <a href=\"https://rsc.byu.edu/eye-faith/why-mormon-olympics-didnt-happen#_note-7\">had fallen dramatically</a>, with 37% of Americans viewing them unfavorably – and leaders decided that another rebrand was in order.</p>\n\n<p>The previous year, senior leader Gordon B. Hinckley had admonished members to make the word Mormon “<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1990/10/mormon-should-mean-more-good?lang=eng\">shine with added luster</a>.” When he became president in 1995, Hinckley worked to reframe how the public saw Mormons, arguing on the “60 Minutes” TV show <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-interview-with-gordon-hinckley/\">that Mormons were “not a weird people</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002 pushed Mormonism into the national spotlight, and that same year, the church launched its major website, Mormon.org, with stories and headlines liberally using the term “Mormon.” <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5840/asrr201932658\">A media campaign</a> followed a decade later, featuring prominent members declaring, “I’m a Mormon.” Ordinary members were then encouraged to upload their own “I’m a Mormon” profiles to this website and share them on their own social media accounts.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A tall building with an image of a woman figure skating projected on it, next to church steeples and a snow-covered mountain.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/545086/original/file-20230828-254480-ox0lhd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Latter-day Saints temple in downtown Salt Lake City, center, as an Olympic banner drapes the church office building next door during the 2002 Games.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/downtown-salt-lake-city-is-bathed-in-the-evening-sunlight-news-photo/1144218916?adppopup=true\">George Frey/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Mitt Romney’s Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election and the popularity of the satirical “Book of Mormon” musical pushed Mormons again <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/the-mormon-moment-072361\">into the national spotlight</a>. In 2014, the church produced a documentary titled “Meet the Mormons,” shown in theaters across the U.S., which apostle Jefferey R. Holland explained was to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_5z1K2Ryx0\">show people what we’re really like</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In 2017, a Pew Research Center survey’s “feeling thermometer” found public opinion of Mormons to have risen to the “<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/\">somewhat warmer</a>” rating of 54, a 6-point increase from 2014.</p>\n\n<h2>‘More good’?</h2>\n\n<p>That said, the church’s relationship to the word Mormon has always been complex. As far back as 1990, Nelson was already warning fellow Latter-day Saints that Mormon was “<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1990/04/thus-shall-my-church-be-called?lang=eng\">not an appropriate alternative</a>” for the church’s full name. During the 2002 Olympics, the church advised media that <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/blog/using-the-term-mormon-\">the nickname was acceptable for individuals</a> but not to refer to the institution itself.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I would argue the church has used the word Mormon to improve public opinion for more than a century. Part of this branding downplayed popular fears about the church and its influence – allowing outsiders to develop favorable views toward Mormons, even if they disliked the institution itself. </p>\n\n<p>In March 2023, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2023/03/15/americans-feel-more-positive-than-negative-about-jews-mainline-protestants-catholics//\">a Pew Research poll</a> reported a low point in public opinion of Mormons, falling for the first time below every other measured group. A quarter of Americans held “unfavorable views of Mormons,” while only 15% held “favorable” ones. </p>\n\n<p>A month later, Nelson pleaded with members <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng\">to be peacemakers</a>, lamenting that “many people seem to believe that it is completely acceptable to condemn, malign and vilify anyone who does not agree with them.” Nationally, intense polarization and violence have continued since then – including a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/us/michigan-mormon-church-shooting-fire.html\">horrific attack in Michigan on a Latter-day Saints church building</a> on Sept. 28, 2025, just one day after Nelson’s death. </p>\n\n<p>“Mormon” has been an important term in engaging those outside the faith, particularly in countering negative perceptions. Whether or not the word disappears, what may matter more for Nelson’s legacy is whether people outside the church associate it with “more good” – both institutionally and individually. </p>\n\n<p><em>This is an updated version of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-russell-m-nelson-turns-100-a-look-back-at-one-of-the-words-that-will-define-his-legacy-and-the-controversial-terms-200-year-history-207190\">an article</a> originally published on Sept. 5, 2024.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266229/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Konden Smith Hansen does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But given that all previous U.S.-backed attempts have to date failed, there is reason for skepticism. The Conversation turned to <a href=\"https://kroc.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/asher-kaufman/\">Asher Kaufman</a>, an expert on the modern Middle East and professor of peace studies at the University of Notre Dame, to explain what is different about this plan – and how it might fare.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What are the main points of the new plan?</h2>\n\n<p>The plan outlined by Trump in the presence of Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">consists of 20 points</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If accepted by Israel and Hamas, it would see the full withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip in three stages. </p>\n\n<p>The first stage would be dependent on the release of the remaining 48 hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, 20 of whom are believed to be alive. At the same time, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life in prison, as well as 1,700 Gazans arrested after Oct. 7.</p>\n\n<p>This stage would also see humanitarian aid flow immediately to the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/09/1165876\">desperate population in Gaza</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stage two would see Gaza governed by a temporary transitional body consisting of a technocratic, apolitical committee composed of Palestinians and international members.</p>\n\n<p>The committee would be overseen by a “board of peace” headed by Trump and other heads of state, including former <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/tony-blair-benjamin-netanyahu-prime-minister-israeli-hamas-b2836087.html\">U.K Prime Minister Tony Blair</a>. This board would also oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and its economic development. </p>\n\n<p>Hamas’ members would be given amnesty if they laid down their arms, but would also have to agree – along with other members of militant Palestinian factions – to not have any role in the governance of Gaza. </p>\n\n<p>A new military body to be called the International Stabilization Force would be established and deployed in the Gaza Strip. The plan calls for it to be composed of Arab and international partners. </p>\n\n<p>Only then would the Israeli military withdraw completely from Gaza, at which point the post-war Gaza plan would turn to economic redevelopment. </p>\n\n<h2>How does this differ from past US-backed plans?</h2>\n\n<p>The portions of the plan that include Israeli withdrawal, the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the provision of mass humanitarian aid to Gaza are similar to past agreements, including the last one that collapsed after Israel <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/18/why-did-israel-break-the-ceasefire-in-gaza\">violated its terms in March 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But there are new parts. These include the creation of the board of peace and the International Stabilization Force.</p>\n\n<p>The former gives concrete structure to Trump’s older ideas to develop the Gaza Strip as <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-includes-real-estate-plan-to-develop-gaza-in-peace-deal/\">a real estate venture</a>; the latter provides a framework for an international military force that would police the strip for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>The plan also mentions a long-term horizon for self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state – a point not raised in previous proposals, which mainly focused on ending the war in Gaza but neglected to include a longer-term pathway to statehood.</p>\n\n<h2>What would post-Gaza look like under this plan?</h2>\n\n<p>Trump sees the Gaza Strip as a real estate development opportunity – he has said as much in the past, and again talked on Sept. 29 of the opportunities of the coastline of Gaza. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two people look through a gap in the wall as a plume of smoke rises in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693494/original/file-20250929-56-pmpnpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Smoke rises from the area targeted by Israeli forces in Gaza City, Gaza on Sept. 27, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/smoke-rises-from-the-area-targeted-by-israeli-forces-in-news-photo/2237321631?adppopup=true\">Khames Alrefi/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As such, his “vision of peace” is designed mainly through an economic-development lens. </p>\n\n<p>The plan envisions a reconstructed strip supported <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/egypt-qatar-deliver-trump-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-to-hamas/3702731\">principally by regional players</a> that could stabilize the region and provide in the short term humanitarian relief and in the long term economic opportunities to Gazans.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration and Israel hope to have not only a Hamas-free Gaza but a depoliticized Gazan population in its entirety.</p>\n\n<h2>With no role for Hamas, who will represent Palestinians in Gaza?</h2>\n\n<p>It is not clear from the plan who will represent Palestinians. But reading between the lines, one can see the possibility of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-palestinian-authority-is-facing-a-legitimacy-crisis-can-it-be-reformed-to-govern-a-palestinian-state-263042\">revamped version of the Palestinian Authority</a>, the body that nominally governs parts of the West Bank, that could take the role of “Palestinian technocrats.” Point nine of the plan suggests that the Palestinian Authority could have a role in the future of Gaza after the Palestinian Authority “has completed its reform program,” but it does not say what this reform program entails.</p>\n\n<p>The plan also suggests that Palestinian police forces would be trained and supervised by the International Stabilization Force and stationed in the Gaza Strip. That also hints to the possibility that the Palestinian Authority’s police – which has long been accused by Palestinians of working in concert with the Israelis to provide security in the West Bank – could take up this role. </p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu has <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/netanyahu-greenlights-trump-s-gaza-plan-but-doubts-role-for-palestinian-authority/3702700\">long resisted considering the Palestinian Authority</a> as a viable body to govern Gaza in the “day after” the war. </p>\n\n<p>So if this plan goes into effect, the question of who makes up the Palestinian technocratic administration might certainly be one of the main stumbling blocks. </p>\n\n<h2>What are the chances of the plan being accepted?</h2>\n\n<p>There are two main barriers. </p>\n\n<p>In Israel, Netanyahu will need to get the approval of the far-right members of his government, who in the past have <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/far-right-settlers-urge-netanyahu-to-defy-us-and-annex-west-bank-not-end-gaza-war/\">resisted anything short of a continuation of the war</a> and the final takeover of the Gaza Strip by Israel. Netanyahu knows that his political future is dependent on keeping far-right members of his coalition on board – and that dynamic has <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/why-did-netanyahu-end-the-gaza-ceasefire\">undone past pushes for the end of the war</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Hamas, if this agreement is realized, it would mean the end of its military and political presence in the Gaza Strip. </p>\n\n<p>As such, the political and militant body – which has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv7w3gdy2o\">governed the territory since June 2007</a> – will need to be in a desperate situation to accept the terms. Or perhaps, Hamas may finally be attuned to the desperate plight of Gazans and respond to it.</p>\n\n<p>The plan, as worded, gives them little to hold on to as an achievement after Hamas sparked two years of war on Oct. 7, 2023, with unbearable sacrifices for Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>It is not far-fetched to think that Netanyahu is supporting Trump’s plan knowing that chances of its realization are very slim. In the last two years, Netanyahu has demonstrated that he is mainly motivated by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/magazine/benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-war.html\">his own political survival</a> and he will not take any step that would jeopardize it. </p>\n\n<p>By accepting the plan, he demonstrates his alliance with the American president. It could also win Netanyahu valuable political capital in Israel: allowing him to present himself as willing to end the war, but safe in the knowledge that it will likely be rejected by Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>Given the fact that the plan has no concrete timeline, particularly in relation to Israel’s staged withdrawal, it also buys him valuable political time. It could allow Netanyahu to place himself in a better position domestically, with national <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/israel-opposition-knesset-election-palestinian-parties/\">elections scheduled for October 2026</a>. If Netanyahu sees that public opinion shifts in his favor he could even move forward with early elections, as he often did in the past, to capitalize on the moment.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266341/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Asher Kaufman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Released in May, Zeldin’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-05/fy-2026-epa-bib.pdf#page=21\">budget proposal for the fiscal year starting October 2025</a> proposed to cut 1,274 full-time-equivalent employee positions from a total of 14,130 in the year ending Sept. 30, 2025 – a 9% drop.</p>\n\n<p>A July 18, 2025, press release from the EPA said the agency had already <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-reduction-force-reorganization-efforts-save-taxpayers-nearly-three\">cut 23% of its personnel</a>, terminating the employment of 3,707 of 16,155 employees. Using employees – the number of people – rather than full-time equivalents makes these numbers difficult to compare directly with EPA’s budget proposals.</p>\n\n<p>Combining EPA data on staffing changes with conservative estimates of the pending cuts, the initiative has calculated that <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/publication/burning-down-the-epa-documenting-the-second-trump-administrations-historic-assault/\">25% of EPA staff</a> are already out of the agency.</p>\n\n<p>That calculation does not include other announced cuts, including a third round of deferred resignations taking effect at the end of September 2025 and December 2025. Those cuts may see the departure of similar numbers of full-time equivalents as in the past two rounds – approximately 500 and 1,500.</p>\n\n<p>The agency has also <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/leaked-epa-layoff-plan-would-slash-science-office/\">reportedly planned to be cutting as much as two-thirds</a> of research staff. </p>\n\n<p>With those departure figures included, the initiative estimates that approximately 33% of staffers at the agency when Trump took office will be gone by the end of 2025. That would leave, at the start of 2026, an EPA staff numbering approximately 9,700 people, a level not seen since the last years of the Nixon and Ford administrations.</p>\n\n<p>These cuts are deeper than past efforts to shrink the size of the agency. In his first term, Trump <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Burning-Down-the-EPA.pdf#page=10\">proposed eliminating 21.4% of staff at the EPA</a>, though Congress made no significant changes to the agency’s staffing. The largest actual cut to EPA staffing was under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s: He advocated for a 17.3% drop in staffing, <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Burning-Down-the-EPA.pdf\">although Congress held the cuts to 10%</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"yoUhV\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yoUhV/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Effects of past cuts</h2>\n\n<p>In the past, cuts to the EPA caused problems and were reversed – but it took years. </p>\n\n<p>The staffing and budget cuts that came during the first two years of the Reagan administration <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EPA-Under-Siege.pdf\">generated problems with meeting the agency’s responsibilities</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, rather than prosecute industry for polluting, Reagan’s EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch told business leaders she would ignore their violations of environmental laws. Remaining staff were <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2017/05/02/what-happened-when-industry-friendly-epa-leader-80s-went-too-far\">convinced that working on enforcement cases would be a “black mark</a>” on their records. </p>\n\n<p>Another top political appointee at Reagan’s EPA, Rita Lavelle, who headed the Superfund effort to clean up toxic sites, faced prison time for her official acts. She was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-04-20-mn-21740-story.html\">convicted of perjury and obstructing a congressional investigation</a> because she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html\">lied about her ties to a former employer</a> who had polluted the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a Superfund site near Riverside, California.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person holds a clear jar of liquid while sitting on the ground in an area covered by rocks and dirt.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692968/original/file-20250925-56-8hu82h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=508&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A man holds a jar of contaminated water from the stream flowing out of the Stringfellow Acid Pits in California in February 1983.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-unidentified-man-holds-a-jar-of-contaminated-water-from-news-photo/1248635084\">Bill Nation/Sygma via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the wake of the scandal, Lavelle was fired and Gorsuch and more than a dozen other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html\">political appointees resigned</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In a later report on the issue, Congress accused Gorsuch, Lavelle and others of <a href=\"https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007605714\">poor job performance</a>, noting that after four years of Superfund work, “only six of the 546 … of the most hazardous sites in the Nation have been cleaned up.” The Stringfellow site, a focus of the investigation, was “threatening the health and safety of 500,000 people,” the report noted.</p>\n\n<p>With anger over the scandals from both Americans and Congress, Reagan <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EPA-Under-Siege.pdf#page=19\">reversed course</a> and spent the remaining six years of his presidency building the EPA back up in both staffing and budget. <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Burning-Down-the-EPA.pdf#page=31\">Staffing, for example, increased</a> from a low of 10,481 full-time-equivalent employees in 1982 to 15,130 in 1989.

      "content": "<p>Not long after U.S. housing prices reached a record high this summer – the median existing home went for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477513/home-prices-hit-an-all-time-high-while-sales-are-down-how-come\">US$435,000 in June</a> – President Donald Trump said that he was <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/trump-says-hes-considering-eliminating-tax-on-home-sales-00467915\">considering a plan</a> to make home sales tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters of the idea, introduced by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/congressional-record-index/119th-congress/1st-session/no-tax-on-home-sales-act/1953625\">No Tax on Home Sales Act</a> in July, say it would benefit working families by eliminating all taxes on the sales of family homes.</p>\n\n<p>But most Americans who sell their homes already do so tax-free. And the households that would gain most under Trump’s proposals are those with the most valuable real estate.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://law.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=beverly-moran\">legal scholar</a> who studies how taxes affect racial and economic inequality, I see this proposal as part of a familiar pattern: measures advertised as relief for ordinary families that mostly benefit the well-off.</p>\n\n<h2>Most families already sell their homes tax-free</h2>\n\n<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-26-internal-revenue-code/26-usc-sect-121/\">according to the Internal Revenue Code</a>, a single person pays no tax on the first $250,000 in gain from a home sale, while married people can exclude $500,000. All told, <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/capital-gains-2025/d.\">about 90% of home sales</a> generate less than $500,000 in gains, so the overwhelming majority of sellers already owe no tax.</p>\n\n<p>The minority who would see new benefits from the proposed tax change are those with more than $500,000 in appreciation – typically owners of <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/capital-gains-2025/#:%7E:text=Single%20family%20homes%20more%20likely,having%20gained%20at%20least%20$500%2C000.&amp;text=In%20comparison%2C%2015%25%20of%20townhouses,in%20value%20since%20last%20sold\">high-priced homes in hot real estate markets</a>. Yale’s Budget Lab estimated the average benefit for these tax-free sales was <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/who-would-benefit-eliminating-capital-gains-taxes-home-sales\">$100,000 per qualifying seller</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Homeownership itself isn’t equally distributed across the U.S. population. About <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\">44% of Black Americans</a> are homeowners, compared with 74% of white Americans. That racial gap has <a href=\"https://eyeonhousing.org/2024/02/homeownership-rates-by-race-and-ethnicity-3/\">only widened over the past 10 years</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/single-women-get-lower-returns-from-housing-investments\">single women</a> – particularly but not exclusively women of color – face additional barriers. </p>\n\n<h2>A broader trend of upward wealth transference</h2>\n\n<p>Though still just a proposal, the tax-free home sales bill is part of a broader set of Republican tax plans that would have <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/regressive-tax\">regressive effects</a> – that is, where the vast majority of benefits go to high-income people and very few to low-income people – under a <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-tax-deductions-for-working-americans-and-seniors\">pro-worker banner</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Trump floated the tax-free home sales idea less than three weeks after he signed a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions\">large package of tax and spending measures</a>  in July 2025. That bill generated <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/kff-health-tracking-poll-views-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/\">strong public criticism</a> because of its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/getattachment/1332c86f-04b9-4b89-a418-1df4804e7427/x-33-25.pdf\">tax savings for the rich</a> at the expense of <a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/07/22/medicaid-chip-and-affordable-care-act-marketplace-cuts-and-other-health-provisions-in-the-budget-reconciliation-law-explained/\">almost a trillion dollars</a> in cuts for federally funded <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2025/trump-big-beautiful-bill-your-taxes-cuts/\">health care for the poor and disabled</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The home sales idea follows the same script – and echoes the distributional pattern established by his <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/what-is-the-tcja\">2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>. That tax reform increased <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-2017-tax-cuts-expire-soon-study-shows-they-made-income-inequality-worse-and-especially-hurt-black-americans-233758\">racial wealth and income disparities</a> and provided <a href=\"https://inequality.org/article/trump-tax-cuts-inequality/\">80% of its benefits</a> to corporations and high-income individuals. In fact, my research shows that white households received <a href=\"https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RI_TCJA-Impact-on-Black-Taxpayers_Brief_062024.pdf\">more than twice as many tax cuts</a> as Black households from that law.</p>\n\n<p>The same dynamic plays out in this new tax-fueled housing policy. Eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales would primarily benefit the <a href=\"https://www.lendfriendmtg.com/learning-center/no-tax-on-home-sales\">29 million homeowners who already have substantial equity</a> – a group that skews heavily white, male and upper middle class. Meanwhile, America’s millions of renters, disproportionately people of color and women, would receive no benefit while potentially losing access to social programs Congress must cut to fund these tax breaks.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264959/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Beverly Moran is a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, and Paulus Endowment senior tax fellow at Boston College.</span></em></p>",

Women artists within the movement often drew on its dreamlike language to counter male surrealists’ idealized and objectifying portrayals of women, reclaiming their own agency and identity.</p>\n\n<p>The movement’s centennial will be celebrated during the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s “<a href=\"https://philamuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/dreamworld-surrealism\">Dreamworld: Surrealism at 100</a>” exhibition, which opens Nov. 8, 2025, and runs through Feb. 16, 2026.</p>\n\n<p>As an artist, writer and curator who focuses on <a href=\"https://wvu.academia.edu/SallyDeskins\">feminism in art history</a>, I’m excited to see Tanning’s “Birthday” displayed in Philadelphia alongside works by canonical male surrealists such as <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/1364-salvador-dali\">Salvador Dalí</a> and <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/joan-miro\">Joan Miró</a>. This juxtaposition invites viewers to reexamine surrealism through the contributions of women like Tanning, as well as <a href=\"https://nmwa.org/art/artists/leonora-carrington/\">Leonora Carrington</a> and perhaps <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/8317-remedios-varo\">Remedios Varo</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These women brought radical innovations to the movement. Their depictions of female experiences of <a href=\"https://www.culturedmag.com/article/2019/05/28/leonora-carrington/\">sexual awakening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clevelandart.org/art/2023.157\">domestic entrapment</a> and <a href=\"https://emuseum.vassar.edu/objects/4580/small-portrait\">psychic resistance</a> added new depth to the dreamscapes envisioned by their male contemporaries. </p>\n\n<h2>A steady, unseductive gaze</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C0%2C1080%2C1709&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Vertical oil painting of woman with fantastical creature at her feet in the foreground and a series of open doors in the background\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C0%2C1080%2C1709&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=950&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=950&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=950&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1194&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1194&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692532/original/file-20250923-56-1muj27.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1194&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘Birthday,’ painted by American surrealist Dorothea Tanning in 1942.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.dorotheatanning.org/life-and-work/view/63/\">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In “Birthday,” the artist paints herself bare-chested and wearing an elaborate skirt composed of flowing, vinelike forms that intertwine with female figures, evoking an organic world somewhere between vegetation and the sea. She stands tall in a corridor lined with doors that seem to recede endlessly. Is she trapped in domesticity, or do the doors represent infinite ways out? She stares off, seemingly at the painter, not the viewer. At her feet is a fantastical winged feline creature, its presence both companionable and uncanny.</p>\n\n<p>The composition has many hallmarks of surrealism, including dream logic – the strange, flowing and often illogical progression of images reflecting the unpredictable nature of dreams – metamorphosis and psychic ambiguity. Psychic ambiguity refers to an open-ended emotional or psychological meaning. It invites multiple interpretations and exudes the complexity of the subconscious.</p>\n\n<p>But what distinguishes “Birthday,” in my view, is its insistence on agency. </p>\n\n<p>Many surrealist artists cast women as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-women-surrealism-muses-masters\">muses or dream figures conjured for the male gaze</a>. Tanning, however, places herself at the center. Her steady, unseductive gaze confronts the viewer and demands recognition of her authorship. </p>\n\n<p>French writer and poet <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/768-andre-breton\">André Breton</a>’s 1924 “<a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andre-breton-manifesto-of-surrealism\">Manifesto of Surrealism</a>” urged artists to liberate thought from rational constraint. Breton aimed to access the unconscious through dream and <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism\">automatism, a surrealist technique</a> of creating art without conscious control, allowing spontaneous expression from the subconscious mind, free from rational thought or aesthetic rules.</p>\n\n<h2>A fascinating array of doors</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond her self-portrait, “Birthday” depicts a seemingly unending series of doorways. <a href=\"https://lapispress.com/content/viewing-room/24/artworks-1699-dorothea-tanning-birthday-1986/\">Tanning wrote</a> about <a href=\"https://www.dorotheatanning.org/life-and-work/view/63/\">taking inspiration from her New York apartment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I had been struck, one day, by a fascinating array of doors – hall, kitchen, bathroom, studio – crowded together, soliciting my attention with their antic planes, light, shadows, imminent openings and shuttings. From there it was an easy leap to a dream of countless doors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The “dream of countless doors” could represent the perpetual potential for change and renewal, or the ability to leave doors open for the imagination, or opportunities beyond domesticity for women.</p>\n\n<p>Tanning <a href=\"https://wherecreativityworks.com/dorothea-tanning-doors-to-womanhood/\">refused to be confined</a> by the label of “woman artist,” even as her work bore feminist depth. Nonetheless, her paintings modeled a form of self-determination that continues to resonate in the work of contemporary artists such as South African photographer <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/zanele-muholi\">Zanele Muholi</a> and American mixed-media artist <a href=\"https://mickalene.herokuapp.com/works\">Mickalene Thomas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, “Birthday” is not just a surrealist self-portrait; it is a threshold work. It situates the artist between known and unknown, rational and subconscious, constraint and liberation. For Tanning, it marked her own artistic birth. For viewers today, it marks a reminder that self-representation is not static but always in motion, transforming.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264958/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sally Jane Brown does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

He swore it would never happen again. <a href=\"https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/jacobs.html\">But as Jacobs later wrote</a>, “I knew that he would forget his promise.”</p>\n\n<p>Jacobs’ injuries took weeks to heal. Even after they did, she made sure nobody would forget what happened by including this harrowing moment in her 1861 autobiographical novel, “<a href=\"https://broadviewpress.com/product/incidents-in-the-life-of-a-slave-girl/#tab-description\">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself</a>,” one of the most important testimonies of captivity and survival ever written.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, we stumbled across the staircase during a visit to the <a href=\"https://mesda.org/\">Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts</a> in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, an institution known for its preeminent collections of paintings, pottery, furniture and fine exhibits on Southern artisans and early American craft.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Elderly mulatto woman sitting in a large wooden chair with exquisite carvings.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=853&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1072&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1072&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693135/original/file-20250926-56-298eep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1072&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A portrait of Harriet Jacobs taken in 1894, three years before her death.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://picryl.com/media/gilbert-studios-photograph-of-harriet-jacobs-cropped-168e82\">Journal of the Civil War Era</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>We’d gone there to see a table that belonged to a formerly enslaved writer named <a href=\"https://libraries.clemson.edu/press/books/before-the-war-and-after-the-union/\">Samuel “Aleckson” Williams</a>. But our attention was ultimately drawn several rooms away from the table, where we encountered woodwork – including the staircase Jacobs had written about – from the house where Norcom had enslaved her. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.clemson.edu/cah/about/facultybio.html?id=71\">As scholars of 19th-century U.S. literature</a> <a href=\"https://www.uscb.edu/academics/etais/english/faculty/mollie-barnes.html\">who regularly teach</a> Jacobs’ “Incidents,” we were stunned to realize that the staircase had survived.</p>\n\n<p>It caught us even more off guard because <a href=\"https://mountauburn.org/notable-residents/harriet-jacobs-1813-1897\">Jacobs’ life</a> has been receiving a lot of attention from scholars. For decades, Jacobs’ book was read as a work of fiction, if it was even remembered at all. But in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/projects/catalog/harriet-jacobs\">historians have recovered her papers</a> and confirmed a number of biographical details. In 2024, a narrative written by her brother, John Jacobs, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo213914021.html\">was republished</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For us, the experience highlighted the importance of these small, regional museums. The staircase hadn’t originally been salvaged due to its connection to Jacobs. But it had nonetheless been conserved and cared for, which allowed new meanings to slowly emerge.</p>\n\n<h2>A daring escape</h2>\n\n<p>In 1964, the Jacobs staircase – along with a door, a mantle and paneling – were taken from Norcom’s house in Edenton not because of their connection to Jacobs or her enslaver, but because of their significance to Revolutionary-era craftsmanship.</p>\n\n<p>We weren’t the first to realize the staircase’s connection to Jacobs. Roughly 15 years ago, curator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-leath-0a29129/\">Robert Leath</a> brought it to the attention of <a href=\"https://college.wfu.edu/college-news/teacher-scholar-legacies/teacher-scholar-legacies-anthony-parent/\">Anthony Parent</a>, a history professor at Wake Forest University. Parent publicized the story of these material objects through local outreach and <a href=\"https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/364180?ln=en\">some scholarship</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But like many histories that emerge from unexpected places, the story of the staircase hasn’t gained much traction in broader conversations among Jacobs scholars, much less in popular memory and national history.</p>\n\n<p>Across “Incidents,” Jacobs chronicles <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2923.html\">many moments of physical and psychological abuse</a>. But the assault on the stairs stands out among the many acts of terror she endured. </p>\n\n<p>“He had pitched me down stairs in a fit of passion,” she writes, “and the injury I received was so serious that I was unable to turn myself in bed for many days.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jacobs eventually fled her bondage and exchanged her life in captivity <a href=\"https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/norcom-james-sr\">under Norcom</a> for a life of <a href=\"https://www.ednc.org/a-walk-through-harriet-jacobs-edenton-and-her-journey-toward-freedom/\">quasi-freedom</a>: She spent seven years <a href=\"https://www.ednc.org/a-walk-through-harriet-jacobs-edenton-and-her-journey-toward-freedom/\">hiding in a nearby attic</a>. Eventually she made her way to the North, where she claimed her freedom and <a href=\"https://avidly.org/2019/11/18/harriet-jacobs-publisher-and-activist/\">published her book</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rediscovered in the 1970s, Jacobs’ story was so astonishing that some readers doubted its autobiographical accuracy. But historian <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/books/jean-fagan-yellin-dead.html\">Jean Yellin</a> was able to verify many aspects of her narrative, including the fact that she had hidden in an attic for seven years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TuhCzvp-RY\">Yellin’s revelations</a> of Jacobs’ <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/harrietjacobslif0000yell\">life</a> and <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9780807831311/the-harriet-jacobs-family-papers/\">work</a> – in addition to the harrowing experiences of other women held in captivity – helped change the way Americans have been able to learn about how women, both enslaved and free, survive coercion and sexual violence.</p>\n\n<h2>Hidden in plain sight</h2>\n\n<p>At the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, the staircase appears in between two separate galleries. On the wall along the steps to the first landing, a framed photograph of Harriet Jacobs and a framed copy of the first edition of “Incidents” hang. Though visitors are allowed to ascend the stairs, they don’t lead anywhere. In the next room are the mantel and wood paneling from the Norcom house. </p>\n\n<p>The museum’s website doesn’t include a write-up of the Jacobs staircase, nor does it showcase an image of the impressive installation, although it’s <a href=\"https://mesda.org/item/collections/passage/1686/\">cataloged with care</a> – and, thanks in part to Parent’s advocacy, generations of students have visited the museum to see what survives of Jacobs’ house. </p>\n\n<p>The museum staff recounted the story of the staircase to us in the course of a conversation about Williams. They, too, believe that the stories behind objects have a way of enduring, even as the importance and meaning of artifacts change over time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A sign reading 'Harriet Jacobs: fugitive slave, writer, and abolitionist.

These stories matter, even – and especially – when they played a role in the most <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5507221/trump-smithsonian-museums-woke\">violent</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5507221/trump-smithsonian-museums-woke\">chapters</a> in U.S. history.</p>\n\n<p>Jacobs’ staircase was valuable when it was acquired; it was understood then as an example of fine 18th-century craftsmanship, and that’s a story worth preserving and learning.

Instead, our experience simply demonstrates why museums, archives and libraries matter. These institutions require space to play the long game, in ways no one can anticipate, so they can continue doing what they do best: collect, preserve, document and curate. </p>\n\n<p>In doing so, they allow stories like Jacobs’ to unfold in remarkable and utterly unforeseeable ways.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263976/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Coyote feces is usually lumpy and larger than fox feces, which has pointy ends. Once it has weathered a bit, it’s easy to break open to find identifiable remains such as vole, rat and rabbit.

This protein acts as a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Together with other partner proteins, TOR controls how cells respond to nutrients, stress and environmental signals, thereby influencing major processes such as protein synthesis and immune function. Given its central role in these fundamental cellular activities, it is not surprising that cancer, metabolic disorders and age-related diseases are linked to the malfunction of TOR. </p>\n\n<p>Despite being so ubiquitous in science and medicine, how rapamycin was discovered has remained largely unknown to the public. Many in the field are aware that scientists from the pharmaceutical company Ayerst Research Laboratories <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i29/Rapamycins-Secrets-Unearthed.html\">isolated the molecule from a soil sample</a> containing the bacterium <em>Streptomyces hydroscopicus</em> in the mid-1970s. What is less well known is that this soil sample was collected as part of a Canadian-led mission to Rapa Nui in 1964, called the <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">Medical Expedition to Easter Island, or METEI</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a scientist who built my career around the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VMSDrYIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">effects of rapamycin on cells</a>, I felt compelled to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">understand and share the human story</a> underlying its origin.

Their goal was to study how an isolated population adapted to environmental stress, and they believed the planned construction of an international airport on Easter Island offered a unique opportunity. They presumed that the airport would result in increased outside contact with the island’s population, resulting in changes in their health and wellness.</p>\n\n<p>With funding from the World Health Organization and logistical support from the Royal Canadian Navy, METEI arrived in Rapa Nui in December 1964. Over the course of three months, the team conducted medical examinations on nearly all 1,000 island inhabitants, collecting biological samples and systematically surveying the island’s flora and fauna.</p>\n\n<p>It was as part of these efforts that Nogrady gathered over 200 soil samples, one of which ended up containing the rapamycin-producing <em>Streptomyces</em> strain of bacteria.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Poster of the word METEI written vertically between the back of two moai heads, with the inscription '1964-1965 RAPA NUI INA KA HOA (Don't give up the ship)'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">METEI logo.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">Georges Nogrady</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>It’s important to realize that the expedition’s primary objective was to study the Rapa Nui people as a sort of living laboratory. They encouraged participation through bribery by offering gifts, food and supplies, and through coercion by enlisting a long-serving Franciscan priest on the island to aid in recruitment. While the researchers’ intentions may have been honorable, it is nevertheless an example of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/medicalapartheid0000wash\">scientific colonialism</a>, where a team of white investigators choose to study a group of predominantly nonwhite subjects without their input, resulting in a power imbalance.</p>\n\n<p>There was an inherent bias in the inception of METEI. For one, the researchers assumed the Rapa Nui had been relatively isolated from the rest of the world when there was in fact a <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">long history of interactions</a> with countries outside the island, beginning with reports from the early 1700s through the late 1800s. </p>\n\n<p>METEI also assumed that the Rapa Nui were genetically homogeneous, ignoring the island’s complex history of migration, slavery and disease. For example, the modern population of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar2004\">Rapa Nui are mixed race</a>, from both Polynesian and South American ancestors. The population also included survivors of the African slave trade who were returned to the island and brought with them diseases, including smallpox.</p>\n\n<p>This miscalculation undermined one of METEI’s key research goals: to assess how genetics affect disease risk. While the team published a number of studies describing the different fauna associated with the Rapa Nui, their inability to develop a baseline is likely one reason why there was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">no follow-up study</a> following the completion of the airport on Easter Island in 1967.</p>\n\n<h2>Giving credit where it is due</h2>\n\n<p>Omissions in the origin stories of rapamycin reflect common ethical blind spots in how scientific discoveries are remembered.</p>\n\n<p>Georges Nogrady carried soil samples back from Rapa Nui, one of which eventually reached Ayerst Research Laboratories. There, Surendra Sehgal and his team isolated what was named rapamycin, ultimately bringing it to market in the late 1990s as the immunosuppressant Rapamune. While Sehgal’s persistence was key in keeping the project alive through corporate upheavals – going as far as to stash a culture at home – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">neither Nogrady nor the METEI was ever credited</a> in his landmark publications. </p>\n\n<p>Although rapamycin has generated billions of dollars in revenue, the Rapa Nui people have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">received no financial benefit</a> to date. This raises questions about Indigenous rights <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/patents-based-on-traditional-knowledge-are-often-biopiracy-a-new-international-treaty-will-finally-combat-this-231272\">and biopiracy</a>, which is the commercialization of Indigenous knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>Agreements like the <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/223428?v=pdf\">United Nations’s 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity</a> and the <a href=\"https://chr-observatories.uwazi.io/en/entity/cqf2kyyvc38/toc\">2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> aim to protect Indigenous claims to biological resources by encouraging countries to obtain consent and input from Indigenous people and provide redress for potential harms before starting projects. However, these principles were not in place during METEI’s time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up headshots of row of people wearing floral headdresses in a dim room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Rapa Nui have received little to no acknowledgment for their role in the discovery of rapamycin.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/EasterIsland-FireAmongtheMoai/54ca4d31ba2f47da8cfde3d2ff6d9fc2/photo\">Esteban Felix/AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">Some argue</a> that because the bacteria that produces rapamycin has since been found in other locations, Easter Island’s soil was not uniquely essential to the drug’s discovery. Moreover, because the islanders did not use rapamycin or even know about its presence on the island, some have countered that it is not a resource that can be “stolen.” </p>\n\n<p>However, the discovery of rapamycin on Rapa Nui set the foundation for all subsequent research and commercialization around the molecule, and this only happened because the people were the subjects of study. Formally recognizing and educating the public about the essential role the Rapa Nui played in the eventual discovery of rapamycin is key to compensating them for their contributions.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the broader pharmaceutical industry has begun to recognize the importance of fair compensation for Indigenous contributions. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15451/ec2012-8-1.3-1-25\">Some companies have pledged</a> to reinvest in communities where valuable natural products are sourced. However, for the Rapa Nui, pharmaceutical companies that have directly profited from rapamycin have not yet made such an acknowledgment.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, METEI is a story of both scientific triumph and social ambiguities. While the discovery of rapamycin has transformed medicine, the expedition’s impact on the Rapa Nui people is more complicated. I believe issues of biomedical consent, scientific colonialism and overlooked contributions highlight the need for a more critical examination and awareness of the legacy of breakthrough scientific discoveries.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250586/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ted Powers does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They were much safer than earlier light sources, and they made more activities, for both work and play, possible after the Sun went down.</p>\n\n<p>More than a century after its invention, illustrators still use a lit bulb to symbolize <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=light+bulb+idea+icon\">a great idea</a>. Credit typically goes to inventor and entrepreneur <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/how-eureka-moments-science-happen/\">Thomas Edison</a>, who created the first commercial light and power system in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://history.utk.edu/person/freeberg-ernest/\">a historian</a> and author of a book about <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307057/the-age-of-edison-by-ernest-freeberg/\">how electric lighting changed the U.S.</a>, I know that the actual story is more complicated and interesting. It shows that complex inventions are not created by a single genius, no matter how talented he or she may be, but by many creative minds and hands working on the same problem. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q4rQDN6Z4s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Thomas Edison didn’t invent the basic design of the incandescent light bulb, but he made it reliable and commercially viable.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Making light − and delivering it</h2>\n\n<p>In the 1870s, Edison raced against other inventors to find a way of producing light from electric current. Americans were keen to give up their gas and kerosene lamps for something that promised to be cleaner and safer. Candles offered little light and posed a fire hazard. Some customers in cities had brighter gas lamps, but they were expensive, hard to operate and polluted the air.  </p>\n\n<p>When Edison began working on the challenge, he learned from many other inventors’ ideas and failed experiments. They all were trying to figure out how to send a current through a thin carbon thread encased in glass, making it hot enough to glow without burning out. </p>\n\n<p>In England, for example, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Wilson-Swan\">chemist Joseph Swan</a> patented an incandescent bulb and lit his own house in 1878. Then in 1881, at a great <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/membership/library-and-archives/the-iet-archives/archives-highlights/paris-electrical-exhibition-1881\">exhibition on electricity in Paris</a>, Edison and several other inventors demonstrated their light bulbs. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s version proved to be the brightest and longest-lasting. In 1882 he connected it to a full working system that <a href=\"https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/edison-lit-manhattan\">lit up dozens of homes and offices</a> in downtown Manhattan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Edison’s bulb was just one piece of a much more complicated system that included <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history/landmarks/48-edison-jumbo-engine-driver-dynamo\">an efficient dynamo</a> – the powerful machine that generated electricity – plus a network of underground wires and new types of lamps. Edison also created the meter, a device that measured how much electricity each household used, so that he could tell how much to charge his customers. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s invention wasn’t just a science experiment – it was a commercial product that many people proved eager to buy.</p>\n\n<h2>Inventing an invention factory</h2>\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307057/the-age-of-edison-by-ernest-freeberg/\">show in my book</a>, Edison did not solve these many technical challenges on his own. </p>\n\n<p>At his farmhouse laboratory in <a href=\"https://www.menloparkmuseum.org/history\">Menlo Park, New Jersey</a>, Edison hired a team of skilled technicians and trained scientists, and he filled his lab with every possible tool and material. He liked to boast that he had only a fourth grade education, but he knew enough to recruit men who had the skills he lacked. Edison also convinced <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/J-P-Morgan\">banker J.P. Morgan</a> and other investors to provide financial backing to pay for his experiments and bring them to market. </p>\n\n<p>Historians often say that Edison’s greatest invention was this collaborative workshop, which he called an “invention factory.” It was capable of launching amazing new machines on a regular basis. Edison set the agenda for its work – a role that earned him the nickname “the wizard of Menlo Park.” </p>\n\n<p>Here was the beginning of what we now call “research and development” – the network of universities and laboratories that produce technological breakthroughs today, ranging from lifesaving vaccines to the internet, as well as many improvements in the electric lights we use now. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvPWA_zUc8&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Sparking an electric revolution</h2>\n\n<p>Many people found creative ways to use Edison’s light bulb. Factory owners and office managers installed electric light to <a href=\"https://stewartlighting.com/2024/03/29/how-light-bulbs-changed-the-world/\">extend the workday</a> past sunset. Others used it for <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/19thcent/consq19.htm\">fun purposes</a>, such as movie marquees, amusement parks, store windows, Christmas trees and evening baseball games. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/stagecraft/Stage-lighting\">Theater directors</a> and <a href=\"https://gamma-sci.com/2020/11/16/a-history-of-lighting-in-photography/\">photographers</a> adapted the light to their arts. Doctors used small bulbs to peer inside the body during surgery. Architects and city planners, sign-makers and deep-sea explorers adapted the new light for all kinds of specialized uses. Through their actions, humanity’s relationship to day and night was reinvented – often in ways that Edison never could have anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>Today people take for granted that they can have all the light they need at the flick of a switch. But that luxury requires a network of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeMbhk4Mmw&amp;t=72s\">power stations, transmission lines and utility poles</a>, managed by teams of trained engineers and electricians. To deliver it, electric power companies <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529785/the-power-brokers/\">grew into an industry</a> monitored by insurance companies and public utility regulators. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s first fragile light bulbs were just one early step in the electric revolution that has helped create today’s richly illuminated world.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

      "content": "<p>In Serbia, there is a word for a form of stubbornness that sees someone act out of spite or defiance rather than yield to the will of others: “<a href=\"https://belgradelanguageschool.com/14-untranslatable-serbian-words-and-phrases-to-master-serbian/\">inat</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s something Serbian President <a href=\"https://www.predsednik.rs/en/president/biography\">Aleksandar Vučić</a> is showing remarkable levels of right now.</p>\n\n<p>For almost a year, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2025)775906\">anti-government protests</a> have roiled the Balkan nation. They intensified over summer 2025, culminating in <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250816-serbia-police-use-tear-gas-clash-anti-government-protesters-belgrade\">angry clashes between students and police</a> in <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-student-protests-tear-gas-novi-sad/33523446.html\">August and September</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/09/22/serbia-protests-vucic-government-corruption/\">Vučić has stood firm</a> in the face of growing calls for his resignation. In fact, as <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/3172586\">scholars of politics and history</a> <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/5070699\">in Southeast Europe</a>, we have watched Vučić take Serbia even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c232a3c8-3f0e-495f-8280-dea6fccd292e\">further down an authoritarian path</a>. In so doing, he is drawing from the well-worn playbook of autocratic leaders past and present – not least his former boss <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biography/slobodan-milosevic\">Slobodan Milošević</a> and Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader Vučić openly admires.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, while Vučić can draw on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-supports-serbias-authorities-amid-protests-president-aleksandar-vucic-2025-03-07/\">support from Putin and fellow authoritarians overseas</a>, he is losing legitimacy at home. Opposing him is a new generation of civic activists who have <a href=\"https://thegeopost.com/en/news/all-about-the-new-poll-in-which-vucic-lost-the-election-by-10-percent/\">won the Serbian public’s backing</a> by reclaiming “inat” as force for positive change.   </p>\n\n<h2>Unmoved by a movement</h2>\n\n<p>The immediate trigger for the ongoing unrest came in November 2024 with the <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-minister-to-resign-over-concrete-canopy-collapse-that-killed-14-people-/7851070.html\">deadly collapse of a train station canopy in Novi Sad</a>, a city in northern Serbia. </p>\n\n<p>Renovated with funding from China’s <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2024/01/17/serbia-cements-china-ties-with-new-trade-and-tourism-association/\">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, the canopy was one of many projects touted by Vučić’s government as evidence of its success in attracting foreign investment. The accident’s 16 deaths, however, served to sharpen questions about corruption, failures of oversight and government accountability. </p>\n\n<p>Student protests gathered momentum through winter and into spring. One demonstration, on March 15, saw more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2g8v32q30o\">300,000 people turn out in Belgrade</a>. Activists have also employed civil disobedience tactics, like staging <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4r3ny9q2o\">pop-up roadblocks in Serbian cities</a>, to maintain pressure on the government.</p>\n\n<p>But Vučić has remained obdurate. On Sept. 1, while <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/tens-of-thousands-demand-justice-and-protest-against-populist-rule-in-serbia\">large crowds gathered in Belgrade and other Serbian cities</a>, Vučić joined Putin and other leaders critical of Western-style democracy at a large military parade in Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>Then on Sept. 20, Vučić <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-military-parade-vucic-criticism-opposition/33535694.html\">staged his own show of strength</a>, with soldiers and tanks taking part in a military parade in Belgrade as Russian-bought MiG-29 fighter planes flew overhead.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men in suits enter a room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692300/original/file-20250922-56-yj7dmb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić hold a bilateral meeting on Sept. 2, 2025, in Beijing.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/russian-president-vladimir-putin-and-serbian-president-news-photo/2232759722?adppopup=true\">Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From reform to repression</h2>\n\n<p>Vučić’s reaction to the protests and his cozying up to leaders of Russia and China reveal how the Serbian leader’s politics have changed. </p>\n\n<p>He was once perceived as a pro-European reformer. Indeed, Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party campaigned on a pro-European Union platform in the 2012 election that brought them to power.</p>\n\n<p>First serving as deputy prime minister before becoming prime minister in 2014, Vučić won plaudits for seeking to resolve long-standing tensions over Kosovo’s status as a sovereign country. At that time, it was Vučić who led his country’s negotiations with the EU over a normalization of relations between Serbia and its former province.</p>\n\n<p>Vučić also showed willingness to improve Serbia’s ties with neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Whereas many Serbian citizens still felt primary affinity for the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska, whose armed forces committed genocide at <a href=\"https://www.irmct.org/specials/srebrenica/timeline/en/\">Srebrenica in 1995</a>, Vučić risked domestic censure when, in 2015, he labeled that massacre of Bosniak men and boys by Serbian paramilitaries a “<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20150711-serbia-pm-calls-srebrenica-massacre-monstruous-crime-commemoration\">monstrous crime</a>.” Vučić also showed up at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-commemorate-srebrenica-genocide-bosnia-muslims-serbs-ed58930f9e53639f22939a6efedd478b\">Srebrenica</a> to pay his respects to the victims, despite local hostility. </p>\n\n<p>Those diplomatic gestures, along with his success in attracting foreign investment, won Vučić international praise as an effective reformer. Serbian voters, likewise, acknowledged the economic stability and the country’s improved reputation.  </p>\n\n<h2>Backtracking on record</h2>\n\n<p>Those assessments started to change in earnest, however, after Vučić secured election as president in 2017. Critics say that he has <a href=\"https://www.freiheit.org/western-balkans/vucic-system\">leveraged his position to amass power and influence</a>, mimicking methods familiar to those living under authoritarian-leaning governments in Hungary and Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.K.’s Brexit vote in 2016, the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and then the global disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic all changed the dynamics of the international community, reducing outside pressure that had advanced democratic norms.   </p>\n\n<p>What followed in Serbia was <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/01/serbias-authoritarian-return?lang=en\">backsliding on democracy</a>. Serbia’s once-vibrant media now operates as government cheerleader. Independent journalism outlets have faced <a href=\"https://www.mfrr.eu/serbia-media-freedom-in-a-state-of-emergency-new-report/\">harassment, censorship and lawsuits</a> as part of a state-sponsored campaign of censorship. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, Vučić changed his tune on Kosovo. He now pledges to protect the interests of the breakaway province’s Serbs and portrays Kosovo’s Albanian leader, <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2024/06/26/serbias-vucic-kosovos-kurti-fail-to-meet-after-preconditions-disagreement/\">Albin Kurti, as the obstacle to any normalization deal</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vučić has also backtracked, expressing support for long-time Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik – who has been barred from office by the country’s constitutional court, but defies that ruling. </p>\n\n<p>To Serbian audiences, Vučiċ accuses the EU of duplicity and anti-Serbian prejudice. Meanwhile, he <a href=\"https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2025/02/20/in-the-midst-of-mass-protests-serbian-officials-are-recycling-the-narrative-of-a-colour-revolution/\">smears the student-led movement as a Western-led “color revolution</a>” aimed at politically motivated regime change. Critics are “fascists” and “foreign mercenaries.”</p>\n\n<h2>Europe gets wise to Vučiċ</h2>\n\n<p>In all this, Vučiċ has drawn on Kremlin talking points and an authoritarian playbook to distract attention away from his government’s practices. He and his allies cast the current protests not as a movement built on <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2025/04/14/serbias-student-plenums-a-blueprint-for-renewing-democracy/\">grassroots mobilization</a>, but as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/serbia-usaid-vucic-trump.html\">result of meddling by foreign agents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In taking this authoritarian turn, Vučić invites critics to see parallels with Milošević, under whom the current president served in the 1990s as minister of information. Milošević, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/11/warcrimes\">died while on trial for war crimes</a>, did much to inflame Serbian nationalism in the early 1990s and presided over the bloody wars in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. After Milošević’s ouster in the <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2010/10/05/timeline-the-bulldozer-revolution/\">Bulldozer Revolution of 2000</a>, Vučić spent a decade in opposition before returning to government in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>And while European diplomats were for many years eager to court Vučić, even tolerating hedging tactics that saw Serbia expand ties with Russia and China, that changed amid the president’s response to months of protest.</p>\n\n<p>In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1904621335399035083\">noted on the social platform X</a> that Serbia “needs to deliver on EU reforms, in particular to take decisive steps towards media freedom, the fight against corruption and the electoral reform.” </p>\n\n<p>Marta Kos, European Commissioner for Enlargement, <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2025/09/09/european-commission-meps-criticise-serbia-over-protest-crackdown/\">delivered blunter assessment</a> six months later, noting in a European Parliament debate the “wave of violence and continuous use of force against protesters in Serbia.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such criticism has seen Vučić turn increasingly to China, Russia and also to the Trump administration, with Donald Trump Jr.’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/donald-trump-jr-visits-serbia-meets-president-aleksandar-vucic-2025-03-11/\">visit to Serbia in March</a> as emblematic of the warming ties between Washington and Belgrade.   </p>\n\n<h2>The ‘inat’ of the Serbian people</h2>\n\n<p>Vučić has spent over a decade directing a political spectacle in which he presents himself as the one force capable of saving Serbia. And for the better part of the past year, he has attempted to paper over the cracks in his rule through a strategy of imposing increasingly authoritarian measures at home while seeking support from like-minded regimes abroad.</p>\n\n<p>But the fact that this ploy has not extinguished the still ongoing anti-government protests suggests it may be a failing tactic.</p>\n\n<p>And like Milošević in the late 1990s, Vučić seems to have underestimated the force of “inat” of the Serbian people. The Bulldozer Revolution that ousted Milošević was comprised of Serbs from a wide range of backgrounds, all determined to bring down an unpopular autocrat who put his own political survival above the needs of citizens.</p>\n\n<p>They did so through grassroots mobilization and shared recognition that the true obstacle to prosperity was not foreign conspiracy, but Milošević himself. For all his individual stubbornness and spite, Milošević could not match the resilience and determination of Serbia’s citizens.</p>\n\n<p>That same energy appears to be in the streets of Belgrade now, sustained by a new generation of citizens standing firm against the tactic of a different autocratic leader.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/245878/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Keith Brown receives funding from the Finland Fulbright Foundation, and directs a Center that until recently has received funds from the US Department of State Title VIII program, the US Department of Education Title VI program, and the US Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Hanna Begić does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",
