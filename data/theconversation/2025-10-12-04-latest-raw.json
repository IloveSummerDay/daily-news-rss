Devoret</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/martinis/facts/\">John M. Martinis</a> – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven.</p>\n\n<p>The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the <a href=\"https://quantum2025.org/\">100th anniversary</a> of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/\">precision measurement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/summary/\">laser technology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1952/summary/\">medical imaging</a> and, probably the most far-reaching of all, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/summary/\">semiconductor electronic devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/summary/\">computer chips</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings.</p>\n\n<h2>The promises of quantum machines</h2>\n\n<p>Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2012/summary/\">photons and atomic ions</a>, that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions. These endeavors have given rise to the emerging field of quantum engineering, which aims to utilize the peculiarities of quantum physics for groundbreaking technological innovations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man speaking at a podium with a 'Berkeley ' sign on it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695629/original/file-20251010-56-h14fqq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">John Clarke, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, speaks on Oct. 7, 2025, at a press conference on the campus celebrating his 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/john-clarke-an-emeritus-professor-of-physics-at-the-news-photo/2239361965?adppopup=true\">Karl Mondon/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One of the most promising directions is <a href=\"https://www.science.org/toc/science/339/6124\">quantum information processing</a>, whose goal is to design and implement machines that can encode, process, transmit and detect information in “strange” quantum manners: For instance, an object can be in a superposition of different states at the same time. Distant objects can manifest <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/press-release/\">quantum entanglement</a> – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. </p>\n\n<p>The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality?</p>\n\n<h2>Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit</h2>\n\n<p>In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0829-5\">affirmative answer</a> to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1913/summary/\">superconductors</a>. Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/summary/\">Cooper pair</a>. These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls.</p>\n\n<p>To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/summary/\">Josephson junction</a>, which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1908\">quantum tunneling</a>, where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1543\">quantized, values</a>, which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications and outlooks</h2>\n\n<p>The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.69.80\">distinct quantum phenomena</a> – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting artificial atoms</a> has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812\">quantum computers</a> using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07128\">superconducting quantum bit</a>, or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. The perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgMWommXxU8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">2025 Nobel laureate John Martinis discusses the roadmap of building a quantum computer at the 2016 Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference in Los Angeles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. The prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation. </p>\n\n<p>From those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. The combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation. </p>\n\n<p>This Nobel Prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266976/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Zhixin Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Depending on how they’re structured, some have so much internal surface area that a single gram could cover a football field.</p>\n\n<p>This sponge-like porosity – meaning lots of tiny holes inside – lets MOFs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1230444\">trap and release gases</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chempr.2023.09.009\">store energy-rich fuels</a> like hydrogen, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">capture harmful pollutants</a>. MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules.</p>\n\n<p>These features have already inspired potential uses such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">capturing carbon dioxide from the air</a> to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">pulling clean water</a> from humid air, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D4RA04441J\">delivering medicines inside the body</a>. Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr200324t\">for sensing and detection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Atq5z5AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">our team</a> <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/rex-gerald/\">of engineers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz8jKuEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">has been developing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iYkrD9IAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN\">MOF-based sensors</a> that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>From a storage material to a sensing material</h2>\n\n<p>When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-chemistryprize2025-1.pdf\">tiny framework changes</a> ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. </p>\n\n<p>By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output.</p>\n\n<p>Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. </p>\n\n<p>This crystal-fiber combination worked as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19775\">a tiny device</a> that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3094092\">picked up these changes</a>, allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. </p>\n\n<p>Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification.</p>\n\n<p>In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371551\">diabetic ketoacidosis</a>, allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695515/original/file-20251009-56-jqsqqg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A photo showing a tube-like device, and a person exhaling into it out of their nose.

Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers.</p>\n\n<p>Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.5c00982\">we developed</a> a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.128608\">allowing it to detect gases</a> with remarkable sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity.</p>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal.</p>\n\n<p>These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors.</p>\n\n<h2>Toward real-world impact</h2>\n\n<p>The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100348\">degrade under humidity or heat</a>, though some research groups are looking into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">how to make them more stable</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b00937\">human breath monitoring</a>, where subtle changes in exhaled gases <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177518\">provide early clues</a> to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers are working to embed MOFs into <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60027-6\">flexible films</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-022-2226-6\">printed circuits and wireless devices</a>. With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale.</p>\n\n<p>If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267103/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jie Huang receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rex Gerald receives research funding from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the National Institutes of Health.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Bohong Zhang and Chen Zhu do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n\n<p>In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship.</p>\n\n<p>But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBPxHqkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8abR970AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and</a> our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom.</p>\n\n<p>Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"three men drink wine at cafe table with bill on it\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695419/original/file-20251009-56-4rzu1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/three-men-look-at-a-bill-in-a-cafe-and-divide-royalty-free-image/1312208692\">tim scott/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A focus on what friends give you</h2>\n\n<p>The traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_3\">social exchange theory of friendship</a> views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2008.00499.x\">what kinds of friendships to pursue</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2017.0737\">how to treat your friends</a>. It’s even <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/blog/social-exchange-theory\">made its way into pop psychology</a> self-help spaces.</p>\n\n<p>We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. </p>\n\n<h2>Less accounting, more supporting</h2>\n\n<p>Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216308098798\">likely to support their friends</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075241243341\">what they want in a friend</a>, they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective.</p>\n\n<p>People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met.</p>\n\n<p>Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2023.112120\">ranked higher in importance</a> than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, friendship <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015227414929\">isn’t always positive</a>. Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. </p>\n\n<h2>Friendship is more than the sum of its parts</h2>\n\n<p>But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of <a href=\"https://www.humangenerosity.org/\">The Human Generosity Project</a>, a cross-disciplinary research collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15800-2_4\">across societies</a>, from “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/646235\">kere kere” in Fiji</a> to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.22\">tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda</a>.

People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able.</p>\n\n<p>These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals.</p>\n\n<p>When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">environments are volatile</a> and when they ask those most <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.12.003\">likely to be able to help</a>. These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-010-9364-9\">keeping track of debts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events.</p>\n\n<p>And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges</a> such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">this same pattern</a> in an online study of U.S.-based participants.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09406-8\">branding cattle</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100095\">paying bills</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat</h2>\n\n<p>What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange.</p>\n\n<p>What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258549/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Athena Aktipis receives funding from the National Science Foundation.

MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me.</p>\n\n<h2>So, what exactly are MOFs?</h2>\n\n<p>Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern. The result is a highly ordered, porous framework – a kind of molecular architecture that’s both sturdy and full of empty space.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A model constructed out of metal bars and spheres, showing a cubic structure with smaller molecule models in the center.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695224/original/file-20251008-76-cuu6tk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, shown in this model, can trap smaller molecules inside their larger frame.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/heiner-linke-chair-of-the-nobel-committee-for-chemistry-news-photo/2239399344?adppopup=true\">Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These frameworks are so porous, like sponges with tiny voids, that it’s almost impossible to picture them. One gram of a MOF has so many pores that it can expose as much internal <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja3055639\">surface area as a soccer field</a>. It’s astonishing that a handful of powder could hide an entire landscape of surface within it.</p>\n\n<p>That enormous surface area is one of the unique things that make MOFs so powerful, and it comes from the nanoscale pores – tiny molecular rooms that can trap, separate, transform or transport gases, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/ion-physics\">ions</a> and other molecules. In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests.</p>\n\n<h2>Why scientists love them</h2>\n\n<p>What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space. Just by glancing at the periodic table, every metal could, in principle, serve as a cornerstone, and countless organic molecules can act as bridges connecting them. Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m91P-R3kxOs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So far, scientists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17755-8\">synthesized over 90,000 MOFs</a>, and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. </p>\n\n<p>Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01650\">isoreticular MOFs</a>. These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture.</p>\n\n<h2>Pushing the boundaries of these materials</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses.</p>\n\n<p>Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr2003272\">capturing carbon dioxide</a> from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA00264A\">clean polluted water</a> by removing heavy metals, dyes or “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-pfas-the-forever-chemicals-showing-up-in-drinking-water-an-environmental-health-scientist-explains-185015\">forever chemicals</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.200601878\">for medical applications</a>. In the energy world, they function <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214715\">as electrodes or electrolytes</a> that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/cr9003924\">serve as catalysts</a>, accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. </p>\n\n<p>When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram of molecules arranged in a cube structure, with empty space in each cube.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695225/original/file-20251008-56-7s2o61.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=753&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOF-5.png\">Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja903726m\">named MIL-125</a>. It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Demos_Techniques_and_Experiments/General_Lab_Techniques/Proper_Use_of_a_Desiccator\">no desiccator</a> – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench.</p>\n\n<p>That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/natrevmats.2015.18\">withstand water, heat and repeated use</a>. Since their foundation, researchers around the world have <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/materials/metal-organic-frameworks/conductive-MOFs-electrocatalyst-sensors/99/i43\">introduced new properties to these materials</a> – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. </p>\n\n<p>Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-023-00103-7\">clean water straight from desert air</a>, to building more <a href=\"https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/cooling-homes-without-warming-the-planet/\">energy-efficient air conditioners</a>. What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world.</p>\n\n<h2>A Nobel moment that honors creativity</h2>\n\n<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/press-release/\">honoring three remarkable scientists</a> – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies.</p>\n\n<p>When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in <a href=\"https://kampouri.blogs.rice.edu/\">my own research group</a>, we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this Nobel Prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: Chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267089/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stavroula (Alina) Kampouri receives research funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF) and other public research agencies.</span></em></p>",

Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/\">Nobel Prize in physics</a> was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a physicist who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=q1_eBhsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies superconducting circuits</a> for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted.</p>\n\n<h2>Big, cold, quantum</h2>\n\n<p>In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/profile/john-martinis/\">John Martinis</a>, then-postdoctoral researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2CeGqLAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Michel Devoret</a> and UC Berkeley professor <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R7uhrOoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works\">John Clarke</a> showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-do-superconductors-work-a-physicist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-resistance-free-electricity-202308\">superconductors</a>. A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. </p>\n\n<p>Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. </p>\n\n<p>Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"four parallel brass-colored rings connected by vertical tubes\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695206/original/file-20251008-56-um3aox.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/AFMC-News/Article/2470321/afrl-measures-first-superconducting-quantum-bits-qubit-first-ever-demo-for-a-do/\">U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.014021\">near-ideal microwave amplifier</a> based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8654\">emulate a group of electron-like particles</a>. This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. </p>\n\n<p>In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58947-4\">demonstrate a protocol</a> for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. </p>\n\n<p>But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing.</p>\n\n<h2>Superconducting quantum computers</h2>\n\n<p>Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-quantum-entanglement-a-physicist-explains-the-science-of-einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-191927\">entangled</a>, so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. </p>\n\n<p>In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them.</p>\n\n<p>Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else.</p>\n\n<p>The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, academic research groups <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/lfl/\">like mine</a> develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/10/1118297/ibm-large-scale-error-corrected-quantum-computer-by-2028/\">create large-scale quantum processors</a> for practical use. </p>\n\n<h2>Superconductor pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has <a href=\"https://qolab.ai/\">his own company</a>, while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. </p>\n\n<p>I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. </p>\n\n<p>Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266979/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Levenson-Falk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This includes much of the day-to-day work done by federal information technology and cybersecurity employees, including those at the nation’s leading civilian cybersecurity agency, the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>. </p>\n\n<p>CISA is among the entities that will see the deepest staffing reductions during the shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, according to Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/09/most-dhs-employees-will-continue-working-through-shutdown/\">documentation</a>. Only about one-third of its employees remain on the job after federal employees were furloughed. As if cybersecurity wasn’t challenging enough, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-government-shutdown-plan-employees/761365/\">fewer CISA employees</a> are being asked to do more and more work protecting American cyberspace during the shutdown. And they’ll be working with the promise of getting paid for their efforts at some date in the future once the shutdown ends.</p>\n\n<p>The current CISA situation is grim, from my vantage point as a <a href=\"http://www.csee.umbc.edu/%7Erforno/\">cybersecurity researcher</a> and former industry practitioner. The agency was already experiencing <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-departures-trump-workforce-purge/749796/\">deep cuts to its staff</a> and resources before the shutdown. And now, coinciding with the shutdown, a key law that enabled the agency to facilitate information-sharing with the private sector <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">has expired</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, the cyberdefense agency is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/02/cisa-shutdown-cybersecurity/\">being hobbled</a> at a time when the need for its services has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5529647-cyberthreat-sharing-law-expires-as-government-shuts-down/\">never been greater</a>, from the ongoing China-led <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-salt-typhoon-a-security-expert-explains-the-chinese-hackers-and-their-attack-on-us-telecommunications-networks-244473\">Salt Typhoon</a> attack on U.S. telecommunications networks to ransomware, data breaches and threats to infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>CISA was created in 2007 within the Department of Homeland Security. As its name implies, the agency is charged with <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/about\">digital security matters</a> across the federal government. The agency also works with the companies that operate and secure the numerous critical infrastructure sectors of the American economy, such as phone networks, the electric grid and energy pipelines. Additionally, it <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/state-local-governments-cisa-changes-2025-kristi-noem/\">helps state and local governments</a> across the country secure their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/local-governments-are-attractive-targets-for-hackers-and-are-ill-prepared-179073\">vulnerable</a> networks and data.</p>\n\n<p>CISA also publishes threat and vulnerability alerts for the government and cybersecurity community and engages with public and private stakeholders on best practices in response to emerging vulnerabilities. Prior to the recent expiration of the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>, the agency also made it easier for organizations to share useful information with the government to help cybersecurity teams better protect their systems.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4Q5hFykarQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Shutdown-mandated furloughs at the nation’s cybersecurity agency present an opportunity for malicious hackers.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political football</h2>\n\n<p>The agency takes a nonpartisan approach to cybersecurity matters. However, some politicians have accused the agency of political bias for its work helping states protect their voting infrastructure from cyberattacks and external influence. Specifically, the agency was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/14/934220380/as-trump-pushes-election-falsehoods-his-cybersecurity-agency-pushes-back\">repeatedly maligned</a> for calling the 2020 election the “most secure” in history. For some in elected office, this work on election security has tarnished CISA’s reputation and perhaps explains recent <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/cisa-congress-budget-workforce-cuts\">budgetary actions</a> taken against the agency.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, nearly 1,000 CISA employees <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/06/03/cisa-staff-layoffs-resignations-trump-cuts\">have departed</a> the agency through voluntary buyouts or deferred resignations. By the end of May 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-senior-official-departures/748992/\">nearly all of CISA’s senior leadership</a> had resigned or had announced plans to do so.</p>\n\n<p>For 2026, the president’s draft budget proposes to reduce CISA’s head count by nearly one-third, <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2025/05/dhs-budget-request-would-cut-cisa-staff-by-1000-positions/\">dramatically cutting</a> staff from its risk management and stakeholder engagement divisions. Other cuts will significantly reduce the agency’s collaboration activities and funding for CISA’s various cybersecurity education and training programs.</p>\n\n<p>Making the problem worse, the government shutdown began at the same time that Congress failed to renew the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12959\">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a>. This law provided a <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-case-for-reauthorizing-cisa-2015\">legal shield</a> that allowed companies and infrastructure operators to share timely and often sensitive information with CISA about the cyberattacks, vulnerabilities and incidents that they were encountering. </p>\n\n<p>In the wake of the law’s expiration, prudent companies may consider restricting what information they share with the government. Without the indemnification provided by CISA, many companies will likely have their legal teams review any information to be shared with the government. And that takes time. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adversaries do not reduce their <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/10/cyber-threats-abound-as-trump-guts-cyber-agencies-00284735\">attacks against the U.S.</a> based on available federal cyber defense funding or the status of cybersecurity laws. In fact, malicious hackers often strike when their target’s guard is down.</p>\n\n<h2>Charting a better course</h2>\n\n<p>Early in my career I had to work through a prolonged government shutdown. I’ve also participated in and developed assorted public-private information-sharing environments to exchange intelligence and analysis on cyber- and national security matters. And having been in the D.C. area for over 30 years, I’ve seen how government works. So I have a good idea of what’s needed to improve American cybersecurity. The following suggestions are a starting point.</p>\n\n<p>First, Congress could ensure that critical security agencies such as CISA are <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/03/congress-needs-to-shutdown-proof-cisa/\">immune from the threat</a> of recurring federal government shutdowns. If it desired, Congress could set budgets for America’s security agencies on a <a href=\"https://www.cagw.org/federal-budget-in-dire-need-of-reform/\">biennial basis</a> – as 16 states <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/fiscal/fy-2025-state-budget-status\">already do</a> for their entire budgets.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of cybersecurity funding, the White House’s proposed 2026 budget reduces research and education on cybersecurity. For example, the nation’s premiere federal cybersecurity <a href=\"https://sfs.opm.gov/\">scholarship program</a> to recruit, educate and place future federal cybersecurity workers <a href=\"https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\">would be reduced by over 60%</a>. Protecting this funding would allow CISA and the federal government to maintain the pipeline for a robust and capable cybersecurity workforce both today and into the future.</p>\n\n<p>Companies could develop new or expand existing nongovernmental information-sharing networks that are not completely dependent on the government to facilitate or fund, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/\">Cyber Threat Alliance</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/\">Center for Internet Security</a>. Cybersecurity relies on trust. But right now, the instability of the federal government makes it difficult to rely on any entity under its policy or funding influence, no matter how well <a href=\"https://sei.cmu.edu/divisions/cert/\">time-tested and trusted</a>. Regardless, without legal protections, the information-sharing utility of these services will be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Cybersecurity risks remain even if the federal government shuts down. So this is another reminder that each of us is responsible for our own cybersecurity. Individual users should continue to remain vigilant, follow accepted <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices\">best practices</a> for cybersecurity and always be mindful about online risks.</p>\n\n<p>It’s ironic that the federal government is shutting down, CISA is being eviscerated and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act has expired just as the country begins to observe <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month\">national Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a> – another collaborative public engagement activity that CISA promotes to help improve cybersecurity for all Americans.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266862/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richard Forno has received funding related to cybersecurity research and education from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Defense (DOD), the US Army, State of Maryland, and private companies during his academic career since 2010.

When doctors use genetics, it’s usually to try to identify a disease-causing gene to help guide diagnosis and treatment. But for most health conditions, the genetics is far more complicated than how clinicians are currently looking at it in diagnosis, counseling and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Your DNA carries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15393\">millions of genetic variants</a> you inherit from your parents or develop by chance. Some are common variants, shared by many people. Others are rare variants, found in very few people or even unique to a family. Together, these variants shape who you are – from visible traits such as height or eye color to health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.</p>\n\n<p>In our newly published research in the journal Cell, my team and I found that a genetic mutation involved in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">affected by multiple other genetic variants</a>, changing how these conditions develop. Our findings support the idea that, rather than focusing on single genes, taking the whole genome into account would provide insight into how researchers understand what makes someone genetically predisposed to certain diseases and how those diseases develop.</p>\n\n<h2>Primary and secondary variants</h2>\n\n<p>Certain rare variants can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK132154/\">cause problems on their own</a>, such as the genetic mutations that cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. But in many cases, whether someone actually develops symptoms of disease depends on what else is happening across the genome. </p>\n\n<p>While a primary variant might trigger a disease, secondary variants can alter how that disease develops and progresses. Think of it like a song: The melody (primary variant) is the main part of the song, but the bassist and drummer (secondary variants) can change its groove and rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why two people with the same genetic mutation can seem so different. One person might have severe symptoms, another person mild symptoms, and another none at all. These variations can even occur within the same family. This phenomenon, called <a href=\"https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Biology_for_Majors_I_(Lumen)/14%3A_Module_12-_Trait_Inheritance/14.12%3A_Penetrance_and_Expressivity\">variable expressivity</a>, arises from differences in the secondary variants a person has. In most cases, these variants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-018-0266-3\">amplify the effects</a> of the primary mutation. A higher number of secondary variants on top of a primary variant generally leads to more severe disease.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0XYWKm_LoM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Mutations are a source of genetic variation.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a primary variant and a secondary variant together can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1516767\">cause two different disorders</a> in the same person, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.38315\">Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome</a>. Other times, secondary variants have no obvious effect on their own but together can tip the balance of whether and how a disease will appear, even in the absence of a primary variant. This can be seen in the development of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.10.013\">heart disease in children</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Insights from a missing piece of a chromosome</h2>\n\n<p>My team and I studied a genetic change known as a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274565/\">16p12.1 deletion</a>, where a small piece of chromosome 16 is missing. Researchers have linked this mutation to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.534\">developmental delay, intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions</a> such as schizophrenia. Yet most children inherit this genetic variant from a parent who has milder symptoms, different symptoms or sometimes no symptoms at all.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why this happens, we analyzed 442 individuals from 124 families carrying this genetic mutation. We found that children lacking this piece of chromosome 16 had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more secondary variants</a> elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents. These secondary variants took many forms, including both small changes and large deletions, duplications and expansions of their DNA.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694248/original/file-20251003-56-dcfggh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=661&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two types of chromosomal mutations include deletion and duplication.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.611379\">Gandawijaya et al./Biorender via Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Each type of secondary variant was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">associated with different health outcomes</a>. Some were linked to smaller head size and reduced cognitive function, while others contributed to higher rates of psychiatric or developmental symptoms. This suggests that while a 16p12.1 deletion makes the genome more sensitive to neurodevelopmental disorders, which symptoms manifest depends on which other variants are present.</p>\n\n<p>The story gets even more complex when considering the fact that children not only inherit a 16p12.1 deletion from one parent but also inherit secondary variants from both parents.</p>\n\n<p>My team and I found that the symptoms of the parent with this genetic mutation <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">often match those of their spouse</a>. For example, a parent with a 16p12.1 deletion who shows signs of anxiety or depression is more likely to have a partner who also has these symptoms. This pattern, called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-dont-mate-randomly-but-the-flawed-assumption-that-they-do-is-an-essential-part-of-many-studies-linking-genes-to-diseases-and-traits-194793\">assortative mating</a>, means that when parents with overlapping genetic risks have children, those risks can combine and accumulate. </p>\n\n<p>Over generations, this stacking of secondary variants can lead to children who have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.10.015\">more severe symptoms</a> than their parents. </p>\n\n<h2>Biases in genetics research</h2>\n\n<p>One reason why scientific understanding of secondary variants has lagged is that genetic research often depends on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0467-5\">who is recruited to participate</a> in these studies and how researchers recruit them.</p>\n\n<p>Most studies recruit patients affected with a particular disease. Families recruited from genetic clinics typically have children with severe versions of the disease. But if studies focus only on patients with the most acute symptoms, researchers may overestimate the effects of primary variants and miss the subtler role that secondary variants may play in how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>But if researchers were to study people drawn from the general population – say, by recruiting people from a large shopping mall – some might carry the same primary variant but have far milder symptoms or none at all. This variability allows researchers to better dissect how different parts of the genome interact with each other and affect how a disease develops.</p>\n\n<p>In our study, for example, we found that people with a 16p12.1 deletion who were recruited from the general population often had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">milder symptoms and different patterns</a> of secondary variants compared to those who were recruited in a clinic.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person in white coat pipetting a sample into a vial, a DNA readout on a screen in the backdrop\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694249/original/file-20251003-56-me8ctz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Who’s included in genetics research influences how scientists understand disease.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/scientist-pipetting-sample-into-a-vial-for-dna-royalty-free-image/1334095553\">Cavan Images/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Embracing complexity in genetics</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of a deterministic view where one mutation equals one outcome, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.012\">more complex model</a> accounts for the fact that whether and how a disease develops depends on the interplay between different genetic variants and environment.

This concept is called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27174/\">self-tolerance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, scientists thought self-tolerance was primarily established in the parts of the body that make immune cells, such as the thymus for T cells and the bone marrow for B cells. There, newly created immune cells that attack “self” are eliminated during development through a process called <a href=\"https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/18-3-t-lymphocytes-and-cellular-immunity\">central tolerance</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, some of these self-reactive immune cells escape this process of elimination and are released into the rest of the body. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7636184/\">Sakaguchi’s 1995 discovery</a> of a new class of immune cells, called regulatory T cells, or Tregs, revealed another layer of protection: peripheral tolerance. These cells act as security guards of the immune system, patrolling the body and suppressing rogue immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram showing Tregs interacting with effector T cells and dendritic cells through various signaling molecules\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694664/original/file-20251006-56-uhafr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=735&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Regulatory T cells suppress immune responses using a variety of molecular signals.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mechanisms_of_suppression_by_regulatory_T_cells.png\">Giwlz/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While Sakaguchi identified the cells, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/83784\">Brunkow and Ramsdell</a> in 2001 uncovered the molecular key that controls them. They found that mutations in a gene called FOXP3 caused a fatal autoimmune disorder in mice. They later showed that similar mutations in humans lead to immune dysregulation and a rare and severe autoimmune disease called <a href=\"https://primaryimmune.org/understanding-primary-immunodeficiency/types-of-pi/ipex-syndrome\">IPEX syndrome</a>, short for immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome. This disease results from missing or malfunctioning regulatory T cells.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Sakaguchi confirmed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1079490\">FOXP3 is essential</a> for the development of regulatory T cells. FOXP3 codes for a type of protein called a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13290\">transcription factor</a>, meaning it helps turn on the genes necessary for regulatory T cells to develop and function. Without this protein, these cells either don’t form or fail to suppress harmful immune responses. </p>\n\n<h2>Harnessing the immune system for medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Regulatory T cells can be heroes or villains, depending on the context. When regulatory T cells don’t work, it can lead to disease. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-00994-x\">breakdown in immune tolerance</a> can result in autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks healthy tissues. Conversely, in cancer, regulatory T cells can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-019-0175-7\">too effective in suppressing immune responses</a> that might otherwise destroy tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how FOXP3 and regulatory T cells work launched a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cei/uxad009\">new era in immunotherapies</a> that harness the immune system to treat autoimmune diseases and cancer. For autoimmune diseases such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116440\">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2025.08.004\">Type 1 diabetes</a>, researchers are exploring ways to boost the function of Tregs. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2022.06.008\">For cancer</a>, the goal is to inhibit Tregs, allowing the immune system to target tumors more aggressively.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Diagram of immune activation scale in the shape of a rainbow wedge, with 'vulnerable to infection' at the smaller end, 'sweet spot' in the middle, and 'autoimmunity' at the larger end\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=260&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/559701/original/file-20231115-23-d6qlle.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Too much or too little immune activation can lead to illness.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inflammation_scale.svg\">Kevbonham/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond disease treatment, this research may also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1099\">improve organ transplantation</a>, where immune tolerance is crucial to prevent rejection.

You feel the wind blowing and see clouds move across the sky. Sometimes there are storms where the wind gets really strong, it might rain, or there might be thunder and lightning.</p>\n\n<p>Did you know that there’s weather in space too? It all starts with the Sun.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sun: The bright star in our solar system</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/en/\">The Sun</a> is a very hot, very big ball of gas at the center of our solar system. <a href=\"https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/surface.shtml\">Its surface</a> can reach a blistering 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). That’s nearly five times hotter than lava that spews from volcanoes on Earth, and just like lava, the Sun glows from the heat.</p>\n\n<p>The Sun <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/big-ideas/big-idea-3-1/\">is made up of</a> what <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/yeimy-rivera\">solar physicists</a> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/tatiananiembro/\">like us</a> <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/sam-badman\">call</a> plasma. </p>\n\n<p>Normal gases, like the air you breathe on Earth, are made up of atoms bouncing around. <a href=\"https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation/atomic-structure\">Atoms consist of</a> a positively charged bundle of particles called the nucleus and negatively charged particles called electrons. The nucleus and the electrons are tightly stuck together so that atoms are overall neutral – that is, they have no charge. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engage.aps.org/dpp/resources/what-is-plasma\">A gas becomes a plasma</a> when the atoms it’s made of become so hot that their negatively charged electrons split apart from their positively charged nuclei. Now that the charged particles are separated from each other, the plasma can conduct electricity, and magnetic fields may pull the plasma or push it away.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8cSQltH6TU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Plasma is made up of charged particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Solar wind blows out of the Sun all the time</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the Moon lines up with Sun, blocking it from view and turning the sky dark. This phenomenon is called a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/\">total solar eclipse</a>. During an eclipse, you can see faint, wispy structures surrounding the Moon that extend across the sky. In that moment, what you are seeing is the Sun’s atmosphere: <a href=\"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-corona/en/\">the corona</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The corona can reach millions of degrees, which is much hotter than the Sun’s surface. In fact, the corona is so hot that the particles shoot out of the Sun, escaping from the Sun’s gravity, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/\">engulfing the entire solar system</a>. This stream of plasma is called the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/what-is-the-solar-wind/\">solar wind</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The solar wind’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/2-solar-probes-are-helping-researchers-understand-what-phenomenon-powers-the-solar-wind-235286\">invisible, continuous gust of plasma</a> fills a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/heliosphere/\">bubble in space</a> that extends far beyond the orbit of Pluto. It can reach up to 2 million miles per hour (3 million kilometers per hour) – at that speed, the solar wind would take less than a minute to circle the Earth. For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/\">International Space Station takes 90 minutes</a> to go around the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s hard to see the solar wind directly in photos once it leaves the corona, we can measure the gas directly with instruments in space. Scientists have recently gotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c80TzqNoqMg\">up close and personal</a> with it by sending missions such as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/\">Parker Solar Probe</a> closer to the Sun than ever before. The Parker Solar Probe flies directly into the solar wind and measures the gas directly just as it escapes the Sun – like a weather station. </p>\n\n<p>The Parker Solar Probe also has a <a href=\"https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/250716-parker-closest-sun-images\">specialized camera</a> that points sideways to see the Sun’s light as it scatters off the solar wind. Light scattering is the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-sky-blue-246393\">same process</a> that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUIlhKhzDA\">makes the sky blue</a> on Earth.    </p>\n\n<h2>Big solar explosions</h2>\n\n<p>The solar wind <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a014800/a014892/14892_009_PSP_EarthSunHelioPause_1080.mp4\">surrounds and engulfs the Earth</a> and other planets all the time, but most of the time it is safely guided around us by our planet’s magnetic field. However, occasionally the Sun also generates huge explosions that release big clouds of plasma into our solar system, some of which are directed toward Earth. These massive events are called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3NAdOYp8Q\">coronal mass ejections</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kSx7AOwEco?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA spacecraft track solar storms from their eruptions on the Sun until their impact on Earth.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Compared to the solar wind, which is always blowing, coronal mass ejections are short-lived but extreme. You can think of them as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/solar-storm-knocks-out-farmers-high-tech-tractors-an-electrical-engineer-explains-how-a-larger-storm-could-take-down-the-power-grid-and-the-internet-177982\">solar storms</a>. Solar storms also involve one important force that doesn’t really play a role in the weather on Earth: magnetism. </p>\n\n<p>The Sun is like a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/\">giant magnet</a>. All magnets create what we call magnetic field lines, which are lines along which charged particles such as plasma have an easy time traveling. The Sun’s magnetic field lines can be very twisted, and the solar wind and coronal mass ejections deform and drag them outward from the Sun. </p>\n\n<p>When these solar storms reach Earth, their coiled magnetic fields can sometimes interact with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/earths-magnetic-field-protects-life-on-earth-from-radiation-but-it-can-move-and-the-magnetic-poles-can-even-flip-216231\">our planet’s own magnetic field</a> and cause disturbances called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-nqOJU55s\">space weather</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Space weather is caused by the Sun</h2>\n\n<p>The Earth has a magnetic field and a protective bubble: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4FSg-90XlA&amp;t=3s\">the magnetosphere</a>. The magnetosphere shields us from the Sun’s solar wind and solar storms, acting like a force field to keep living things safe from the energetic particles released by the Sun. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TnFXddv37E?wmode=transparent&amp;start=19\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Magnetic reconnection happens when the magnetic field from a coronal mass ejection interacts with Earth’s magnetic field.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Most of the time this protective bubble works so well that you can’t tell that there is anything special happening out in space. During particularly big storms, however, some solar wind plasma can make it down into the Earth’s atmosphere. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLq6plMjU0\">coronal mass ejections pass</a> over Earth, their magnetic field <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TnFXddv37E&amp;t=19s\">can interact with Earth’s magnetic field</a>. The Sun and Earth’s magnetic field lines untangle and rearrange, and for a short while these fields can link together and let the Sun’s plasma in.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens, it can cause big <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJfy8acFaOg&amp;t=120s\">magnetic storms</a> all over the world. This interaction between ejections from the Sun and the Earth is what scientists refer to as space weather. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Green lines of light crossing the night sky, above a snow-covered landscape.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690519/original/file-20250911-56-iv0094.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Space weather causes beautiful light shows near the North and South Poles on Earth.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=aurora%20borealis&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Rene Rossignaud, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Space weather is just like the weather on Earth, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/colliding-plasma-ejections-from-the-sun-generate-huge-geomagnetic-storms-studying-them-will-help-scientists-monitor-future-space-weather-248384\">generated by its atmosphere</a>.

The fossil evidence Darwin collected over his five-year journey eventually helped him to think about an <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin\">infinite variety of species</a>, both past and present.</p>\n\n<p>The HMS Beagle and its crew traversed these places while testing clocks and drawing maps for the Royal Navy, and the voyage was <a href=\"https://undsci.berkeley.edu/who-pays-for-science/\">funded by the British government</a>. Darwin’s position as a naturalist aboard the ship was unpaid, but, fortunately, his family’s private assets were enough to cover his living expenses while he focused on his scientific work. </p>\n\n<p>Today, government and private funding both remain important for scientific discoveries and translating knowledge into practical applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dE_Q4twAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">As a professor of science education</a>, one of my goals while preparing future teachers is to introduce them to the <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13165/chapter/7#78\">characteristics of scientific knowledge</a> and how it is developed. For decades, there has been a strong consensus in my field that educated citizens also <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/resources/science-all-americans\">need to know</a> about the nature of the scientific enterprise. This includes understanding who pays for science, which can differ depending on the type of research, and why it matters. </p>\n\n<p>Funding for science is more than just the amount of money. To a large extent, the organizations that fund research set the agenda, and different funders have different priorities. It can also be hard to see the downstream benefits of scientific research, but they typically outweigh the upfront costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic research leads to new knowledge</h2>\n\n<p>Basic research, also called fundamental research, involves systematic study aimed at acquiring new knowledge. Scientists often pursue research that falls into this category without specific applications or commercial objectives in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it costs money to follow where curiosity leads; <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-does-it-cost-to-run-a-lab\">scientists need funding</a> to pursue questions about the natural and material world. </p>\n\n<p>About 40% of basic research in the U.S. has been federally funded in recent years. The <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24332\">government makes this investment</a> because basic research is the foundation of long-term innovation, economic growth and societal well-being.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"7CZW2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7CZW2/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Funding for basic research is distributed by the federal government through several agencies and institutes. For more than a century, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/organization/history\">National Institutes of Health have sponsored</a> a breadth of scientific and health research and education programs. Since 1950, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/history\">National Science Foundation has advanced</a> basic research and education programs, including the training of the next generation of scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Other federal agencies have complementary missions, such as the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, created in response to the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957. DARPA focuses on technological innovations for national security, many of which have become fixtures of civilian life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/lifecycle-of-a-research-grant-behind-the-scenes-of-the-system-that-funds-science-255163\">Through a competitive review process</a> at these agencies, subject experts vet research proposals and make funding recommendations. The amount of funding available from the NIH, NSF and DARPA varies annually, depending on <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/process\">congressional appropriations</a>. Most of the awarded funds go to universities, research institutions and other health and science organizations that conduct research. The sum of research dollars awarded <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/federal-health-science-funding-states-map\">differs among states</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Applying research</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists undertake basic research to generate new knowledge with no specific end goal in mind. Applied research is different in that it aims to find solutions to real-world problems.</p>\n\n<p>Research that investigates specific, practical objectives or improvements with commercial potential is more likely to attract private investors. Companies directly invest in research and development to gain a competitive edge and turn a profit. Private industry is more likely to sink dollars into applied rather than basic research because the potential payoff in the form of a new product or advance is more visible. </p>\n\n<h2>From discovery to real-world implementation</h2>\n\n<p>As applied research addresses problems, promising findings are moved toward clinical application or mainstream use. This research and development process can lead to tangible benefits for individuals and society.</p>\n\n<p>Federal agencies such as the NIH make substantial investments in the basic and applied science underlying new drugs. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies heavily <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25353#\">invest in the development of drug candidates</a>. Recent reports have shown that <a href=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/phrma/fact-sheets/clinical-trials/TEConomy_PhRMA-_Biopharma-Industry-Sponsored-Clinical-Trials.2025-Report.Final_.pdf\">industry has been responsible for 50%</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ResearchAmerica-Investment-Report.Final_.January-2022-1.pdf\">or more</a> of the dollars invested in health and biomedical research in recent years. This expenditure includes significant <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.1921\">spending to advance clinical trials</a> – the studies that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-clinical-trial-a-health-policy-expert-explains-137221\">test new medical treatments</a> before they get approved for use. </p>\n\n<p>The NIH funded basic research that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1715368115\">contributed to every single drug approved</a> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2016. This includes key work that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/get-smart/vaccines\">led to COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign likely <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations\">saved the U.S. more than $1 trillion</a> in health care expenses that would have otherwise been incurred and also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223\">saved lives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Initial NSF investments in research was instrumental in <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/astronomy-space/black-holes\">capturing images of black holes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/oceans\">exploring deep oceans</a>. Basic research funded by NSF paved the way for everyday conveniences such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/science-matters/pocket-sized-progress-smartphones-nsf-innovations\">smartphones</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/origins-google\">Google search engine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/ai\">artificial intelligence</a>. Other funded projects led to quality of life improvements such as <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/asl\">American Sign Language</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/kidney-exchanges\">kidney matching</a> for transplants. <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/beyond-the-classroom\">Educational programming</a>, such as “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and “The Magic School Bus,” were NSF-backed projects, too. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CLOMZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CLOMZ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>It matters who pays: Funding shapes science</h2>\n\n<p>Funders and financial systems shape the trajectory of research across fields. Institutions advertise funding opportunities <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-100-million-investment-national-artificial\">based on their current priorities</a>. Changes in the amount of funding available ultimately <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-three-fourths-nsf-funding-cuts-education/\">direct the attention of researchers</a>. Any <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/21/nih-budget-cuts-basic-science-research-decline/\">interruptions to basic research</a>, such as changes to financial supports or institutions, may <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-ceo-us-crossroads-grave-danger-losing-global-research-leadership\">threaten future discoveries</a> and potential payoffs <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/proposed-cuts-to-nih-funding-would-have-ripple-effects-on-research-that-could-hamper-the-us-for-decades-262419\">for years to come</a>. </p>\n\n<p>According to numbers reported by a coalition of research institutions, every dollar that NIH spends on research <a href=\"https://www.unitedformedicalresearch.org/annual-economic-report/\">leads to $2.56 of new economic activity</a>. For the 2024 fiscal year, this means, of the $47.35 billion Congress appropriated for NIH, the $36.94 billion awarded to U.S. researchers fueled $94 billion in activity through employment and the purchase of research-related goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>Economist Pierre Azoulay and colleagues recently imagined an alternative history where <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aeb1564\">NIH was 40% smaller and dispersed less money</a> – a budget akin to current federal proposals. They argued that <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-federal-research-support-has-helped-create-life-changing-medicines-0925\">more than half of the drugs FDA approved</a> since 2000 are tied to NIH-funded research that would have been cut under this scenario. This thought experiment underscores how valuable those basic research dollars are.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xk94il8L820?wmode=transparent&amp;start=1369\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver’ points out some seemingly outlandish basic research that has yielded surprising real-world applications.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even seemingly out-of-touch or abstract studies may <a href=\"https://www.americanscientist.org/article/%E2%80%9Cwhy-are-we-funding-this%E2%80%9D\">precede discoveries with major impact</a>.

What happens to these particles within atoms would stay unexplained without this tool. The calculations using virtual particles predict the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles with such uncanny accuracy that some scientists think “they must really exist.”</p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are not real – it says so right in their name – but if you want to understand how real particles interact with each other, they are unavoidable. They are essential tools to describe three of the forces found in nature: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-electromagnetic-force\">electromagnetism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-strong-force\">the strong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-weak-force\">weak nuclear</a> forces. </p>\n\n<p>Real particles are lumps of energy that can be “seen” or detected by appropriate instruments; this feature is what makes them observable, or real. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are a sophisticated mathematical tool and cannot be seen. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Feynman\">Physicist Richard Feynman</a> invented them to describe the interactions between real particles.</p>\n\n<p>But many physicists are not convinced by this cut-and-dried distinction. \nAlthough researchers can’t detect these virtual particles, as tools of calculation they <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2022-06-quantum-electrodynamics-accurately.html\">predict many subtle effects</a> that ultrasensitive experiments have confirmed to a mind-boggling 12 decimal places. That precision is like measuring the distance between the North and South poles to better than the width of a single hair.</p>\n\n<p>This level of agreement between measurements and calculations makes virtual particles the most thoroughly vetted idea in science. It forces some physicists to ask: Can a mathematical tool become real?</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayQhNLqbTFk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles help scientists follow the interactions between particles.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A bookkeeping tool</h2>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are the tool that physicists use to calculate how forces work in the microscopic subatomic world. The forces are real because they can be measured.</p>\n\n<p>But instead of trying to calculate the forces directly, physicists use a bookkeeping system where short-lived virtual particles carry the force. Not only do virtual particles make the calculations more manageable, they also resolve a long-standing problem in physics: How does a force act across empty space? </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles exploit the <a href=\"https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/uncertainty-principle\">natural fuzziness of the subatomic world</a>, where if these ephemeral particles live briefly enough, they can also briefly <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2014-07-boosting-space.html\">borrow their energy from empty space</a>. The haziness of the energy balance <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834383-000-why-virtual-particles-dont-exist-but-do-explain-reality-for-now/\">hides this brief imbalance</a>, which allows the virtual particles to influence the real world. </p>\n\n<p>One big advantage of this tool is that the mathematical operations describing the forces between particles can be visualized as diagrams. They tend to look like stick-figure cartoons of particle pingpong played with virtual particles. The diagrams – dubbed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe7atm1x6Mg\">Feynman diagrams</a> – offer an excellent intuitive framework, but they also give virtual particles an aura of reality that is deceiving. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe7atm1x6Mg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Feynman diagrams help physicists calculate particle interactions.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Amazingly, this virtual particle-based method for calculation produces some of the most precise predictions in all of science. </p>\n\n<h2>Reality check</h2>\n\n<p>All matter is made of basic building blocks called atoms. Atoms, in turn, are made of small <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsprotons\">positively charged particles called protons</a> found at their core, surrounded by even smaller <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainselectrons\">negatively charged particles called electrons</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a professor of <a href=\"https://dd285.physics.msstate.edu\">physics and astronomy at Mississippi State University</a>, I perform experiments that often rely on the idea that the electrons and protons seen in our instruments interact by swapping virtual particles. My colleagues and I have recently measured the <a href=\"https://www.jlab.org/new-measurement-fits-another-piece-proton-radius-puzzle\">size of the proton</a> very precisely, by bombarding hydrogen atoms with a beam of electrons. This measurement assumes that the electrons can “feel” the proton at the center of the hydrogen atom by exchanging virtual photons: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsphotons\">particles of electromagnetic energy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Physicists use virtual particles to calculate how two electrons repel each other, with exquisite precision. The forces involved are represented as the accumulated effect of the two electrons trading virtual photons.</p>\n\n<p>When two metal plates are placed extremely close together in a vacuum, they attract each other: This is known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.4656\">Casimir effect</a>. Physicists can accurately calculate the force that pulls the plates together using virtual particle mathematics. Whether the virtual particles are really there or not, the math predicts exactly what researchers observe in the real world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of two black circles merging in space\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693952/original/file-20251001-56-rgzix.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Virtual particles can help explain how black holes act.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://mediaassets.caltech.edu/gwave\">SXS</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet another mysterious prediction made using the virtual particle tool kit is so-called <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/hawking-radiation\">Hawking radiation</a>. When virtual particle pairs pop into existence at the edge of black holes, sometimes the black hole’s gravity grabs one partner while the other escapes. This rift causes the black hole to slowly evaporate. Although Hawking radiation has not yet been directly observed, researchers have recently <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/hawkings-black-hole-theorem-confirm-0701\">observed it indirectly</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Useful fiction</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s circle back to the question: Can a mathematical tool become real? If you can perfectly predict everything about a force by imagining it is carried by virtual particles, do these particles qualify as real? Does their fictional status matter? </p>\n\n<p>Physicists remain divided on these questions. Some prefer to “just shut up and calculate” – one of Feynman’s famous quips. For now, virtual particles are our best way to describe how particles behave. But researchers are developing <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/\">alternative methods</a> that do not need them at all. </p>\n\n<p>If successful, these approaches could make virtual particles vanish for good. Successful or not, the fact that alternatives exist at all suggests virtual particles might be useful fiction rather than physical truth. It also fits the pattern of previous revolutions in science – the example of ether comes to mind. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/ether-theoretical-substance\">Physicists invented ether</a> as a medium through which light waves traveled. Experiments matched well with calculations using this tool, yet they could not actually detect it. Eventually, Einstein’s theory of relativity showed it was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>Virtual particles are a striking paradox of modern physics. They shouldn’t exist, yet they are indispensable for calculating everything from the strength of magnets to the behavior of black holes. They represent a profound dilemma: Sometimes the best insights into reality come through carefully constructed illusion. In the end, confusion around virtual particles may be just the price of understanding fundamental forces.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264739/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Dipangkar Dutta receives funding from US Dept. of Energy and NSF. </span></em></p>",

The contents spill onto the table, bench and floor. It’s a chaotic – but functional – solution to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Children have a penchant for unconventional thinking that, at first glance, can look disordered. This kind of apparently chaotic behavior served as the inspiration for developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a>’s best-known theory: that children construct their knowledge through experience and must pass through <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/2672709\">four sequential stages</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/X7rU9Wvm94M\">first two of which</a> lack the ability to use structured logic.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget remains the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.004\">GOAT of developmental psychology</a>. He fundamentally and forever changed the world’s view of children by showing that kids do not enter the world with the same conceptual building blocks as adults, but must construct them through experience. No one before or since has amassed such a <a href=\"https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Jean+Piaget%22\">catalog of quirky child behaviors</a> that researchers even today can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00359.x\">replicate within individual children</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While Piaget was certainly correct in observing that children engage in a host of unusual behaviors, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXEkpesAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">my</a> <a href=\"https://www.kiddlab.com/\">lab</a> recently uncovered evidence that upends some long-standing assumptions about the limits of children’s logical capabilities that originated with his work. Our new paper in the journal Nature Human Behaviour describes how young children are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02302-6\">capable of finding systematic solutions</a> to complex problems without any instruction.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb4TPj1pxzQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Jean Piaget describes how children of different ages tackle a sorting task, with varying success.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Putting things in order</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout the 1960s, Piaget observed that young children rely on <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">clunky trial-and-error methods</a> rather than systematic strategies when attempting to order objects according to some continuous quantitative dimension, like length. For instance, a 4-year-old child asked to organize sticks from shortest to longest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb4TPj1pxzQ\">will move them around randomly</a> and usually not achieve the desired final order. </p>\n\n<p>Psychologists have interpreted young children’s inefficient behavior in this kind of ordering task – what we call a seriation task – as an indicator that kids can’t use systematic strategies in problem-solving <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00jean\">until at least age 7</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, my colleagues and I found that increasing the difficulty and cognitive demands of the seriation task actually prompted young children to discover and use algorithmic solutions to solve it.</p>\n\n<p>Piaget’s classic study asked children to put some visible items like wooden sticks in order by height. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3BT7I0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Huiwen Alex Yang</a>, a psychology Ph.D. candidate who works on computational models of learning in my lab, cranked up the difficulty for our version of the task. With advice from our collaborator <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vOHeGXcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Bill Thompson</a>, Yang designed a computer game that required children to use feedback clues to infer the height order of items hidden behind a wall, . </p>\n\n<p>The game asked children to order bunnylike creatures from shortest to tallest by clicking on their sneakers to swap their places. The creatures only changed places if they were in the wrong order; otherwise they stayed put. Because they could only see the bunnies’ shoes and not their heights, children had to rely on logical inference rather than direct observation to solve the task. Yang tested 123 children between the ages of 4 and 10. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlsbcE6nOxk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Researcher Huiwen Alex Yang tests 8-year-old Miro on the bunny sorting task. The bunnies are hidden behind a wall with only their sneakers visible. Miro’s selections exemplify use of selection sort, a classic efficient sorting algorithm from computer science. <em>Kidd Lab at UC Berkeley.</em></span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Figuring out a strategy</h2>\n\n<p>We found that children independently discovered and applied at least two well-known sorting algorithms. These strategies – called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort\">selection sort</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort\">shaker sort</a> – are typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn0915\">studied in computer science</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More than half the children we tested demonstrated evidence of structured algorithmic thinking, and at ages as young as 4 years old. While older kids were more likely to use algorithmic strategies, our finding contrasts with Piaget’s belief that children were incapable of this kind of systematic strategizing before 7 years of age. He thought kids needed to reach what he called the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/concrete-operational-stage\">concrete operational</a> stage of development first.</p>\n\n<p>Our results suggest that children are actually capable of spontaneous logical strategy discovery much earlier when circumstances require it. In our task, a trial-and-error strategy could not work because the objects to be ordered were not directly observable; children could not rely on perceptual feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Explaining our results requires a more nuanced interpretation of Piaget’s original data. While children may still favor apparently less logical solutions to problems during the first two Piagetian stages, it’s not because they are incapable of doing otherwise if the situation requires it.</p>\n\n<h2>A systematic approach to life</h2>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is crucial not only in high-level math classes, but also in everyday life. Imagine that you need to bake two dozen cookies, but your go-to recipe yields only one. You could go through all the steps of making the recipe twice, washing the bowl in between, but you’d never do that because you know that would be inefficient. Instead, you’d double the ingredients and perform each step only once. Algorithmic thinking allows you to identify a systematic way of approaching the need for twice as many cookies that improves the efficiency of your baking.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithmic thinking is an important capacity that’s useful to children as they learn to move and operate in the world – and we now know they have access to these abilities far earlier than psychologists had believed. </p>\n\n<p>That children can engage with algorithmic thinking before formal instruction has important implications for STEM – science, technology, engineering and math –education. Caregivers and educators now need to reconsider when and how they give children the opportunity to tackle more abstract problems and concepts. Knowing that children’s minds are ready for structured problems as early as preschool means we can nurture these abilities earlier in support of stronger math and computational skills. </p>\n\n<p>And have some patience next time you encounter children interacting with the world in ways that are perhaps not super convenient. As you pick up your belongings from a café floor, remember that it’s all part of how children construct their knowledge. Those seemingly chaotic kids are on their way to more obviously logical behavior soon.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266438/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Celeste Kidd receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the Jacobs Foundation, and the Advanced Research and Invention Agency. </span></em></p>",

This makes early childhood one of the most important periods for developing empathy and other <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/what-you-need-know-about-social-and-emotional-learning\">social-emotional</a> skills.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, pretend play has been a natural way to practice empathy. Many adults can remember acting out scenes as doctor and patient, or using sticks and leaves as imaginary currency. Those playful moments were not just entertainment – they were early lessons in empathy and taking someone else’s perspective. </p>\n\n<p>But as children spend more time with technology and less in pretend play, these opportunities are shrinking. Some educators worry that technology <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/11/03/bcst-children-and-technology\">is hindering social-emotional learning</a>. Yet research in affective computing – digital systems that recognize emotions, simulate them or both – suggests that technology can also become part of the solution. </p>\n\n<p>Virtual reality, in particular, can create immersive environments where children interact with characters who display emotions as vividly as real humans. I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=htxbi2gAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">human-computer interaction scientist</a> who studies social-emotional learning in the context of how people use technology. Used thoughtfully, the combination of VR and artificial intelligence could help reshape social-emotional learning practices and serve as a new kind of “empathy classroom” or “emotional regulation simulator.”</p>\n\n<h2>Game of emotions</h2>\n\n<p>As a part of my doctoral studies at the University of Florida, in 2017 I began developing a VR Empathy Game framework that combines insights from developmental psychology, affective computing and participatory design with children. At the <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/\">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Maryland, I worked with their KidsTeam program, where children of 7-11 served as design partners, helping us to imagine what an empathy-focused VR game should feel like. </p>\n\n<p>In 2018, 15 master’s students at the <a href=\"https://fiea.ucf.edu/\">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy</a> at the University of Central Florida and I created the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2022.100561\">first game prototype</a>, <a href=\"https://babayagavrgame.wordpress.com/\">Why Did Baba Yaga Take My Brother</a>? This game is based on a Russian folktale and introduces four characters, each representing a core emotion: Baba Yaga embodies anger, Goose represents fear, the Older Sister shows happiness and the Younger Sister expresses sadness.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6gMdx9zDFA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The VR game Why Did Baba Yaga Take My Brother? is designed to help kids develop empathy.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unlike most games, it does not reward players with points or badges. Instead, children can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00112\">progress in the game</a> only by getting to know the characters, listening to their stories and practicing empathic actions. For example, they can look at the game’s world through a character’s glasses, revisit their memories or even hug Baba Yaga to comfort her. This design choice reflects a core idea of social-emotional learning: Empathy is not about external rewards but about pausing, reflecting and responding to the needs of others.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I have been refining the game since then and using it to study children and empathy.</p>\n\n<h2>Different paths to empathy</h2>\n\n<p>We tested the game with elementary school children individually. After asking general questions and giving an empathy survey, we invited children to play the game.

In addition, a few other children did not connect with the characters at all, focusing mainly on exploring the virtual environment. All three behaviors can happen in real life as well when children interact with their peers.</p>\n\n<p>These findings highlight both the promise and the challenge. VR can indeed evoke powerful empathic responses, but it also raises questions about how to design experiences that support children with different temperaments – some need more stimulation, and others need gentler pacing.</p>\n\n<h2>AI eye on emotions</h2>\n\n<p>The current big question for us is how to effectively incorporate this type of empathy game into everyday life. In classrooms, VR will not replace real conversations or traditional role-play, but it can enrich them. A teacher might use a short VR scenario to spark discussion, encouraging students to reflect on what they felt and how it connects to their real friendships. In this way, VR becomes a springboard for dialogue, not a stand-alone tool. </p>\n\n<p>We are also exploring adaptive VR systems that respond to a child’s emotional state in real time. A headset might detect if a child is anxious or scared – through facial expressions, heart rate or gaze – and adjust the experience by scaling down the characters’ expressiveness or offering supportive prompts. Such a responsive “empathy classroom” could give children safe opportunities to gradually strengthen their emotional regulation skills. </p>\n\n<p>This is where AI becomes essential. AI systems can make sense of the data collected by VR headsets such as eye gaze, facial expressions, heart rate or body movement and use it to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3574779\">adjust the experience</a> in real time. For example, if a child looks anxious or avoids eye contact with a sad character, the AI could gently slow down the story, provide encouraging prompts or reduce the emotional intensity of the scene. On the other hand, if the child appears calm and engaged, the AI might introduce a more complex scenario to deepen their learning. </p>\n\n<p>In our current research, we are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.34190/ecgbl.18.1.2663\">investigating how AI can measure empathy</a> itself – tracking moment-to-moment emotional responses during gameplay to provide educators with better insight into how empathy develops.</p>\n\n<h2>Future work and collaboration</h2>\n\n<p>As promising as I believe this work is, it raises big questions. Should VR characters express emotions at full intensity, or should we tone them down for sensitive children? If children treat VR characters as real, how do we make sure those lessons carry to the playground or dinner table? And with headsets still costly, how do we ensure empathy technology doesn’t widen digital divides? </p>\n\n<p>These are not just research puzzles but ethical responsibilities. This vision requires collaboration among educators, researchers, designers, parents and children themselves. Computer scientists design the technology, psychologists ensure the experiences are emotionally healthy, teachers adapt them for curriculum, and children co-create the games to make them engaging and meaningful. </p>\n\n<p>Together, we can shape technologies that not only entertain but also nurture empathy, emotional regulation and deeper connection in the next generation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263181/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ekaterina Muravevskaia does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

She soon became an expert in these wartime radiology techniques, and on top of performing the measurements herself, she also spent time training nurses to use the X-ray machines. </p>\n\n<p>After the war, Irene went back to her studies in her mother’s lab at the <a href=\"https://history.aip.org/exhibits/curie/radinst2.htm\">Radium Institute</a>. This is where she met fellow researcher Frederic Joliot, whom she later married. The two worked together on many projects, which led them to their major breakthrough in 1934. </p>\n\n<h2>A radioactive discovery</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/siYMeiR1Izg?si=f-Bapnd_WWyyYo4Z\">Isotopes are variations</a> of a particular element that have the same number of protons – positively charged particles – and different numbers of neutrons, which are particles with no charge. While some isotopes are stable, the majority are radioactive and called radioisotopes. These radioisotopes spontaneously <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radioactive-decay\">transform into different elements</a> and release radiation – energetic particles or light – in a process called radioactive decay.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Irene and Frederic’s discovery, the only known radioactive isotopes came from natural ores, through a costly and extremely time-consuming process. Marie and Pierre Curie had spent years studying the natural radioactivity in <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/themes/marie-and-pierre-curie-and-the-discovery-of-polonium-and-radium/\">tons of uranium ores</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In Irene and Frederic’s experiments, they bombarded aluminum samples with <a href=\"https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation/alpha-particles\">alpha particles</a>, which consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together – they are atomic nuclei of the isotope helium-4. </p>\n\n<p>In previous studies, they had observed the different types of radiation their samples emitted while being bombarded. The radiation would cease when they took away the source of alpha particles. In the aluminum experiment, however, they noticed that even after they removed the alpha source, they could still detect radiation. </p>\n\n<p>The amount of radiation decreased by half every three minutes, and they concluded that the radiation came from the decay of a radioisotope of the element phosphorus. Phosphorus has two additional protons compared to aluminum and was formed when the alpha particles fused with the aluminum nuclei. This was the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/133201a0\">first identification</a> of an artificially made radioisotope, phosphorus-30. Because phosphorus-30 was created after bombarding aluminum with alpha particles – rather than occurring in its natural state – Irene and Frederic induced the radioactivity. So, it is called artificial radioactivity. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A diagram showing an atom of 27-aluminum next to an alpha which is made of two neutrons and two protons.

In 1936, almost a decade before women gained the right to vote in France, she was appointed under secretary of state for scientific research. In this position, she laid the foundations for what would become the <a href=\"https://eepower.com/tech-insights/irene-joliot-curie-pioneer-in-radiochemistry/#\">National Centre for Scientific Research</a>, which is the French equivalent of the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health. </p>\n\n<p>She co-created the French Atomic Energy Commission in 1945 and held a six-year term, <a href=\"https://shethoughtit.ilcml.com/biography/irene-joliot-curie/\">promoting nuclear research and development</a> of the first French nuclear reactor. She later became director of the Curie Laboratory at the Radium Institute and a professor at the <a href=\"https://curie-joliotcurie.fr/en/about-us/biographies/irene-joliot-curie-2/\">Faculty of Science in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Medical uses of artificial radioactivity</h2>\n\n<p>The Joliot-Curie discovery opened the road to the extensive use of radioisotopes in medical applications. Today, radioactive iodine is used regularly to <a href=\"https://www.thyroid.org/radioactive-iodine/\">treat thyroid diseases</a>. Radioisotopes that emit positrons – the positive equivalent of the electron – are used in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GHLBcCv4rqk?si=rbUWpn9B8p8oqWgd\">medical PET scans</a> to image and diagnose cancer, and others are used for <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine\">cancer therapy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>To diagnose cancer, practitioners can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KXzONBPcPIk?si=VeUXIg4FEiOYoAtf\">inject a small amount of the radioisotope</a> into the body, where it accumulates at specific organs. Specialized devices such as a PET scanner can then detect the radioactivity from the outside.

The reason they work isn’t because they are secret – they work because they are contextual.</p>\n\n<p>The informal protective communication shared in schools, churches, workplaces and other organizations can be communicated and trusted based on the common language and cultural understanding of those giving and receiving the information.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2017 when the MeToo hashtag went viral, people have been trying to create online whisper networks. Projects like the <a href=\"https://shittymediamenlist.wordpress.com/\">Shitty Media Men</a> list and the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/p/Are-We-Dating-The-Same-Guy-100087483682257/\">Are We Dating the Same Guy</a> are both examples of trying to build a larger warning system. The <a href=\"https://www.teaforwomen.com/\">Tea</a> app sells itself as a digital platform that gives women tools to protect themselves and others when dating men. </p>\n\n<p>However, important components of whisper networks get lost when they are moved to anonymous nationwide warning systems. </p>\n\n<p>I’m an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AMoWpMgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">organizational communications and gender scholar</a>. My research focuses on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1089335\">whisper networks</a> and how people use them to keep safe in organizations. When this idea moves to a digital platform, the information may still be useful, but it is harder for participants to gauge how reliable it is. </p>\n\n<h2>What makes whisper networks work</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1089335\">Whisper networks</a> form when there is an environment of shared risk. Their purpose is protective. In other words, the people in whisper networks do not share information for punitive reasons, but to protect each other and to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-870\">make sense of their experiences</a>. There is an unspoken expectation that the receiver of information will also <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whisper-networks-thrive-when-women-lose-faith-in-formal-systems-of-reporting-sexual-harassment-196630\">share only with people they trust</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-870\">study of whisper networks</a>, participants talked about how they could assess the information they receive and give through personal interactions in their offices, congregations, schools and other organizations. They felt like they could measure the trustworthiness of the person sharing information and the trustworthiness of the people with whom they share information. </p>\n\n<p>They also talked about cues, including noticing how the person sharing information treats other people in the office and how they talk about other people when they aren’t around. This important component of whisper networks is difficult to translate to an app, even when the app claims to verify people as members. </p>\n\n<p>Women use coded messages and actions in whisper networks to figure out who is safe in any given room, who is in need of whisper network information, and when they decide that whisper network information is worth listening to. </p>\n\n<p>These protective messages tend to be shared either one on one or in small groups. Women know the information is reliable because of how it is shared and who shares it. For example, someone might say, “He is a little creepy toward the undergraduate women.” The person receiving the message uses the surrounding context codes to understand the seriousness of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Another person might say, “He makes people feel special and then uses information to be unprofessional.” Instead of a warning about actions, it is a warning about the process the harasser uses and what to watch out for. The person sharing the information wants the person they are protecting to understand the ways this perpetrator tends to move in relation to the people they work with. </p>\n\n<p>None of the language is specific, and it is largely coded so that the listener understands, and the person sharing doesn’t need to worry about the repercussions of sharing it. </p>\n\n<p>Interview participants told me that they usually share information in quiet conversations where they already trust the person they are talking to. </p>\n\n<p>When I asked participants about how they knew they were receiving whisper network information, they talked about how the person would lean in, drop to a different tone or volume, or how the vibe would change. It’s difficult to get any of those clues through an online platform. </p>\n\n<p>The risk of faulty information and misinterpretation goes up when information is shared on anonymous platforms or shared widely. When more specific stories are shared, it’s almost always in a trusted, private setting, not shared widely on an anonymous forum. When protective communication is broad, the network loses the very qualities that made it feel safe in the first place. Few of the nonverbal and social reputation signals exist on an app, and that makes the communication feel less trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Anonymous platforms can also create <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/25/us/tea-app-dating-privacy-cec\">potentially volatile situations</a>. Because people can post anonymously, there is more room for sloppiness, exaggeration and even defamation. These apps build on the myth that there is an individual solution and quick fix for sexual harassment and assault instead of <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-tea-app-problems-run-deeper-than-the-hacks-and-controversy\">acknowledging the underlying structural and cultural issues</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBcHMwA-MLs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In addition to being less effective than offline networks, whisper network apps and websites are vulnerable to hackers.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A different safety concern</h2>\n\n<p>Online platforms <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3686948\">offer users a limited understanding</a> of how their data is used and stored, so the user’s safety takes second place to the platform owners’ and investors’ financial incentives. These apps have largely been created by people who carry less risk and who are concerned with monetization, even if they also care about safety. The risks disproportionately affect those whose safety is already at risk. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to the issues of effectiveness and trust is the question of safety. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/02/nx-s1-5483886/tea-app-breach-hacked-whisper-networks\">Tea app has been in the news</a> because of two separate data breaches, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce87rer52k3o\">over 70,00 images that were leaked</a> to online message boards. Data included government-issued IDs, personal information and private messages. A separate breach <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/tea-apps-data-breach-gets-much-worse-exposing-over-a-million-private-messages/\">exposed direct messages</a> on the app.</p>\n\n<p>So while it’s conceivable that some online lists could be created for specific communities that share a common culture and language, no matter how good the intent is, it is unlikely that the creators of apps and websites are at the same risk of exposure as the people who use them. In addition, apps built for specific communities or communication styles would probably be significantly less profitable than those that are promoted nationally or worldwide and so are less likely to be built or sustained.</p>\n\n<p>All of this isn’t to say that apps aren’t useful and necessary. But based on my research, I don’t believe they provide the same safety and protection as in-person, organizational whisper networks.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265182/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carrie Ann Johnson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

A deficiency of iron leads to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034\">anemia, a condition</a> that results in fatigue, weakness, headaches and brittle nails, among other symptoms. Iron supplements can help reverse these symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, biochemists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2024.04.015\">pinpointed exactly how</a> iron helps proteins perform essential chemical reactions, not just for humans but all living organisms. Researchers know not only that iron is essential but also why it is essential.</p>\n\n<h2>Little evidence for chromium’s benefits</h2>\n\n<p>However, the same cannot be said for chromium.</p>\n\n<p>Chromium deficiency – having little to no chromium in your body – is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582150/\">extremely rare</a>, and researchers have not identified any clearly defined disease caused by low chromium levels.</p>\n\n<p>Like all food, essential metals must be absorbed by your digestive system. However, the gut absorbs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110527872-009\">only about 1% of ingested chromium</a>. Other essential metals are absorbed more efficiently – for example, the average person absorbs <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c01833\">around 25% of certain forms of ingested iron</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, despite many studies, scientists have yet to find any protein that requires chromium to carry out its biological function. In fact, only <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi963154t\">one protein is known to bind chromium</a>, and this protein most likely helps your kidneys remove chromium from your blood. While some studies in people suggest chromium might be involved to some degree in regulating blood glucose levels, research on whether adding extra chromium to your body through supplements can substantially improve your body’s ability to break down and use sugar <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.27.11.2741\">has been inconclusive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, based on biochemistry, there is currently no evidence that humans, or other animals, actually require chromium for any particular function. </p>\n\n<h2>Flawed research in rats</h2>\n\n<p>So how did chromium come to be considered an essential trace metal?</p>\n\n<p>The idea that chromium might be essential for health stems from studies in the 1950s, a time when nutritionists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110527872-009\">knew very little</a> about what trace metals are required to maintain good health. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19601404243\">One influential study</a> involved feeding lab rats a diet that induced symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. Supplementing their diet with chromium seemed to cure the rats of Type 2 diabetes, and medical researchers were enticed by the suggestion that chromium might provide a treatment for this disease. Today’s widespread claims that chromium is important for regulating blood sugar can be traced to these experiments.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Chromium crystals in the shape of jagged chunks and as a cube\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=358&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692261/original/file-20250922-56-jhtn99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Chromium has many uses as a metal alloy, but not so much as a nutrient.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_crystals_and_1cm3_cube.jpg\">Alchemist-hp/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, these early experiments <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.117.255901\">were very flawed</a> by today’s standards. They lacked the statistical analyses needed to show that their results were not due to random chance. Furthermore, they lacked important controls, including measuring how much chromium was in the rats’ diet to start with.</p>\n\n<p>Later studies that were more rigorously designed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2024.127482\">provided ambiguous results</a>. While some found that rats fed chromium supplements controlled their blood sugar slightly better than rats raised on a chromium-free diet, others found no significant differences. But what was clear was that rats raised on diets that excluded chromium were perfectly healthy.</p>\n\n<p>Experiments on people are much harder to control for than experiments on rats, and there are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2023.127338\">few well-designed clinical trials</a> investigating the effects of chromium on patients with diabetes. Just as with the rat studies, the results are ambiguous. If there is an effect, it is very small.  </p>\n\n<h2>Recommendations based on averages</h2>\n\n<p>Why, then, is there a recommended dietary intake for chromium despite its lack of documented health benefits?</p>\n\n<p>The idea that chromium is needed for health persists due in large part to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17226/10026\">2001 report</a> from the National Institute of Medicine’s Panel on Micronutrients. This panel of distinguished nutritional researchers and clinicians was formed to evaluate available research on human nutrition and set “adequate intake” levels of vitamins and minerals. Their recommendations form the basis of the recommended daily intake labels found on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nutrition-facts-labels-have-a-complicated-legacy-a-historian-explains-the-science-and-politics-of-translating-food-into-information-231894\">food and vitamin packaging</a> and the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx\">National Institutes of Health guidelines for clinicians</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite acknowledging the lack of research demonstrating clear-cut health benefits for chromium, the panel still recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet. This recommendation was not based on science but rather on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17226/10026\">previous estimates</a> of how much chromium adult Americans already ingest each day. Notably, much of this chromium is leached from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.117.255901\">stainless steel cookware and food processing equipment</a>, rather than coming from our food.</p>\n\n<p>So, while there may not be <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Chromium-HealthProfessional/#h14\">confirmed health risks</a> from taking chromium supplements, there’s probably no benefit either.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252867/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Neil Marsh receives funding from the NIH and NSF. </span></em></p>",

This protein acts as a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Together with other partner proteins, TOR controls how cells respond to nutrients, stress and environmental signals, thereby influencing major processes such as protein synthesis and immune function. Given its central role in these fundamental cellular activities, it is not surprising that cancer, metabolic disorders and age-related diseases are linked to the malfunction of TOR. </p>\n\n<p>Despite being so ubiquitous in science and medicine, how rapamycin was discovered has remained largely unknown to the public. Many in the field are aware that scientists from the pharmaceutical company Ayerst Research Laboratories <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i29/Rapamycins-Secrets-Unearthed.html\">isolated the molecule from a soil sample</a> containing the bacterium <em>Streptomyces hydroscopicus</em> in the mid-1970s. What is less well known is that this soil sample was collected as part of a Canadian-led mission to Rapa Nui in 1964, called the <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">Medical Expedition to Easter Island, or METEI</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a scientist who built my career around the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VMSDrYIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">effects of rapamycin on cells</a>, I felt compelled to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">understand and share the human story</a> underlying its origin. Learning about historian <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pyX4En8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jacalyn Duffin</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">work on METEI</a> completely changed how I and many of my colleagues view our own field.</p>\n\n<p>Unearthing rapamycin’s complex legacy raises important questions about systemic bias in biomedical research and what pharmaceutical companies owe to the Indigenous lands from which they mine their blockbuster discoveries. </p>\n\n<h2>History of METEI</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">Medical Expedition to Easter Island</a> was the brainchild of a Canadian team comprised of surgeon Stanley Skoryna and bacteriologist Georges Nogrady. Their goal was to study how an isolated population adapted to environmental stress, and they believed the planned construction of an international airport on Easter Island offered a unique opportunity. They presumed that the airport would result in increased outside contact with the island’s population, resulting in changes in their health and wellness.</p>\n\n<p>With funding from the World Health Organization and logistical support from the Royal Canadian Navy, METEI arrived in Rapa Nui in December 1964. Over the course of three months, the team conducted medical examinations on nearly all 1,000 island inhabitants, collecting biological samples and systematically surveying the island’s flora and fauna.</p>\n\n<p>It was as part of these efforts that Nogrady gathered over 200 soil samples, one of which ended up containing the rapamycin-producing <em>Streptomyces</em> strain of bacteria.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Poster of the word METEI written vertically between the back of two moai heads, with the inscription '1964-1965 RAPA NUI INA KA HOA (Don't give up the ship)'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=875&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693157/original/file-20250926-64-x9pac9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1099&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">METEI logo.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">Georges Nogrady</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>It’s important to realize that the expedition’s primary objective was to study the Rapa Nui people as a sort of living laboratory. They encouraged participation through bribery by offering gifts, food and supplies, and through coercion by enlisting a long-serving Franciscan priest on the island to aid in recruitment. While the researchers’ intentions may have been honorable, it is nevertheless an example of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/medicalapartheid0000wash\">scientific colonialism</a>, where a team of white investigators choose to study a group of predominantly nonwhite subjects without their input, resulting in a power imbalance.</p>\n\n<p>There was an inherent bias in the inception of METEI. For one, the researchers assumed the Rapa Nui had been relatively isolated from the rest of the world when there was in fact a <a href=\"https://www.mqup.ca/stanley-s-dream-products-9780773557109.php\">long history of interactions</a> with countries outside the island, beginning with reports from the early 1700s through the late 1800s. </p>\n\n<p>METEI also assumed that the Rapa Nui were genetically homogeneous, ignoring the island’s complex history of migration, slavery and disease. For example, the modern population of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar2004\">Rapa Nui are mixed race</a>, from both Polynesian and South American ancestors. The population also included survivors of the African slave trade who were returned to the island and brought with them diseases, including smallpox.</p>\n\n<p>This miscalculation undermined one of METEI’s key research goals: to assess how genetics affect disease risk. While the team published a number of studies describing the different fauna associated with the Rapa Nui, their inability to develop a baseline is likely one reason why there was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">no follow-up study</a> following the completion of the airport on Easter Island in 1967.</p>\n\n<h2>Giving credit where it is due</h2>\n\n<p>Omissions in the origin stories of rapamycin reflect common ethical blind spots in how scientific discoveries are remembered.</p>\n\n<p>Georges Nogrady carried soil samples back from Rapa Nui, one of which eventually reached Ayerst Research Laboratories. There, Surendra Sehgal and his team isolated what was named rapamycin, ultimately bringing it to market in the late 1990s as the immunosuppressant Rapamune. While Sehgal’s persistence was key in keeping the project alive through corporate upheavals – going as far as to stash a culture at home – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">neither Nogrady nor the METEI was ever credited</a> in his landmark publications. </p>\n\n<p>Although rapamycin has generated billions of dollars in revenue, the Rapa Nui people have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">received no financial benefit</a> to date. This raises questions about Indigenous rights <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/patents-based-on-traditional-knowledge-are-often-biopiracy-a-new-international-treaty-will-finally-combat-this-231272\">and biopiracy</a>, which is the commercialization of Indigenous knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>Agreements like the <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/223428?v=pdf\">United Nations’s 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity</a> and the <a href=\"https://chr-observatories.uwazi.io/en/entity/cqf2kyyvc38/toc\">2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> aim to protect Indigenous claims to biological resources by encouraging countries to obtain consent and input from Indigenous people and provide redress for potential harms before starting projects. However, these principles were not in place during METEI’s time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Close-up headshots of row of people wearing floral headdresses in a dim room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693160/original/file-20250926-56-q5omd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Rapa Nui have received little to no acknowledgment for their role in the discovery of rapamycin.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/EasterIsland-FireAmongtheMoai/54ca4d31ba2f47da8cfde3d2ff6d9fc2/photo\">Esteban Felix/AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-08-0377\">Some argue</a> that because the bacteria that produces rapamycin has since been found in other locations, Easter Island’s soil was not uniquely essential to the drug’s discovery.

Formally recognizing and educating the public about the essential role the Rapa Nui played in the eventual discovery of rapamycin is key to compensating them for their contributions.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the broader pharmaceutical industry has begun to recognize the importance of fair compensation for Indigenous contributions. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15451/ec2012-8-1.3-1-25\">Some companies have pledged</a> to reinvest in communities where valuable natural products are sourced. However, for the Rapa Nui, pharmaceutical companies that have directly profited from rapamycin have not yet made such an acknowledgment.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, METEI is a story of both scientific triumph and social ambiguities. While the discovery of rapamycin has transformed medicine, the expedition’s impact on the Rapa Nui people is more complicated. I believe issues of biomedical consent, scientific colonialism and overlooked contributions highlight the need for a more critical examination and awareness of the legacy of breakthrough scientific discoveries.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250586/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ted Powers does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They were much safer than earlier light sources, and they made more activities, for both work and play, possible after the Sun went down.</p>\n\n<p>More than a century after its invention, illustrators still use a lit bulb to symbolize <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=light+bulb+idea+icon\">a great idea</a>. Credit typically goes to inventor and entrepreneur <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/how-eureka-moments-science-happen/\">Thomas Edison</a>, who created the first commercial light and power system in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://history.utk.edu/person/freeberg-ernest/\">a historian</a> and author of a book about <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307057/the-age-of-edison-by-ernest-freeberg/\">how electric lighting changed the U.S.</a>, I know that the actual story is more complicated and interesting. It shows that complex inventions are not created by a single genius, no matter how talented he or she may be, but by many creative minds and hands working on the same problem. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q4rQDN6Z4s?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Thomas Edison didn’t invent the basic design of the incandescent light bulb, but he made it reliable and commercially viable.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Making light − and delivering it</h2>\n\n<p>In the 1870s, Edison raced against other inventors to find a way of producing light from electric current. Americans were keen to give up their gas and kerosene lamps for something that promised to be cleaner and safer. Candles offered little light and posed a fire hazard. Some customers in cities had brighter gas lamps, but they were expensive, hard to operate and polluted the air.  </p>\n\n<p>When Edison began working on the challenge, he learned from many other inventors’ ideas and failed experiments. They all were trying to figure out how to send a current through a thin carbon thread encased in glass, making it hot enough to glow without burning out. </p>\n\n<p>In England, for example, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Wilson-Swan\">chemist Joseph Swan</a> patented an incandescent bulb and lit his own house in 1878. Then in 1881, at a great <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/membership/library-and-archives/the-iet-archives/archives-highlights/paris-electrical-exhibition-1881\">exhibition on electricity in Paris</a>, Edison and several other inventors demonstrated their light bulbs. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s version proved to be the brightest and longest-lasting. In 1882 he connected it to a full working system that <a href=\"https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/edison-lit-manhattan\">lit up dozens of homes and offices</a> in downtown Manhattan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Edison’s bulb was just one piece of a much more complicated system that included <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history/landmarks/48-edison-jumbo-engine-driver-dynamo\">an efficient dynamo</a> – the powerful machine that generated electricity – plus a network of underground wires and new types of lamps. Edison also created the meter, a device that measured how much electricity each household used, so that he could tell how much to charge his customers. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s invention wasn’t just a science experiment – it was a commercial product that many people proved eager to buy.</p>\n\n<h2>Inventing an invention factory</h2>\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307057/the-age-of-edison-by-ernest-freeberg/\">show in my book</a>, Edison did not solve these many technical challenges on his own. </p>\n\n<p>At his farmhouse laboratory in <a href=\"https://www.menloparkmuseum.org/history\">Menlo Park, New Jersey</a>, Edison hired a team of skilled technicians and trained scientists, and he filled his lab with every possible tool and material. He liked to boast that he had only a fourth grade education, but he knew enough to recruit men who had the skills he lacked. Edison also convinced <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/J-P-Morgan\">banker J.P. Morgan</a> and other investors to provide financial backing to pay for his experiments and bring them to market. </p>\n\n<p>Historians often say that Edison’s greatest invention was this collaborative workshop, which he called an “invention factory.” It was capable of launching amazing new machines on a regular basis. Edison set the agenda for its work – a role that earned him the nickname “the wizard of Menlo Park.” </p>\n\n<p>Here was the beginning of what we now call “research and development” – the network of universities and laboratories that produce technological breakthroughs today, ranging from lifesaving vaccines to the internet, as well as many improvements in the electric lights we use now. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvPWA_zUc8&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Sparking an electric revolution</h2>\n\n<p>Many people found creative ways to use Edison’s light bulb. Factory owners and office managers installed electric light to <a href=\"https://stewartlighting.com/2024/03/29/how-light-bulbs-changed-the-world/\">extend the workday</a> past sunset. Others used it for <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/19thcent/consq19.htm\">fun purposes</a>, such as movie marquees, amusement parks, store windows, Christmas trees and evening baseball games. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/stagecraft/Stage-lighting\">Theater directors</a> and <a href=\"https://gamma-sci.com/2020/11/16/a-history-of-lighting-in-photography/\">photographers</a> adapted the light to their arts. Doctors used small bulbs to peer inside the body during surgery. Architects and city planners, sign-makers and deep-sea explorers adapted the new light for all kinds of specialized uses. Through their actions, humanity’s relationship to day and night was reinvented – often in ways that Edison never could have anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>Today people take for granted that they can have all the light they need at the flick of a switch. But that luxury requires a network of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeMbhk4Mmw&amp;t=72s\">power stations, transmission lines and utility poles</a>, managed by teams of trained engineers and electricians. To deliver it, electric power companies <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529785/the-power-brokers/\">grew into an industry</a> monitored by insurance companies and public utility regulators. </p>\n\n<p>Edison’s first fragile light bulbs were just one early step in the electric revolution that has helped create today’s richly illuminated world.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!
