Their message sparked a furious response on social media from President Donald Trump, who called the legislators’ action “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-democrats-death-penalty-sedition-military-orders-rcna245003\">seditious behavior, punishable by death</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>One of the lawmakers, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/democratic-lawmakers-illegal-orders.html\">told The New York Times</a> that she had heard from troops currently serving that they were worried about their own liability in actions such as the ones in the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26289122-opinion-in-dc-national-guard-lawsuit/\">not the first time</a> Trump has put members of the military in <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/trump-national-guard-posse-comitatus/\">situations whose legality</a> <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/military-personnel-seek-legal-advice-on-whether-trump-ordered-missions-are-lawful\">has been questioned</a>. But a large percentage of service members understand their duty to follow the law in such a difficult moment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M7GxgRkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">We are scholars</a> of <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/political-science/about/directory/geraldine-santoso\">international relations</a> and international law. We conducted survey research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s <a href=\"https://www.humansecuritylab.net/\">Human Security Lab</a> <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6036ca5c01be1f3ada2fcc09/t/68927fda1e3d781c333f40e8/1754431458649/RIWI_HSLAB_Toplines_June2025.pdf\">and discovered that</a> many service members do understand the distinction between legal and illegal orders, the duty to disobey certain orders, and when they should do so.</p>\n\n<h2>The ethical dilemma</h2>\n\n<p>With his Aug. 11, 2025, announcement that he was <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/08/trump-federalizes-dc-police-says-takeover-will-enable-federal-employees-work-peace/407370/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story\">sending the National Guard</a> – along with federal law enforcement – into Washington, D.C. to fight crime, Trump edged U.S. troops closer to the kind of military-civilian confrontations that can cross ethical and legal lines.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, since Trump returned to office, many of his actions have <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163181\">alarmed international human rights observers</a>. His administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/courts-immigrants-venezuelans-garcia-trump.html\">deported immigrants without due process</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/less-than-human-report-details-trump-immigration-detention-centre-abuses\">held detainees in inhumane conditions</a>, threatened the <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/trump-doubles-down-on-plan-to-empty-gaza-this-is-what-he-has-said-and-whats-at-stake/\">forcible removal</a> of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and deployed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/trump-national-guard-california.html\">both the National Guard and federal military troops</a> to Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, Chicago and other cities to quell largely peaceful protests or enforce immigration laws. </p>\n\n<p>When a sitting commander in chief authorizes acts like these, which many assert are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-illegal.html\">clear violations of the law</a>, men and women in uniform face an ethical dilemma: How should they respond to an order they believe is illegal? </p>\n\n<p>The question may already be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/trump-national-guard-california.html\">affecting troop morale</a>. “The moral injuries of this operation, I think, will be enduring,” a National Guard member who had been deployed to quell public unrest over immigration arrests in Los Angeles told The New York Times. “This is not what the military of our country was designed to do, at all.”</p>\n\n<p>Troops who are ordered to do something illegal are put in a bind – so much so that some argue that <a href=\"https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-107-issue-5/abuse-by-authority-the-hidden-harm-of-illegal-orders\">troops themselves are harmed</a> when given such orders. They are not trained in legal nuances, and they are <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/17/1/105/5374741\">conditioned</a> to obey. Yet if they obey “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Obeying-Orders-Atrocity-Military-Discipline/dp/076580798X\">manifestly unlawful</a>” orders, they can be prosecuted. Some analysts <a href=\"https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JLPP-27-2-Ghiotto.pdf\">fear that U.S. troops are ill-equipped</a> to recognize this threshold. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a blue jacket, white shirt and red tie at a lectern, speaking.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685164/original/file-20250812-56-nrfrlz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump, flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi, announced at a White House news conference on Aug. 11, 2025, that he was deploying the National Guard to assist in restoring law and order in Washington.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-c-speaks-during-a-press-conference-news-photo/2228986302?adppopup=true\">Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Compelled to disobey</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. service members <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/55743/law-military-obedience-mattis-military-orders/\">take an oath</a> to uphold the Constitution. In addition, under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, service members must obey lawful orders and <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/72934/wrestling-with-legal-and-illegal-orders-in-the-military-in-the-months-ahead/\">disobey unlawful orders</a>. Unlawful orders are those that clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, international human rights standards or the Geneva Conventions. </p>\n\n<p>Service members who follow an illegal order <a href=\"https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/2024%20MCM%20files/MCM%20(2024%20ed)%20-%20TOC%20no%20index.pdf?ver=b7JVpxV5rbIHg0ENlCRVKQ%3D%3D\">can be held liable</a> and court-martialed or subject to prosecution by international tribunals. Following orders from a superior is no defense.</p>\n\n<p>Our poll, fielded between June 13 and June 30, 2025, shows that service members understand these rules. Of the 818 active-duty troops we surveyed, just 9% stated that they would “obey any order.” Only 9% “didn’t know,” and only 2% had “no comment.” </p>\n\n<p>When asked to describe unlawful orders in their own words, about 25% of respondents wrote about their duty to disobey orders that were “obviously wrong,” “obviously criminal” or “obviously unconstitutional.” </p>\n\n<p>Another 8% spoke of immoral orders. One respondent wrote that “orders that clearly break international law, such as targeting non-combatants, are not just illegal — they’re immoral. As military personnel, we have a duty to uphold the law and refuse commands that betray that duty.” </p>\n\n<p>Just over 40% of respondents listed specific examples of orders they would feel compelled to disobey. </p>\n\n<p>The most common unprompted response, cited by 26% of those surveyed, was “harming civilians,” while another 15% of respondents gave a variety of other examples of violations of duty and law, such as “torturing prisoners” and “harming U.S. troops.” </p>\n\n<p>One wrote that “an order would be obviously unlawful if it involved harming civilians, using torture, targeting people based on identity, or punishing others without legal process.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration of responses such as 'I'd disobey if illegal' and 'I'd disobey if immoral.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=340&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/685177/original/file-20250812-56-orgrjx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A tag cloud of responses to UMass-Amherst’s Human Security Lab survey of active-duty service members about when they would disobey an order from a superior.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">UMass-Amherst’s Human Security Lab</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Soldiers, not lawyers</h2>\n\n<p>But the open-ended answers pointed to another struggle troops face: Some no longer trust U.S. law as useful guidance. </p>\n\n<p>Writing in their own words about how they would know an illegal order when they saw it, more troops emphasized international law as a standard of illegality than emphasized U.S. law. </p>\n\n<p>Others implied that acts that are illegal under international law might become legal in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>“Trump will issue illegal orders,” wrote one respondent. “The new laws will allow it,” wrote another. A third wrote, “We are not required to obey such laws.”</p>\n\n<p>Several emphasized the U.S. political situation directly in their remarks, stating they’d disobey “oppression or harming U.S. civilians that clearly goes against the Constitution” or an order for “use of the military to carry out deportations.” </p>\n\n<p>Still, the percentage of respondents who said they would disobey specific orders – such as torture – is lower than the percentage of respondents who recognized the responsibility to disobey in general. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>This is not surprising: <a href=\"https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JLPP-27-2-Ghiotto.pdf\">Troops are trained</a> to obey and face numerous social, psychological and institutional <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/17/1/105/5374741\">pressures</a> to do so. By contrast, most troops receive relatively little training in the laws of war or human rights law. </p>\n\n<p>Political scientists have found, however, that having information on international law <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343316657405\">affects attitudes about the use of force</a> among the general public. It <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00223433211010861?casa_token=TNwYUToDynUAAAAA:gg0XKxkUc4PxQ38YueLi7V9Oq-x5CvJqtXW-67MwqAu4-Zu0c51fcNMauttupFqMMaRxAr0JZiMadQ\">can also affect</a> decision-making by military personnel. </p>\n\n<p>This finding was also borne out in our survey. </p>\n\n<p>When we explicitly reminded troops that shooting civilians was a violation of international law, their willingness to disobey increased 8 percentage points.</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing the line</h2>\n\n<p>As my research with another scholar <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00392\">showed in 2020</a>, even thinking about law and morality can make a difference in opposition to certain war crimes. </p>\n\n<p>The preliminary results from our survey led to a similar conclusion. Troops who answered questions on “manifestly unlawful orders” before they were asked questions on specific scenarios were much more likely to say they would refuse those specific illegal orders.</p>\n\n<p>When asked if they would follow an order to drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, for example, 69% of troops who received that question first said they would obey the order. </p>\n\n<p>But when the respondents were asked to think about and comment on the duty to disobey unlawful orders before being asked if they would follow the order to bomb, the percentage who would obey the order dropped 13 points to 56%.</p>\n\n<p>While many troops said they might obey questionable orders, the large number who would not is remarkable. </p>\n\n<p>Military culture makes disobedience difficult: Soldiers can be court-martialed for obeying an unlawful order, or for disobeying a lawful one. </p>\n\n<p>Yet between one-third to half of the U.S. troops we surveyed would be willing to disobey if ordered to shoot or starve civilians, torture prisoners or drop a nuclear bomb on a city.</p>\n\n<p>The service members described the methods they would use. Some would confront their superiors directly. Others imagined indirect methods: asking questions, creating diversions, going AWOL, “becoming violently ill.”  </p>\n\n<p>Criminologist Eva Whitehead researched actual cases of troop disobedience of illegal orders and <a href=\"https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/121568293/E%20%20Whitehead%20-%20thesis.pdf\">found that when some troops disobey</a> – even indirectly – others can more easily find the courage to do the same. </p>\n\n<p>Whitehead’s research showed that those who refuse to follow illegal or immoral orders are most effective when they stand up for their actions openly.</p>\n\n<p>The initial results of our survey – coupled with a recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/hotline-for-military-service-members-sees-uptick-in-calls-following-activations-in-los-angeles/4209240/?os=vb_73kqvpgino_journeystrue&amp;ref=app\">spike in calls to the GI Rights Hotline</a> – suggest American men and women in uniform don’t want to obey unlawful orders. </p>\n\n<p>Some are <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/197545/soldiers-military-right-refuse-trump-unlawful-orders\">standing up loudly</a>. Many are thinking ahead to what they might do if confronted with unlawful orders. And those we surveyed are looking for guidance from the Constitution and international law to determine where they may have to draw that line.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story, initially published on Aug. 13, 2025, has been updated to include a reference to a video issued by Democratic members of Congress.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Zahra Marashi, an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, contributed to the research for this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270401/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charli Carpenter directs Human Security Lab which has received funding from University of Massachusetts College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the National Science Foundation, and the Lex International Fund of the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Geraldine Santoso does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

As Congress <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-CONGRESS/PRODUCTIVITY/egpbabmkwvq/\">passes fewer laws</a> due to <a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/political-polarization-may-slow-legislation-make-higher-stakes-laws-likelier\">polarization</a> <a href=\"https://corg.iu.edu/programs/hamilton-views/comments-on-congress/Why%20Does%20Even%20Popular%20Legislation%20Get%20Hung%20Up%20in%20Congress.html\">stalling the legislative process</a>, states have increasingly taken the lead on shaping AI governance. </p>\n\n<p>The Colorado AI Act defined “high-risk” AI systems as those influencing consequential decisions in employment, housing, health care and other areas of daily life. The law’s goal was <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/06/17/colorado-artificial-intelligence-law-implementation-ramifications/\">straightforward but ambitious</a>: Create preventive protections for consumers from algorithmic discrimination while encouraging innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s leadership on this is not surprising. The state has a climate that embraces <a href=\"https://www.coloradopolitics.com/2025/09/30/is-denver-poised-to-become-the-silicon-valley-of-the-new-west/\">technological innovation</a> and a <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2025/07/26/ai-skills-tech-colorado-job-openings/\">rapidly growing AI sector</a>. The state positioned itself at the frontier of AI governance, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-why-colorados-new-ai-law-is-set-to-make-a-splash\">drawing from international models such as the EU AI Act</a> and from privacy frameworks such as the <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/californias-approach-to-ai-governance/\">2018 California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. With an initial effective date of Feb. 1, 2026, lawmakers gave themselves ample time to refine definitions, establish oversight mechanisms and build capacity for compliance.</p>\n\n<p>When the law passed in May 2024, policy analysts and advocacy groups hailed it as a breakthrough. Other states, including Georgia and Illinois, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-different-states-are-approaching-ai/\">introduced bills closely modeled after Colorado’s AI bill</a>, though those proposals did not advance to final enactment. The law was described by the <a href=\"https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FPF-FINAL-CO-SB-205-Two-Pager-.pdf\">Future of Privacy Forum</a> as the “first comprehensive and risk-based approach” to AI accountability. The forum is a nonprofit research and advocacy organization that develops guidance and policy analysis on data privacy and emerging technologies. </p>\n\n<p>Legal commentators, <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/a-deep-dive-into-colorados-artificial-intelligence-act/\">including attorneys general across the nation</a>, noted that Colorado created robust AI legislation that other states could emulate in the absence of federal legislation. </p>\n\n<h2>Politics meets process, stalling progress</h2>\n\n<p>Praise aside, passing a bill is one thing, but putting it into action is another.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after the bill was signed, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/15/ai-tech-regulations-lobbying-00157676\">tech companies and trade associations</a> warned that the act could create heavy administrative burdens for startups and deter innovation. Polis, in his signing statement, cautioned that “<a href=\"https://tsscolorado.com/with-reservations-polis-signs-landmark-ai-regulation-bill/\">a complex compliance regime</a>” might slow economic growth. He urged legislators to revisit portions of the bill.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4VTAPk8ip4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">CBS News Colorado reports on state lawmakers racing to replace the state’s artificial intelligence law before February 2026.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/25/colorado-budget-artificial-intelligence-special-session/\">Polis convened a special legislative session</a> to reconsider portions of the law. <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/08/27/colorado-special-session-leads-to-further-delay-of-states-ai-law/\">Multiple bills were introduced</a> to amend or delay its implementation. <a href=\"https://tsscolorado.com/business-leaders-plead-for-changes-in-states-new-ai-law/\">Industry advocates</a> pressed for narrower definitions and longer timelines. All the while, <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2024/12/10/colorado-refines-ai-discrimination-law/\">consumer groups</a> fought to preserve the act’s protections. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, other states watched closely and changed course on sweeping AI policy. Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/california-governor-gavin-newsom-vetoes-ai-safety-bill\">slowed California’s own ambitious AI bill after facing similar concerns</a>. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-legislature-adjournment-artificial-intelligence-617d20eaba36a6fc8ad055ff9b4d7055\">Connecticut failed to pass its AI legislation</a> amid a veto threat from Gov. Ned Lamont. </p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s early lead turned precarious. The same boldness that made it first also made the law vulnerable – particularly because, as seen in other states, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/the-politics-of-ai-innovation-in-the-us-states/\">governors can veto, delay or narrow AI legislation as political dynamics shift</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>From big swing to small ball</h2>\n\n<p>In my opinion, Colorado can remain a leader in AI policy by pivoting toward “<a href=\"https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/policy-incrementalism-how-philanthropy-can-support-change\">small ball,” or incremental, policymaking</a>, characterized by gradual improvements, monitoring and iteration. </p>\n\n<p>This means focusing not just on lofty goals but on the practical architecture of implementation. That would include defining what counts as high-risk applications and clarifying compliance duties. It could also include launching pilot programs to test regulatory mechanisms before full enforcement and building impact assessments to measure the effects on innovation and equity. And finally, it could engage developers and community stakeholders in shaping norms and standards.</p>\n\n<p>This incrementalism is not a retreat from the initial goal but rather realism. Most durable policy <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-case-for-incremental-change-with-greg-berman-and-aubrey-fox/\">emerges from gradual refinement</a>, not sweeping reform. For example, the EU’s AI Act is <a href=\"https://nitafarahany.substack.com/p/the-eu-ai-acts-reality-check-inside\">actually being implemented in stages</a> rather than all at once, according to legal scholar Nita Farahany.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_rxOnCt3HQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A video from EU Made Simple explains the EU’s AI regulation, which was the first in the world.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Effective governance of complex technologies requires iteration and adjustment. The same was true for <a href=\"https://privacytrust.com/delays-to-the-new-eu-data-protection-law-implementation/\">data privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3693527-eu-contemplates-delay-in-groundbreaking-anti-deforestation-law\">environmental regulation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/transparency-is-essential-for-effective-social-media-regulation/\">social media oversight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 2010s, social media platforms grew unchecked, <a href=\"https://time.com/7326940/america-must-regulate-social-media/\">generating public benefits but also new harms</a>. Only after extensive research and <a href=\"https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/chaire-numerique/en/2020/07/09/how-public-pressure-forced-facebook-to-change-its-policies-on-hate-speech/\">public pressure</a> did governments begin <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/states-in-the-vanguard-social-media-policy-today/\">regulating content and data practices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s AI law may represent the start of a similar trajectory: an early, imperfect step that prompts learning, revision and eventual standardization across states.</p>\n\n<p>The core challenge is striking a workable balance. Regulations need to protect people from unfair or unclear AI decisions without creating such heavy burdens that businesses hesitate to build or deploy new tools. With its thriving tech sector and pragmatic policy culture, Colorado is well positioned to model that balance by embracing incremental, accountable policymaking. In doing so, the state can turn a stalled start into a blueprint for how states nationwide might govern AI responsibly.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269065/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stefani Langehennig receives funding from the American Political Science Association&#39;s (APSA) Centennial Center Research Center.</span></em></p>",

Most political memoirs are written to advance the politician’s career. Fetterman’s, however, discusses his dissatisfaction with Congress and spends far more time on his battles with depression than his role as a senator. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reforming-philadelphia-1682-2022\">a politics professor who studies Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, I find that one of the most unique things about Fetterman is his political rise from mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania – a small borough outside Pittsburgh with fewer than 2,000 residents – to the U.S. Senate.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, while this sort of political leap is highly unusual, it also reflects a recent trend in American politics. Over the past five years, more mayors of small and midsized cities have developed national political profiles in a way they hadn’t before.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a phenomenon that has roots in suburbanization and 1990s-era political trends, and it’s one we will likely see again in 2028, at least among Democrats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"View of steel plant and river with residential homes in distance\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703680/original/file-20251120-66-3eapon.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A view of a steel plant in Braddock, Pa.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/general-view-of-the-exterior-of-the-u-s-steel-edgar-news-photo/2092452512\">Jeff Swensen via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From small town to Senate chambers</h2>\n\n<p>Boroughs are the smallest form of municipality in Pennsylvania, and there are <a href=\"https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/how-many-municipalities-are-in-pennsylvania/\">more than 950 of them</a> in the state. The office of borough mayor is so insignificant that in Braddock, it came with a small stipend instead of a salary. </p>\n\n<p>Yet after holding that obscure position for a decade, Fetterman mounted a credible campaign to be the Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in 2016. He fell short but captured <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/pennsylvania\">nearly 20% of the primary vote</a> against three other candidates.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Fetterman was <a href=\"https://www.cityandstatepa.com/personality/2021/06/how-john-fetterman-redefined-role-lieutenant-governor/364575/\">elected Pennsylvania lieutenant governor</a>, and then in 2022, he ran again for the Senate. He beat Conor Lamb <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/17/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html\">by a landslide</a> in the Democratic primary and then <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/pennsylvania-senate-results/\">squeaked out a victory</a> against Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem incredible that someone could jump from being a borough mayor to lieutenant governor and then U.S. senator. But other politicians over the past decade have used their positions as mayors of small-to-midsized cities to run for national office, including the U.S. presidency. </p>\n\n<p>Cory Booker, for instance, was elected mayor of Newark, New Jersey, in 2006; U.S. senator in 2013; and briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Booker was joined in the early race to be the Democratic presidential nominee by Pete Buttigieg, who was elected mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in 2011; and Wayne Messam, who was elected mayor of Miramar, Florida, in 2015. </p>\n\n<p>The 2020 presidential primaries also included some big-city mayors like then-New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio and his immediate predecessor, Mike Bloomberg.

As Booker noted in his 2017 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/258402/united-by-cory-booker/\">“United,”</a> he was, in 2013, the 1,949th person to ever be sworn in as a U.S. senator, but “only the 21st person since 1789 to ascend directly from mayor to Senator.” </p>\n\n<h2>Free trade and fractured bonds</h2>\n\n<p>How did this trend start? I trace it back to the eight years of the Clinton presidency, from 1993 to 2001, and more specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R42965\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> that went into effect in 1994 and the Clinton administration’s focus on community and civil society.</p>\n\n<p>NAFTA was a treaty signed by the U.S., Mexico and Canada agreeing to lift tariffs and other barriers to trade. It had bipartisan support, but it was also politically divisive, especially with labor unions, historically a key pillar of the Democratic Party, which did not want to see manufacturers move their operations to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. </p>\n\n<p>NAFTA is often blamed for, among other things, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/magazine/nafta-tarriffs-economy-trump-kamala-harris.html\">“hollowing out” of U.S. communities in the Rust Belt</a> that stretches from the Northeast to the Upper Midwest states that surround the Great Lakes. In this vast area, there are thousands of small and midsized towns and cities, many of which depended on single industries like paper milling or auto parts manufacturing. Once those businesses relocated, residents found themselves unemployed, underemployed and stranded in increasingly poorer towns.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, President Bill Clinton convened a series of <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-truth-of-power/9780231144391/\">seminars on American democracy and community</a> at Camp David and the White House. He invited some of the country’s most prominent “communitarian” intellectuals to glean policy and speech ideas from them. He also established the AmeriCorps program, which expanded and provided support for various civic-oriented volunteer opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Of the mayors who developed national political profiles in the 2010s, arguably the most successful were Booker, Buttigieg and Fetterman. All three came from Rust Belt communities that had suffered severely from the deindustrialization that many residents and analysts of various stripes blamed on NAFTA, and all three spoke effectively about their personal experience with it in their communities. </p>\n\n<p>Each mayor was also able to tell stories about personal interactions and interventions in their cities that spoke to the sense of a lost community that came to define the turn of the 21st century. The hardest evidence for this lost community came from the book <a href=\"http://bowlingalone.com/\">“Bowling Alone”</a> by American political scientist Robert Putnam, who participated in the White House seminars on community and American democracy. </p>\n\n<p>It’s also notable that, prior to running for mayor of Braddock, Fetterman <a href=\"https://john-fetterman.medium.com/back-in-1995-i-quit-my-job-and-joined-americorps-c93e78b06527\">worked at an AmeriCorps program</a> in a poor Pittsburgh neighborhood.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Tall bald man in black shirt and jeans speaks to three workers sitting in a diner\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=387&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703679/original/file-20251120-56-u7ehr5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">John Fetterman talks to customers at a diner in the depressed steel town of Clairton, Pa., in 2018.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/mayor-john-fetterman-strikes-up-a-conversation-with-chuck-news-photo/978441172\">Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Suburbanization and polarization</h2>\n\n<p>Immediately after World War II, federal mortgage guarantees and massive investment in highways fueled suburban housing construction, for which the returning GIs and the baby boom created huge demand. </p>\n\n<p>Along with suburbanization has come political polarization. Urban areas are increasingly composed of people with liberal ideologies, while rural areas are increasingly more conservative. Suburban areas fall somewhere in between – often serving as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-trump-won-pennsylvania-and-what-the-numbers-from-key-counties-show-about-the-future-of-a-pivotal-swing-state-243127\">key battlegrounds in statewide elections</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Midsized cities like South Bend or Miramar are often suburban in nature and design. They typically don’t carry the Democratic ideological baggage of large cities, but they are often also dealing with so-called urban problems such as poverty and crime. This is especially true of Braddock, a suburb with uniquely high levels of <a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US4207992-braddock-pa/\">poverty and unemployment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A mayor like Fetterman can therefore show how he’s able to address fundamental and widespread problems while at the same time being relatively nonpartisan about it. Among his better-known <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/08/wrought-from-ruins\">accomplishments as Braddock mayor</a> were building a new community center, rehabbing properties, establishing an urban farm and running a youth program.</p>\n\n<p>No doubt, Fetterman is a unique politician. But he is also the product of a specific moment in American political development and culture when mayors became viable actors on the national stage. My guess is that this trend will continue in what will most likely be a crowded Democratic presidential primary race in 2028.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269993/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richardson Dilworth does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Frogs and other inflatable costumes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jb8rXPkL3xY\">became a fixture of protests</a> against Trump administration actions everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C26&amp;q=Anya+Galli+Robertson+&amp;btnG=\">sociologist</a> who studies social movements and political discourse, I knew when I saw the video that we’d soon see frogs everywhere at protests. </p>\n\n<p>And indeed, the costumes have visually distinguished recent events from earlier anti-Trump demonstrations, softening their public image at a time when Republican officials were calling protesters “violent” and “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/no-kings-protest-mike-johnson-00602705\">Antifa people</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to be violent in a frog suit.</p>\n\n<p>Humor is subversive.

The term “mail-order bride” was treated as a punch line – something outdated, associated with lonely men and poor women who migrated from Eastern Europe, Asia or other places to meet their new husbands in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>But I’ve seen firsthand how ideas about gender, intimacy and global mobility have shifted. In 2025, a man going abroad to look for love might call himself <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a64387699/what-is-a-passport-bro/\">a “passport bro</a>” – and celebrate his lifestyle <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/passport-bros?lang=en\">on TikTok</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This new generation of young men may have rebranded international dating, but they reflect an age-old theme. Social and economic changes shape how people negotiate love and labor across borders, as I explore in <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">my 2025 book, “Economies of Gender</a>.” In a chaotic world, some men and women turn to <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2025/08/gender-roles-sexism-jobs-class\">traditional gender roles</a> as a source of seeming stability – and that often leads them abroad.</p>\n\n<h2>Old industry, new look</h2>\n\n<p>The term “mail-order bride” dates back to the 19th century, when so-called <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479821327/buying-a-bride/\">frontier brides</a> advertised themselves in newspapers to single men in the American West. After the Civil War, when large numbers of men had died on the East Coast, some <a href=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2023/06/mail-order-brides/\">women saw migrating to the frontier</a> to marry someone sight unseen as a way to secure stability. That narrative still lingers today in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367877911419160\">Western novels and films</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The modern international matchmaking industry, however, took shape in the 1970s, when catalogs of mostly Filipino women’s photos and addresses were sold to American men. After being pen pals, men would travel to the Philippines to meet and decide whether they wanted to get married. Some scholars <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.36646/mjlr.28.1.mail-order\">consider this a form of human trafficking</a>, but that has been challenged by <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/flyer/books/romance-on-a-global-stage/paper\">other scholarship</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These catalogs emerged as more U.S. women were <a href=\"https://blog.dol.gov/2023/03/15/working-women-data-from-the-past-present-and-future\">entering the workforce</a> and earning their own money. Some men sought wives abroad who they believed would embody more traditional values – prioritizing domestic work and devoting themselves to men and children.</p>\n\n<p>Over the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm\">next few decades</a>, large numbers of <a href=\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds_legacy/244/\">stable, well-paying factory jobs disappeared</a>, further challenging some men’s view of themselves as breadwinners.</p>\n\n<p>By 2010, the catalog system had moved online and expanded into a global industry that generated <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2013/04/09/the-mail-order-bride-boom/\">US$2 billion dollars per year</a>. Today, it <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">takes many forms</a>. Most of the industry is online, with email and chat correspondence that charges men but not women. Some agencies provide in-person tours for male clients, and there are higher-end, more personalized matchmaking services as well.</p>\n\n<h2>From taboo to televised</h2>\n\n<p>What was once stigmatized has become more normalized through reality TV. TLC’s hit series “90 Day Fiance,” which came on air in 2014, has transformed international dating into <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/90-day-fiance-tlc-reality-tv-franchise-success.html\">a lucrative entertainment franchise</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A brunette woman with curly hair, wearing a pink sleeveless shirt, embraces a dark-haired man in a white t-shirt, with two suitcases in the corner.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703682/original/file-20251120-66-dt17ep.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The stresses of the K-1 visa process have become fodder for reality TV.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/couple-embraced-at-airport-royalty-free-image/187105138?phrase=airport%20girlfriend%20boyfriend%20welcome&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">AMR Image/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The show and its numerous spin-offs show couples navigating <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration/nonimmigrant-visa-for-a-fiance-k-1.html\">the K-1 visa process</a>, which gives 90 days to marry after a partner enters the country. If the wedding is called off, the foreign fiance or fiancee must return to their country of origin.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the featured couples met randomly, in person. A significant number, however, connected through online dating or language-learning sites. Numerous couples’ storylines highlight family and friends of the American partner who question the girlfriend’s or boyfriend’s motives, accusing them of faking love for financial gain and access to a <a href=\"https://cis.org/North/Victims-MarriageRelated-Immigration-Fraud-Tell-Their-Stories\">green card</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Audiences might watch the show for drama or love stories, but the underlying themes mirror what I’ve seen in the field: relationships shaped by <a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/economies-of-gender/9781978842779/\">economic inequality and migration</a>, with women often exchanging emotional, domestic and sexual labor in return for financial stability.</p>\n\n<h2>Rise of the ‘passport bros’</h2>\n\n<p>In recent years, the mail-order bride industry has gotten a cultural revamp, with younger and more diverse men who identify as “passport bros.” This crowd is typically <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/bang-the-world-nathan-west\">younger than men</a> participating in the commercial international dating industry and more likely to identify as men of color. </p>\n\n<p>These men are less likely to pay for formal dating and introduction services. They travel on their own, using free dating apps such as Tinder to meet local women – mostly in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/watch-the-passport-bros-in-search-of-king-treatment-in-colombia/\">Colombia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-entrepreneur-found-dead-in-brazilian-rental-home-authorities-suspect-foul-play/\">Brazil</a> and the Dominican Republic.</p>\n\n<p>Passport bros say they travel abroad to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a64387699/what-is-a-passport-bro/\">meet women who are more traditional</a> than the ones they meet at home. Many of the American men I interviewed between 2010 and 2022 talked about Western women as too focused on career, which challenged their idea of themselves as financial providers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a black t-shirt and gray button-up rests his arm on the bar as he tries to talk to a woman in a pink top.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703700/original/file-20251120-66-sxc4hb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘Passport bros’ fly solo rather than paying for international dating services.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-shows-gesture-stop-to-man-talking-at-table-in-royalty-free-image/2153049544?phrase=man%20harassing%20women%20in%20bar&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Stanislav Smoliakov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=n2wgW2AAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">my research in Ukraine, Colombia and the Philippines</a> shows that many men using international dating services are motivated by more than just love or cultural curiosity. They are responding to a changing world in which women’s financial independence has challenged traditional male roles. For some, traveling abroad is a way to reassert control and to find <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9780814759479/love-and-empire/\">relationships that reaffirm a sense of masculine identity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my interviews, American men looking abroad talked about feeling empowered and having choices, while being ignored in the U.S. dating market. Some recognized that their relative wealth is the cause of this. As one man on a romance tour in Ukraine told me in 2012, “I am here to exchange my financial stability for some Ukrainian woman’s youth and beauty, and I am OK with that.” </p>\n\n<h2>Appeal of ‘tradition’</h2>\n\n<p>Together, many of these daters illustrate <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4149432\">the global pattern</a> I’ve seen across <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/wsq.2017.0028\">my years of fieldwork</a>: anxiety fuels a longing for traditionalism.</p>\n\n<p>What appears to be a return to the past is, in reality, an adaptation to the present. The romance tours, the “90 Day Fiance” phenomenon and the passport bros speak to how people use relationships to navigate the economic instability of the modern world. Gender roles become a way to reestablish order and identity.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, rising inflation, stagnant wages and housing shortages have left many people, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/03/us-economy-gen-z-stability-disillusion\">younger generations, feeling economically trapped</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/\">COVID-19 pandemic</a> deepened these inequalities, forcing millions out of the workforce and amplifying the strain of unpaid caregiving, particularly for women.</p>\n\n<p>In times of uncertainty, societies often retreat to familiar narratives. Traditional gender roles offer an illusion of stability and order, even if they reinforce inequality. The fantasy of the dependable male provider and the nurturing homemaker resurfaces because it seems to resolve anxieties that the modern economy has made harder to bear.</p>\n\n<p>As a sociologist, I study these dynamics not just to understand dating trends but to trace how societies reproduce inequality through intimacy. Until our society addresses stagnant wages, rising costs and the erosion of social safety nets, I believe nostalgia for a clear, gendered hierarchy will continue. In this hierarchy, men are guaranteed women’s labor, and women hold out hope for economic security – which is often seen as romance.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268616/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julia Meszaros receives funding from East Texas A&amp;M and Florida International University to support her research.

In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted an “<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html\">individualized decision-making</a>” <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-hepatitis-bvaccine-vote-delayed-parents/story?id=125731004\">approach to COVID-19 vaccination</a> instead of broadly recommending the vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not just the public that is confused. Many physicians and pharmacists also have questions about whether and how they can administer COVID-19 vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>As philosophers with <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqiUIzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">expertise in bioethics</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mbfKbrgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">legal philosophy</a>, we have been following the ethical and regulatory landscape for COVID-19 vaccines since they first became available in late 2020.</p>\n\n<p>In the fall of 2025 that landscape looks a bit different in light of the new guidelines. While it is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccines-for-kids-are-mired-in-uncertainty-amid-conflicting-federal-guidance-262685\">causing understandable confusion</a>, most people who want to get a COVID-19 vaccine can do so. Broad access is possible, in part, through what in health care is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.017\">“off-label use</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>“Off-label” refers to using an FDA-approved product for a different purpose, or with a different population, than that for which it received approval. Off-label prescriptions are common in health care, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.161.3.282\">particularly in pediatrics</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>COVID-19 vaccines from 2020-2025</h2>\n\n<p>People likely recall that COVID-19 vaccines were <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/the-fastest-vaccine-in-history\">developed faster</a> than any vaccine had been previously, thanks to efforts such as the U.S. government’s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319\">Operation Warp Speed</a>. Initially limited in supply, the vaccines first became available through “<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization\">emergency use authorization</a>” in December 2020, with health care workers among the first prioritized by the government to receive them. </p>\n\n<p>In August 2021, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-does-full-fda-approval-of-a-vaccine-do-if-its-already-authorized-for-emergency-use-165654\">FDA fully approved</a> the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine\">first COVID-19 vaccine</a> for people ages 16 and up. Following this, <a href=\"https://jha.scholasticahq.com/article/131701-advocacy-bioethics-and-regulating-covid-19-vaccines-for-children-under-5\">younger children started to become eligible for COVID-19 vaccines</a>. From 2022 through summer 2025, COVID-19 vaccines were available to everyone 6 months and older in doctors’ offices or pharmacies, mostly free of charge, albeit with <a href=\"https://www.thehastingscenter.org/covid-is-surging-most-young-children-still-are-unvaccinated\">disparities in access</a> due to an individual’s age, geographic location or vaccine costs.</p>\n\n<p>But in May 2025, the new FDA and CDC <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929\">leadership appointed by the Trump administration</a> started to <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=20\">change their agencies’ positions</a> on COVID-19 vaccines. Such regulatory changes affect who is considered eligible for the vaccines and whether public and private insurers must provide coverage. Meanwhile, state laws influence the ability of pharmacists, who frequently provide routine vaccinations, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/\">to administer COVID-19 vaccines</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding the role of federal agencies such as the FDA and the CDC, as well as medical professional organizations and guidelines, can help untangle the complicated picture for access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0inVmipMa4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Critics of the changes note that when a vaccine is available but not recommended, fewer may choose to be vaccinated and more disease may circulate unchecked in the general population.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>2025 changes to FDA and CDC guidance</h2>\n\n<p>It’s helpful to understand the process through which vaccines become approved and endorsed by government agencies in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>First, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs\">FDA approves drugs and other biologic products such as vaccines</a> for specific uses, in specific age groups – in this case, to prevent people from getting COVID-19 or, if they do get it, to reduce the severity of their symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the CDC recommends products that the FDA has approved or authorized. These <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html\">recommendations have a different regulatory function</a> than the initial FDA decisions. The CDC issues public health guidelines for which vaccines people should receive and which ones public and private insurance must cover. In some states, the CDC’s recommendations also affect whether pharmacies can administer vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>Until September 2025, when the CDC shifted its stance, the agency broadly recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone 6 months of age and older, regardless of their underlying conditions. These recommendations supported public health and ensured that public and private insurance covered 100% of the cost of these vaccines as preventive health care.</p>\n\n<h2>Medical and CDC recommendations</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the FDA’s updated eligibility criteria and the CDC’s revised guidance, medical professional organizations have <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/117383\">continued to broadly recommend COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In August, the American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx\">issued its own vaccine schedule</a>. In addition to kids who meet FDA eligibility due to heightened risk, the organization recommends that all <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pediatricians-association-recommends-covid-19-vaccines-for-toddlers-and-some-older-children-breaking-with-cdc-guidance-263522\">children between 6 months and 2 years old be vaccinated against COVID-19</a>, as well as any child whose parent or guardian wants them to be vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP – the committee that advises the CDC on vaccine policy – met in mid-September, it <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/upcoming.html\">voted to recommend that anyone 6 months and older</a> can get a COVID-19 vaccine according to “individual-based decision-making.” The committee also voted to require continued funding of COVID-19 vaccines through private and public health insurance and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html\">Vaccines for Children program</a> that provides free vaccines to children who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured or underinsured. In October, the interim CDC director <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/cdc-immunization-schedule-adopts-individual-based-decision.html\">adopted the ACIP recommendations</a> as the formal guidance from the CDC for the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>These recommendations from the CDC and medical professional organizations are difficult to square with the FDA labeling changes for COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC is recommending that people make individual decisions with their medical providers about COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of their eligibility through FDA approval. </p>\n\n<p>This is possible because anyone who doesn’t meet FDA eligibility can get a COVID-19 vaccine through off-label use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Pregnant woman holding her abdomen, getting vaccine injection in her arm from doctor syringe.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703778/original/file-20251121-56-q4gew3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still recommends that people who are pregnant get the COVID-19 vaccine.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pregnant-woman-holding-her-abdomen-getting-vaccine-royalty-free-image/1407090356?phrase=covid-19%20shots&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Olga Rolenko/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Off-label use of COVID-19 vaccines</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.3462\">Using COVID-19 vaccines off-label</a> means administering them for the same purpose but to a wider population than those who are FDA-eligible. In 2021 the CDC <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1296\">prohibited the off-label use</a> of COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the federal government. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/off-label-use-is-common-in-medicine-a-bioethicist-and-legal-philosopher-explain-why-the-covid-19-vaccines-are-different-171007\">This was an unusual move</a> and is no longer the case. </p>\n\n<p>While uncommon, off-label vaccination is sometimes recommended. One example is off-label vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, for children under 12 months old who <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html\">plan to travel</a> to areas where measles is not eradicated, or are exposed to a disease outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the CDC’s 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine recommendations remove certain barriers that typically accompany off-label use.</p>\n\n<p>For example, products used off-label are not always covered by insurance. Many private insurers <a href=\"https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage\">already committed to covering COVID-19 vaccines</a> as preventive care for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. The recommendations from ACIP and the CDC subsequently guaranteed that private and public health insurance plans would continue to <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html\">cover COVID-19 vaccines in full</a>. This includes COVID-19 vaccines under the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html\">Vaccines for Children</a> program that purchases vaccines for approximately half of U.S. children.</p>\n\n<p>Off-label use of a product is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33234538/\">ethically and legally permissible</a> if a physician believes its benefits outweigh its risks for their patient. But the CDC’s recommendation for individual decision-making may also lessen clinicians’ worries about liability. So might the guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv\">vaccine recommendations that anyone who is pregnant should get</a> an updated COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>Off-label use is typically done via a doctor’s prescription. Yet many COVID-19 vaccines are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/vaccinations-administered-pharmacies-medical.html\">administered in pharmacies</a>. Getting vaccinated in a pharmacy is especially helpful for people without primary care doctors or the time or money for a clinic visit. Many states have taken steps to remove barriers to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/these-states-are-taking-steps-to-ease-access-to-covid-19-vaccines\">obtaining off-label COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies</a>. The CDC’s October 2025 recommendations for individual decision-making also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation\">enable COVID-19 vaccination by pharmacists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For people who would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, knowing how off-label use fits into current regulations may be helpful for understanding their access to vaccines this respiratory virus season, and medical treatment in general.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268345/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

One major frustration of my work is the fact that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23556\">evidenced-based treatments</a> for obesity are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2018.10.005\">woefully underused</a></p>\n\n<p>These drugs, originally approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/drugs-that-melt-away-pounds-still-present-more-questions-than-answers-but-ozempic-wegovy-and-mounjaro-could-be-key-tools-in-reducing-the-obesity-epidemic-205549\">mimic a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1</a> that regulates  blood sugar and reduce appetite.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, by making GLP-1 drugs more accessible to patients, this agreement represents one of the most significant advances the federal government has made to address obesity, one of the country’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1477401\">most pressing public health issues</a>. However, this reduced price tag alone may not make a meaningful dent in rates of obesity in American adults without additional policy changes.</p>\n\n<h2>Treating obesity</h2>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 40% of adults in the U.S. – more than 70 million people – <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/159281\">have obesity</a>. Researchers and clinicians generally define obesity based on a measure called body mass index, or BMI, which is the ratio of a person’s weight in kilograms to their height in meters, squared. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bmi-alone-will-no-longer-be-treated-as-the-go-to-measure-for-weight-management-an-obesity-medicine-physician-explains-the-seismic-shift-taking-place-208174\">BMI is an imperfect measure</a>, to be sure,  but most medical organizations consider a person with a <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media/docs/bmi_tbl.pdf\">BMI greater than 30</a> to have obesity.</p>\n\n<p>Between television commercials, advertisements on social media and suggestions from family and friends, Americans are bombarded by approaches to losing weight. For many of these approaches, there’s little to no evidence showing they successfully help people lose weight. However, extensive and rigorous research supports the use of GLP-1s for treating obesity. Studies show that these medications can reliably <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/glp-1-drugs-effective-weight-loss-more-independent-studies-needed\">help people lose about 15% of their body weight</a> in six to 12 months. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Tuna fish salad with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, egg and pickled onion in eco paper box container.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703672/original/file-20251120-56-8wl6z8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Evidence-based approaches for weight loss include GLP-1 drugs, surgical treatment and behavior changes such as adopting a healthier diet.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/tuna-fish-salad-with-lettuce-cherry-tomatoes-royalty-free-image/2153923295\">Alexandr Kolesnikov/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There are two other evidence based-approaches. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000517\">Lifestyle changes</a>, such as consuming fewer calories and increasing physical activity, can help people lose about 5% of their weight in the same period of time. With surgical treatment, now referred to as metabolic and bariatric surgery, patients can achieve a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000550\">loss of about 30% of their body weight</a> after about 18 months.</p>\n\n<p>Which of these treatment approaches is appropriate for a given person depends on their circumstances and is best discussed with their health care provider. But in my experience, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03352-y\">too few health care professionals refer their patients</a> to any of these therapies. </p>\n\n<h2>Addressing the cost barrier</h2>\n\n<p>According to a November 2025 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-prescription-drug-costs-views-on-trump-administration-actions-and-glp-1-use/\">1 in 8 adults in the U.S. have tried a GLP-1 medication</a>. That may sound like a lot, but given that <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/159281\">more than 40% of American adults</a> have obesity, it may not be enough. </p>\n\n<p>In clinical trials, people taking GLP-1 drugs to treat obesity generally <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349\">maintained their weight loss for a year</a> if they stayed on the medication. However, participants in the trials did not have to pay for the medications. Research suggests that more than half of people using the drugs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.70058\">stop taking them after six months</a>, most often because they can’t afford them.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government’s deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/trump-medicare-coverage-weight-loss-drugs/87122843007/\">aims to address this barrier</a>. </p>\n\n<p>GLP-1 drugs currently cost more than US$1,000 per month for people unable to get them covered by health insurance – and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fewer-1-5-large-companies-health-plans-cover-weight-loss-drugs-survey-rcna174345\">many insurance plans do not</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/\">Nov. 6 White House announcement</a>, starting in early 2026, certain GLP-1 drugs covered by the agreement will be available for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/weight-loss-drugs-medicare-deals\">$350 per month or less</a> through an online marketplace the government plans to launch.</p>\n\n<p>Some drugs will be as cheap as $150, according to the announcement. Companies will also drop the amount that Medicare and Medicaid pay for them, and certain Medicare patients would be able to access them with a $50 co-pay. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/17/novo-nordisk-cuts-prices-ozempic-wegovy/87269159007/\">These prices are still in flux</a>, news reports suggest. However, for most Americans, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/trump-medicare-coverage-weight-loss-drugs/87122843007/\">paying even $150 a month</a> for a single medication remains a budget buster. That’s especially true given that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00398-7\">people from lower socioeconomic groups</a> experience higher rates of obesity and often have other related health conditions that require costly medications.</p>\n\n<p>These costs are not temporary. Most patients with obesity and related health problems will likely need to use these medications indefinitely. According to emerging research, people who stop taking them typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14725\">regain the weight they lost</a>. Realistically, very few people who take GLP-1 drugs can maintain their weight loss with lifestyle changes alone.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pile of injectors for GLP-1 weight loss drugs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703669/original/file-20251120-56-9144jc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=603&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Studies suggest that patients who use GLP-1 drugs for weight loss will likely have to use them indefinitely.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/large-group-of-injectors-dosing-pens-for-royalty-free-image/2025837738\">aprott/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Beyond cost</h2>\n\n<p>The reduced pricing for GLP-1 drugs is an important first step in increasing affordability and access to these treatments. Given that the food environments people live in make it difficult to make healthy choices, I believe that this move will only meaningfully benefit the health of all Americans if it is combined with other policy changes.</p>\n\n<p>While several countries have a <a href=\"https://impact.economist.com/health/obesity-response-index/global\">national plan to prevent and treat obesity</a>, the U.S. does not. Instead, American public health policies are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.621\">largely set state by state</a>. They often include strategies such as free school meals for children or more robust insurance coverage for treating obesity and related health conditions. However, most such policies are often too narrow to have significant benefits at the population level. </p>\n\n<p>Broader policy shifts and legislation targeting obesity prevention could move the needle. </p>\n\n<p>For example, research is increasingly showing that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-024-00517-z\">ultraprocessed foods</a> play a role in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food\">promoting weight gain</a> and potentially other diseases, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.4777\">colorectal cancer</a>. Legislators could draw on that research to better regulate these foods – for example, to limit the use of certain especially harmful ingredients, to restrict marketing of ultraprocessed products, or to limit their inclusion in school meals.</p>\n\n<p>Another policy change that may help would be to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1205880\">build more extensive nutrition education</a> into the training that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/diet-related-diseases-are-the-no-1-cause-of-death-in-the-us-yet-many-doctors-receive-little-to-no-nutrition-education-in-med-school-236217\">medical students</a> and other health care providers receive. This may better position the next generation of clinicians to help their patients make the healthiest choices to maintain their weight and health.  </p>\n\n<p>These and other policy changes will be critically important in efforts to reduce the rate of obesity among Americans in the future.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269361/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David B.

      "content": "<p>In late October 2025, as much as <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/ludicrous-usd6-billion-counter-strike-2-skins-market-crashes-loses-usd3-billion-overnight-game-update-destroys-inventories-collapses-market\">US$2 billion</a> vanished from a digital marketplace. This wasn’t a hack or a bubble bursting. It happened because one company, Valve, <a href=\"https://www.kvue.com/article/news/nation-world/counter-strike-2-online-market-crash/507-ae9be038-2833-49d4-a5b4-d8f24fd0b33c\">changed the rules for its video game</a> Counter-Strike 2, a popular first-person shooter with a global player base of nearly <a href=\"https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2\">30 million monthly users</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For years, its players have bought, sold and traded digital cosmetic items, known as “skins.” Some rare items, particularly knives and gloves, commanded high prices in real-world money – <a href=\"https://skinswap.com/blog/en/cs2/the-most-expensive-knife/\">up to $1.5 million</a> – leading some gamers to treat the market like an <a href=\"https://blix.gg/news/cs-2/how-to-make-money-with-cs2-skins-in-2025/\">investment portfolio</a>. As a result, many investment-style analytics websites charge monthly fees for financial insight, trends and transaction data from this digital marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>In one fell swoop, Valve unilaterally changed the game. It expanded the “<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662005\">trade up contract</a>,” allowing players to exchange – or “trade up” – a number of their common assets into knives or gloves.</p>\n\n<p>By flipping this switch, Valve instantly upended digital scarcity. The market was flooded with new supply, and the value of existing high-end items collapsed. Prices plummeted, initially erasing half the market’s total value, which exceeded $6 billion before the recent crash. Although a partial recovery brought the net loss to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/counter-strike-2-update-market-crash-2-billion-dollars/\">roughly 25%</a>, significant volatility continues, leaving investors unsure whether the bottom has truly fallen out.</p>\n\n<p>Many of those who saw their digital fortunes evaporate immediately wondered whether there was anything they could do to get their money back. Speaking as a <a href=\"https://law.indiana.edu/about/people/details?name=marinotti-jo%C3%A3o\">law professor</a> and a gamer myself, the answer isn’t what they want to hear: no. In fact, the existing legal structure largely protects Valve’s ability to engage in this sort of digital market manipulation. Players and investors were simply out of luck. </p>\n\n<p>The Counter-Strike 2 crash reveals a troubling reality that extends far beyond video games: Corporations have built exchange-scale investment markets governed primarily by private terms-of-service agreements, rather than the robust set of public regulations that oversee traditional financial and consumer markets. These digital economies occupy a legal blind spot, lacking the fundamental guardrails of property rights, meaningful consumer protection or even securities regulation.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIdspVpmeLg?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Buyers’ guides like this one have cropped up on YouTube.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Your digital ‘property’ isn’t really yours</h2>\n\n<p>If you spend real money on a digital item, it may feel like you should own it. Legally, you don’t.</p>\n\n<p>The digital economy is built on a crucial distinction between ownership and licensing. When users sign up for Steam, Valve’s platform, they agree to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251109151751/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/\">Steam subscriber agreement</a>. Buried in that contract is a critical piece of legalese stating that all digital assets and services provided by Valve, including the Counter-Strike 2 skins, are merely “licensed, not sold.” The license granted to users “confers no title or ownership” at all. This isn’t meaningless corporate jargon; it’s a legal standard <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol54/iss1/2/\">routinely affirmed</a> by U.S. courts.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implication is clear: Because players only license their skins, they have no property rights over them. When Valve changed the game’s mechanics in a way that collapsed the items’ market value, it didn’t steal, damage or destroy anyone’s “property.” In the eyes of the law, Valve simply altered the conditions of a license, something that its terms-of-service agreement allows it to do unilaterally, at any time, for any reason.</p>\n\n<h2>Consumer protection laws don’t apply</h2>\n\n<p>While the Counter-Strike 2 crash may seem like a violation of consumer rights, current laws are ill-equipped to handle this type of corporate behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have begun addressing concerns about digital goods, primarily focusing on instances where purchased movies or games disappear entirely from user libraries. For example, California recently enacted <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB2426/id/3022416\">AB 2426</a>. This law requires transparency, prohibiting terms like “buy” or “purchase” unless the consumer confirms that they understand they will receive only a revocable license.</p>\n\n<p>As commendable as this law is, it protects only against confusion and loss of access, not loss of market value when platforms rebalance virtual economies. Valve can comply with consumer transparency laws and still adjust the supply of digital items, rendering them valueless overnight. Ultimately, current consumer protection laws are designed to ensure users know what they are licensing. They do not, however, create ownership interests or protect the speculative value of those digital items.</p>\n\n<h2>Game items are treated like unregulated stocks</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most significant legal vacuum is the absence of financial regulation. The Counter-Strike 2 economy, a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/market-for-counter-strike-2-digital-items-hits-all-time-high\">multibillion-dollar ecosystem</a> with <a href=\"https://cs2fund.com/top-investors/\">dedicated investors</a> and <a href=\"https://totalcsgo.com/skins/skin-trading-sites\">third-party cash markets</a>, looks and behaves like a traditional financial market. Yet, it remains outside the purview of any financial regulator, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Under U.S. law, the primary standard for determining whether an asset should be governed as a security is the Howey test. According to this <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/293/\">Supreme Court precedent</a>, an asset is a security if it meets four criteria. Securities involve an “investment of money” in a “common enterprise” with a reasonable expectation of “profits” derived from the “efforts of others.” </p>\n\n<p>Counter-Strike 2 skins arguably meet all of these criteria. Participants invest real money in a common enterprise – Valve’s platform – with an expectation of profit. Crucially, that profit depends on the “efforts of others.” The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/divisions-offices/division-corporation-finance/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\">SEC notes</a> this prong is met when a promoter provides “essential managerial efforts” that affect the enterprise’s success. Valve controls the game’s development, manages the platform and – as the recent update proves – dictates item supply and scarcity.</p>\n\n<p>If a publicly traded company unilaterally changed its rules in a way that predictably tanked the price of its own shares, regulators would immediately investigate for market manipulation. So how can Valve get away with this? Three things cut against the skins’ status as securities. </p>\n\n<p>First is their “consumptive intent” – skins are primarily game cosmetics. Second, there’s no way to convert the skins into dollars within Valve’s own ecosystem. In other words, third-party markets allow users to cash out, but these markets operate outside Valve’s own immediate control. And finally, the Howey test generally governs assets, such as stocks and bonds, that grant investors enforceable rights. Valve’s licensing scheme attempts to circumvent this by ensuring players hold nothing but a revocable license.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the $2 billion crash is a wake-up call. As digital economies grow in financial significance, society must decide: Will these markets continue to be governed solely by private corporate contracts? Or will they require integration into more robust legal frameworks, such as securities regulation, consumer protection and property law?</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268749/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>João Marinotti does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

During his dramatic testimony, Lawson proclaimed his intent “to fight for the Bill of Rights,” which he argued the committee “was trying to destroy.”</p>\n\n<p>They were <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/24/the-day-in-politics-nov-24-1947-259367?_amp=true\">all cited for contempt of Congress</a>. Eight were sentenced to a year in federal prison, and two received six-month terms. Upon their release, they <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/blacklists/\">faced blacklisting in the industry</a>. Some, like writer Dalton Trumbo, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240613-i-went-spectacularly-broke-the-blacklisted-hollywood-writer-who-won-two-oscars\">temporarily left the country</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bcwVQdgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">researcher focused on the cultural cold war</a>, I have examined the role the First Amendment played in the anti-communist hearings during the 1940s and ’50s. </p>\n\n<p>The conviction and incarceration of the Hollywood Ten left a <a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/congcomms.html\">chilling effect on subsequent witnesses</a> called to appear before congressional committees. It also established a period of repression historians now refer to as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.013.6\">Second Red Scare</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Although the freedom of speech is enshrined in the Constitution and prized by Americans, the story of the Second Red Scare shows that this freedom is even more fragile than it may now seem.</p>\n\n<h2>The Fifth Amendment communists</h2>\n\n<p>After the 1947 hearings, the term “<a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/congcomms.html\">unfriendly</a>” became a label applied by the House Un-American Activities Committee and the press to the Hollywood Ten and any witnesses who refused to cooperate with the committee. These witnesses, who wanted to avoid the fate of the Hollywood Ten, began to shift away from the First Amendment as a legal strategy. </p>\n\n<p>They chose instead to plead the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/\">Fifth Amendment</a>, which grants people the right to protect themselves from self-incrimination. Many prominent artists during the 1950s, including playwright <a href=\"https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_8006316.pdf\">Lillian Hellman</a> and singer and activist <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/75-years-ago-the-kkk-and-anti-communists-teamed-up-to-violently-stop-a-folk-concert-in-ny-236094\">Paul Robeson</a>, opted to invoke the Fifth when called before the committee and asked about their political affiliations.  </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/house-un-american-activities-committee/\">Fifth Amendment shielded hundreds</a> of “unfriendly” witnesses from imprisonment, including artists, teachers and federal workers. However, it did not save them from <a href=\"https://writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/50s/schrecker-blacklist.html\">job loss and blacklisting</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While they could avoid contempt citations by pleading the Fifth, they could not erase the stain of perceived guilt. This legal approach became so widespread that <a href=\"https://www2.gwu.edu/%7Eerpapers/mep/displaydoc.cfm?docid=erpn-josmcc\">U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy</a>, the country’s leading anti-communist crusader, disparaged these witnesses as “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/mccarthy-more-than-just-a-man/\">Fifth Amendment Communists</a>” and boasted of purging their ranks from the federal government. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three photos of a man in suit and tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=347&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702557/original/file-20251114-76-img7pw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Three portraits of Albert Einstein taken in Princeton, N.J., in March 1953.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/USASCIENCEALBERTEINSTEIN/cd78c06cede2da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From Fifth back to First</h2>\n\n<p>In 1953, the physicist Albert Einstein became instrumental in <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/albert-einstein/\">revitalizing the force of the First Amendment</a> as a rhetorical and legal tactic in the congressional hearings. Having fled Germany after the Nazis came to power, Einstein took a position at Princeton in 1933 and became an important voice in American politics.</p>\n\n<p>Einstein’s philosophical battle against McCarthyism began with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/19/archives/teacher-advised-by-einstein-is-out-brooklyn-man-instructed-not-to.html\">a letter to a Brooklyn high school teacher</a> named William Frauenglass. </p>\n\n<p>In April of that year, Frauenglass was subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, “<a href=\"https://libguides.ecu.edu/c.php?g=17484&amp;p=97626\">the Senate counterpart</a>” of the House Un-American Activities Committee, to testify about his involvement in an intercultural education seminar. After the hearing, in which Frauenglass declined to speak about his political affiliations, he risked potential termination from his position and wrote to Einstein seeking support. </p>\n\n<p>In his response, Einstein urged Frauenglass and all intellectuals to enact a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">revolutionary” form of complete “noncooperation</a>” with the committee.</p>\n\n<p>While Einstein advised noncompliance, he also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">acknowledged the potential risk</a>: “Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify, i.e., he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country.”</p>\n\n<p>Frauenglass shared his story with the press, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/12/archives/-refuse-to-testify-einstein-advises-intellectuals-called-in-by.html\">Einstein’s letter was published in full</a> in The New York Times on June 12, 1953. It was also quoted in local papers around the country. </p>\n\n<p>One week later, Frauenglass was fired from his job.</p>\n\n<p>After learning about Einstein’s public position, McCarthy labeled the Nobel laureate “<a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2017/einstein-mccarthyism\">an enemy of America</a>.” That didn’t stop Einstein’s campaign for freedom of expression. He continued to encourage witnesses to rely on the First Amendment. </p>\n\n<p>When the engineer <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,858395-2,00.html\">Albert Shadowitz received a subpoena in 1953</a> to appear before McCarthy’s Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, to answer questions about alleged ties to the Communist Party, he traveled to Einstein’s home to seek out the physicist’s advice. After consulting with Einstein, Shadowitz opted for the First Amendment over the Fifth Amendment. </p>\n\n<p>On Dec. 16, 1953, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Proceedings_Against_Albert_Shadowitz_for/hvNapASYWBkC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">Shadowitz informed the committee</a> that he had received counsel from Einstein. He then voiced his opposition to the hearing on the grounds of the First Amendment: “I will refuse to answer any question which invades my rights to think as I please or which violates my guarantees of free speech and association.”</p>\n\n<p>He was cited for contempt in August 1954 and indicted that November, facing a potential year in prison and US$1,000 fine. As an indicator of McCarthy’s diminishing power, the charge was thrown out in July 1955 by a federal judge.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Black man sits in front of a table with a microphone on it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=470&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702947/original/file-20251117-56-tmv9wk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Singer Paul Robeson appears before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C., in 1956.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/singer-paul-robeson-is-shown-as-he-appeared-before-the-news-photo/515025440?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Bettmann Archive/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The triumph of dissent</h2>\n\n<p>Well-known public figures also began to turn away from the Fifth Amendment as a legal tactic and to draw on the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>In August 1955, when the <a href=\"https://peteseeger.org/\">folk musician Pete Seeger</a> testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he voiced his rejection of the Fifth Amendment defense during the hearing. Seeger asserted that he wanted to use his testimony to call into question the nature of the inquiry altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Pleading the protection of the First Amendment, <a href=\"https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6457/\">Seeger refused</a> “to answer any questions” related to his “political beliefs” and instead interrogated the committee’s right to ask such questions “under such compulsion as this.”</p>\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/excerpts-from-arthur-millers-testimony-before-the-house-un-american-activities-committee/14006/\">playwright Arthur Miller</a> was subpoenaed by the committee in 1956, he also refused to invoke the Fifth. Both were cited for contempt. Seeger was sentenced to a year in prison. Miller was given the option to pay a $500 dollar fine or spend 30 days in jail.</p>\n\n<p>As Seeger and Miller fought their appeals in court, McCarthy’s popularity continued to wane, and public sentiment began to shift. </p>\n\n<p>Prompted by Einstein, the noncompliant witnesses in the 1950s reshaped the public discussion, refocusing the conversation on the importance of freedom of expression rather than the fears of imagined communist infiltration. </p>\n\n<p>Although the First Amendment failed to keep the Hollywood Ten out of prison, it ultimately prevailed. Unlike the Hollywood Ten, both Miller and Seeger won their appeals. Miller spent no time in prison and Seeger only one day in jail. Miller’s conviction was reversed in 1958, Seeger’s in 1962. The Second Red Scare was over. </p>\n\n<p>As the Second Red Scare shows, when free speech is under attack, strategic compliance may be useful for individuals. However, bold and courageous acts of dissent are critical for protecting First Amendment rights for everyone.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267809/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I met Pete Seeger personally while directing a documentary film about his environmental legacy. </span></em></p>",

Through three elections, <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/11/13/trump-election-farming-counties-trade-war/\">farmers stood by Trump</a> even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.</p>\n\n<p>But Trump’s second term may be different.</p>\n\n<p>A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods – not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive – through renewed <a href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/lower-tariffs-take-effect-under-new-china-trade-deal\">tariffs on agricultural products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/potential-implications-of-immigration-restrictions-on-the-u-s-agricultural-workforce/\">visa restrictions on farm workers</a>, <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2025/04/04/small-farms/\">reduced farm subsidies</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/misguided-cattlemens-trade-group-raises-alarm-trump-plan/story?id=126792026\">open favoritism</a> toward South American agricultural competitors.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018–19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqae141\">farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans</a> even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/most-us-farmers-remain-loyal-to-trump-despite-pain-from-trade-wars-and-covid-19-146535\">political belief outweighed market logic</a> – at least in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper – and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.</p>\n\n<h2>Tariffs: The familiar pain returns</h2>\n\n<p>The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-suspends-soybean-imports-three-us-firms-halts-log-imports-2025-03-04/\">Beijing suspended import licenses</a> for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.</p>\n\n<p>An October 2025 deal promised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-vows-boost-us-farm-trade-leaves-details-unclear-2025-10-30/\">China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans</a> a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic. </p>\n\n<p>Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports.

As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=z_A4SqoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">researchers studying</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=c3Iu5qsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">how AI affects emotions</a> and relationships in the workplace, we are concerned with critical questions that this shift raises: What happens when your employer has access to your emotional data? Can AI really provide the kind of emotional support workers need? What happens if the AI malfunctions? And if something goes wrong, who’s responsible?</p>\n\n<h2>The workplace difference</h2>\n\n<p>Many companies have started by offering automated counseling programs that have many parallels with personal therapy apps, a practice that has shown some benefits. In preliminary studies, researchers found that in a doctor-patient-style virtual conversation setting, AI-generated responses actually <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838\">make people feel more heard</a> than human ones. A study comparing AI chatbots with human psychotherapists found the bots were “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12832\">at least as empathic as therapist responses, and sometimes more so</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>This might seem surprising at first glance, but AI offers unwavering attention and consistently supportive responses. It doesn’t interrupt, doesn’t judge and doesn’t get frustrated when you repeat the same concerns. For some employees, especially those dealing with stigmatized issues like mental health or workplace conflicts, this consistency <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.043\">feels safer than human interaction</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But for others, it raises new concerns. A 2023 study found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1219229\">workers were reluctant to participate</a> in company-initiated mental health programs due to worries about confidentiality and stigma. Many feared that their disclosures could negatively affect their careers.</p>\n\n<p>Other workplace AI systems go much deeper, analyzing employee communication as it happens – think emails, Slack conversations and Zoom calls. This analysis creates detailed records of employee emotional states, stress patterns and psychological vulnerabilities. All this data resides within corporate systems where privacy protections are typically unclear and often favor the interests of the employer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"illustration of a giant eyeball watching a woman working on a computer at a desk\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703512/original/file-20251119-56-97koy3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=528&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Employees might feel that AI emotional support systems are more like workplace surveillance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/large-blue-eyeball-watching-businesswoman-royalty-free-illustration/2169079877\">Malte Mueller/fStop via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Workplace Options, a global employee assistance provider, has partnered with Wellbeing.ai to <a href=\"https://www.workplaceoptions.com/news/workplace-options-partnership-with-wellbeing-ai-deepens-human-connection-via-evidence-based-neuroscience/\">deploy a platform that uses facial analytics</a> to track emotional states across 62 emotion categories. It generates well-being scores that organizations can use to detect stress or morale issues. This approach effectively embeds AI into emotionally sensitive aspects of work, leaving an uncomfortably thin boundary between support and surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>In this scenario, the same AI that helps employees feel heard and supported also generates unprecedented insight into workforce emotional dynamics. Organizations can now track which departments show signs of burnout, identify employees at risk of quitting and monitor emotional responses to organizational changes.</p>\n\n<p>But this type of tool also transforms emotional data into management intelligence, presenting many companies with a genuine dilemma. While progressive organizations are establishing strict data governance – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3610207\">limiting access to anonymized patterns</a> rather than individual conversations – others struggle with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580950\">the temptation to use emotional insights</a> for performance evaluation and personnel decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous surveillance carried out by some of these systems may help ensure that companies do not neglect a group or individual in distress, but it can also lead people to monitor their own actions to avoid calling attention to themselves. Research on workplace AI monitoring has shown how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12514\">employees experience increased stress and modify their behavior</a> when they know that management can review their interactions. The monitoring undermines the feeling of safety necessary for people to comfortably seek help. Another study found that these systems <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23294965241228874\">increased distress for employees</a> due to the loss of privacy and concerns that consequences would arise if the system identified them as being stressed or burned out. </p>\n\n<h2>When artificial empathy meets real consequences</h2>\n\n<p>These findings are important because the stakes are arguably even higher in workplace settings than personal ones. AI systems lack the nuanced judgment necessary to distinguish between accepting someone as a person versus endorsing harmful behaviors. In organizational contexts, this means an AI might inadvertently validate unethical workplace practices or fail to recognize when human intervention is critical. </p>\n\n<p>And that’s not the only way AI systems can get things wrong. A study found that emotion-tracking AI tools had a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emotion-tracking-ai-on-the-job-workers-fear-being-watched-and-misunderstood-222592\">disproportionate impact</a> on employees of color, trans and gender nonbinary people, and people living with mental illness. Interviewees <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/emotion-tracking-ai-on-the-job-workers-fear-being-watched-and-misunderstood-222592\">expressed deep concern</a> about how these tools might misread an employee’s mood, tone or verbal queues due to ethnic, gender and other kinds of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/forget-dystopian-scenarios-ai-is-pervasive-today-and-the-risks-are-often-hidden-218222\">bias that AI systems carry</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q29YVnHqEt0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A study looked at how employees perceive AI emotion detection in the workplace.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There’s also an authenticity problem. Research shows that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2024.100745\">when people know they’re talking to an AI system</a>, they rate identical empathetic responses as less authentic than when they attribute them to humans. Yet some employees prefer AI precisely because they know it’s not human. The feeling that these tools protect your anonymity and freedom from social consequences is appealing for some – even if it may only be a feeling.</p>\n\n<p>The technology also raises questions about what happens to human managers. If employees consistently prefer AI for emotional support, what does that reveal about organizational leadership? Some companies are <a href=\"https://pandatron.ai/ai-in-leadership-development-the-next-frontier/\">using AI insights to train managers</a> in emotional intelligence, turning the technology into a mirror that reflects where human skills fall short.</p>\n\n<h2>The path forward</h2>\n\n<p>The conversation about workplace AI emotional support isn’t just about technology – it’s about what kinds of companies people want to work for. As these systems become more prevalent, we believe it’s important to grapple with fundamental questions: Should employers prioritize authentic human connection over consistent availability? How can individual privacy be balanced with organizational insights? Can organizations harness AI’s empathetic capabilities while preserving the trust necessary for meaningful workplace relationships?</p>\n\n<p>The most thoughtful implementations recognize that AI shouldn’t replace human empathy, but rather create conditions where it can flourish. When AI handles routine emotional labor – the 3 a.m. anxiety attacks, pre-meeting stress checks, processing difficult feedback – managers gain bandwidth for deeper, more authentic connections with their teams.</p>\n\n<p>But this requires careful implementation. Companies that establish clear ethical boundaries, strong privacy protections and explicit policies about how emotional data gets used are more likely to avoid the pitfalls of these systems – as will those that recognize when human judgment and authentic presence remain irreplaceable.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266570/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Chances are you have some in a jar, or scattered among pockets, purses and car ashtrays.</p>\n\n<p>As small as it is, the penny punches above its weight culturally. If it ever disappeared, so too might the simple kindness of “<a href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/take-a-penny-leave-a-penny-day/\">take a penny, leave a penny</a>,” alongside <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html\">timeless classics like penny loafers</a> and the tradition of tossing a penny in a fountain.</p>\n\n<p>But the penny’s days are indeed numbered. The U.S. Mint <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380\">pressed the last 1-cent coin on Nov. 12</a>, 2025, following a directive from the White House. While pennies will remain legal tender, old ones will gradually be taken out of circulation.</p>\n\n<p>The impact of this change will reach beyond coin jars. Its ripples will be felt as small, cash-reliant Main Street merchants face another test of adaptability in a system that increasingly favors scale, technology and plastic. It will also be felt by people who rely on cash – often people <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-08/cash-only.pdf\">without bank accounts</a> who have the least room to absorb even tiny shifts in price. </p>\n\n<p>My interest comes from my former lives as the chief financial officer of a large credit union and as a small-business owner. Now, I bridge theory and practice as a professor – or “prac-ademic,” as I like to say – <a href=\"https://web.uri.edu/business/meet/nancy-forster-holt/\">studying the challenges facing Main Street businesses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the penny goes away, some will win, some will lose – and for some, it’ll be a coin toss. </p>\n\n<h2>Heads, they win</h2>\n\n<p>The first and most obvious winner is the U.S. government, which will save <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/penny-out-of-circulation-mint-rcna243486\">tens of millions of dollars each year</a> by no longer minting a coin that costs more to make than it’s worth. Ending production seems like an easy call for efficiency’s sake.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/banking-trends-strategies/what-bankers-should-think-about-the-end-of-the-u-s-penny-192144\">Banks and credit unions</a> will likely benefit too. Pennies are disproportionately expensive to handle: Every bag of pennies gets counted, sorted, rolled, verified and shipped back to the Federal Reserve, generating labor and equipment costs that <a href=\"https://us.brinks.com/-/the-true-costs-of-manual-cash-management-1\">far exceed the coin’s value</a>. Removing the smallest denomination strips out an entire layer of cost and friction from bank operations – savings that scale immediately across thousands of branches.</p>\n\n<p>Another beneficiary, this one hiding in plain sight, is who transports the cash: the <a href=\"https://www.readycreditcorp.com/resources/blog/the-penny-is-disappearing-and-so-are-the-profits-of-handling-cash/\">armored-carrier industry</a>. For companies such as Loomis and Brink’s, pennies are heavy, low-value cargo, and a logistical money-loser. Removing penny pickups eliminates one of their most inefficient services, reducing fuel use, labor hours and truck wear. </p>\n\n<p>Large retailers will likely also win. Size and scale make it easier to undertake <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/penny-circulation-retailers-change.html\">preparations both big and small</a>, such as reprogramming cash registers and stockpiling pennies to hedge against shortages. Larger companies also have the talent and bandwidth to <a href=\"https://www.ihlservices.com/product/the-cost-of-cash-handling\">figure out the true costs and benefits</a> of accepting cash or noncash payments. If most of their transactions are <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/retailers-return-on-store-tech-investments/805305/\">already digital</a>, they could be relatively indifferent to the end of the penny.</p>\n\n<p>Large retailers also negotiate <a href=\"https://goftx.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees-guide/\">lower card processing rates</a>, which are the fees <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">merchants must pay to the card companies</a> every time a customer uses a credit or debit card. These rates aren’t uniform: Large chains get discounted pricing <a href=\"https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/can-a-large-merchants-negotiate-lower-payment-processing-rates/\">based on sales volume</a>, while small businesses face higher costs for identical transactions. It follows that any policy change leading to more people paying with plastic will disproportionately benefit larger retailers.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, some banks, credit unions and large retailers have <a href=\"https://massmarketretailers.com/retailers-facing-penny-shortages-call-for-federal-action/\">expressed concern and surprise</a> at the pace of the change and the lack of guidance from the federal government. But for most, the penny’s end is a minor operational footnote. Online-only businesses operate in this frictionless world as well – no coins, no counting, no issue.</p>\n\n<h2>Tails, they lose</h2>\n\n<p>For small, Main Street businesses, the penny’s disappearance highlights the structural disadvantages they already face – and I think it will force a reckoning about what types of payments benefit their bottom lines.</p>\n\n<p>As pennies phase out, local businesses are likely to round cash transactions to the nearest 5 cents, resulting in what economists call a “<a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-27\">rounding tax</a>.” Rounding to the nearest nickel could cost businesses and consumers about $6 million annually, according to researchers with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.</p>\n\n<p>And it wouldn’t offer much relief if more shoppers turn to plastic and other noncash payments. That’s because most small merchants lack the negotiating power to lower their <a href=\"https://goftx.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees-guide/\">card-processing fees</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Card acceptance comes with a layered stack of costs for merchants: interchange fees, network assessments, processor markups, gateway fees, chargeback penalties, terminal rentals and more. Together, these average <a href=\"https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/can-a-large-merchants-negotiate-lower-payment-processing-rates/\">2.5% to 3.5% per sale for many small businesses</a>. Also, there are expenses related to adopting the latest, greatest payment methods, and then keeping them updated.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a quick-service restaurant where a typical customer spends $14. If that customer pays with a credit card and the business pays an <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/2024/making-sense-of-the-cost-of-cash-for-businesses/\">average processing fee</a> of 2.2% plus 10 cents per transaction, each sale incurs about 41 cents in fees. Even low-cost debit cards include fixed per-transaction charges that disproportionately affect businesses when the per-sale average is small. When the average sale is $10 or less, it <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">barely covers the cost</a> to process it as a card transaction. </p>\n\n<p>That said, handling cash also comes at a cost, and <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-hidden-costs-of-cash\">it’s not always easy</a> <a href=\"https://www.ihlservices.com/product/the-cost-of-cash-handling\">to know what’s best for business</a>. One analysis found that accepting cash <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/fed-notes/2019/08/cash-me-if-you-can-impacts-of-cashless-businesses-on-retailers-consumers-cash-use/\">costs 53 cents per $100 of sales</a>, compared with $1.12 for accepting debit payments using a signature and 81 cents for PIN-based debit. Of course, businesses also should keep in mind that different customers will have different payment preferences.</p>\n\n<p>And speaking of customers, those who are most likely to feel the pinch from the end of the penny are people who still rely on cash: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/health/elderly-cash-electronic-payments.html\">older adults</a>, lower-income households, people without credit cards or bank accounts – <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-08/cash-only.pdf\">either unbanked or under-banked</a> – and people who budget in cash because it provides firmer spending discipline. </p>\n\n<p>A few cents added to a grocery total or a convenience store purchase may not matter to someone tapping a rewards credit card, but cash-dependent consumers experience those small increases directly, with no offsetting points, perks or end-of-month cash back. And yes, prices often end in 99 cents, which get <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/blogs/macroblog/2025/11/03/rounding-rules-and-cash-inflation-when-we-no-longer-make-cents\">rounded up, not down</a>. So the burden falls disproportionately on those least equipped to absorb even small, cumulative increases. </p>\n\n<h2>For some, it’s a coin toss</h2>\n\n<p>Digital-first consumers may barely notice the penny’s disappearance. They tap phones, scan QR codes and use payment apps that will still <a href=\"https://www.windriverpayments.com/how-will-discontinuing-the-penny-affect-my-business-and-payment-processing\">settle to the exact amount</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While businesses haven’t received final guidance on how to handle payments in the post-penny era, <a href=\"https://www.windriverpayments.com/how-will-discontinuing-the-penny-affect-my-business-and-payment-processing/\">one option</a> is to price electronic transactions to the cent and round cash transactions to the nearest nickel. If that were widely adopted, digital payments alone would remain precise.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers who use cashless payments may believe their choice doesn’t affect how they shop, but behavioral research says otherwise. <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/experts/how-credit-cards-activate-reward-center-our-brains-and-drive-spending\">Credit cards reduce the “pain of paying,”</a> leading people to spend more – often 10% to 20% more than with cash. Credit card rewards programs further incentivize card use. In one last nod to the cost of noncash payments, those rewards are funded by higher merchant fees that ultimately <a href=\"https://www.posnation.com/blog/passing-credit-card-fees-customers\">translate into higher retail prices</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Killing the penny makes economic sense for the government and some businesses, yet it also highlights a deeper truth: Efficiency tends to reward the already efficient. For many, however, even when the change is small, every cent still counts.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267380/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nancy Forster-Holt does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But the University of Michigan’s healthy minds survey, the <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/news/2025posts/college-student-mental-health-third-consecutive-year-improvement.html\">country’s largest student mental health study</a> to date, recently found that college students are reporting lower rates of depressive symptoms, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for the third year in a row.</p>\n\n<p>Conducted in 2024 and 2025 and surveying more than 84,000 students across 135 American colleges and universities, the study finds that <a href=\"https://healthymindsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-2025_HMS-National-Data-Report_Student.pdf\">severe depression symptoms</a> among college students dropped in the past two years to 18% – down from 23% who said they experienced severe depression in 2022. Students who have suicidal thoughts dropped from 15% in 2022 to 11% during 2024 and 2025.</p>\n\n<p>I have worked in student affairs and college health for the past 25 years, leading substance abuse prevention and mental health promotion efforts, and overseeing a range of clinical services.

Understanding the root causes of students’ stress is an important precursor for schools to come up with effective ways to help students manage their anxiety and succeed in school. </p>\n\n<p>But even when schools offer extensive mental health support programs, students occasionally need to take a break to focus on their health and well-being. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past 10 years, I have reviewed and approved medical withdrawals for 133 students at Babson College. From fall 2015 to early spring 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, an average of 12 students per year left on medical leave out of the nearly 4,000 students enrolled at the school. </p>\n\n<p>The average number of students taking medical leave then increased by about two people a year from fall 2020 through 2025. Approximately 82% of these cases are mental health-related.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly 70% of these students ultimately return to campus and eventually graduate. In general, very few students who take a leave of absence from school end up returning. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are some schools that use proactive, nondisciplinary policies to support students taking a break to pursue more intensive treatment. These policies can provide clear treatment recommendations and instructions on what conditions students need to be met in order to return to school, resulting in a higher likelihood of the students enrolling once again. </p>\n\n<h2>Understanding well-being</h2>\n\n<p>Well-being is a word that is top of mind for many higher education leaders, yet colleges and universities do not have a single <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1763369\">definition of what well-being</a> means, though it is often a term schools use to talk about students’ mental health. Well-being <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-for-happiness/201901/what-is-well-being-definition-types-and-well-being-skills\">generally encompasses</a> acknowledging and being comfortable with your feelings, and being equipped to manage stress. </p>\n\n<p>While there is movement toward embedding student mental health and well-being into the very fabric of an institution, many colleges and universities still rely on reaching students in more <a href=\"https://publichealthnotes.com/different-methods-of-health-education/\">traditional ways</a> – through health fairs and information tables in the student center, for example. </p>\n\n<p>While these strategies certainly serve a purpose in helping to raise awareness of mental health resources, when used in isolation, they are unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/collegeaim\">result in actual behavioral change</a> among students.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/611093/black-hispanic-students-greatest-risk-leaving-program.aspx\">Students of color</a>, particularly Black and Latino students, are more likely than white students to temporarily withdraw from college. </p>\n\n<p>One step institutions can take: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1429788\">Hire more faculty, staff and mental health counselors</a> who are people of color and can better connect with minority students through shared lived experiences.  </p>\n\n<h2>Well-being is central to students’ success</h2>\n\n<p>In 2007, an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech University <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/mass-shootings-virginia-tech-april-16-2007-report-review-panel\">shot and killed 32 people</a>, and wounded 17 others, before he died by suicide. </p>\n\n<p>Schools since then have adopted early alert systems – often referred to as <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/health-and-wellness/babson-cares/\">care teams</a> – to help identify students who are struggling, either academically, socially or emotionally. The idea is that schools can intervene and get students connected with campus resources such as academic advisers, student success coaches, accessibility services, financial aid and mental health support. </p>\n\n<p>Ongoing training for faculty, staff and students on how to activate these systems of support and make referrals to a care team is critical to their success. The goal is to cast a wide net so students do not fall through the cracks and go unnoticed when they are not mentally well, which is what happened <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/us/20vtech.html\">with the Virginia Tech shooter</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.masters-in-psychology.net/30-colleges-leading-the-way-in-meditation-for-mental-health/\">Dozens of campuses</a>, including New York University, Indiana State University, the University of North Dakota, The Ohio State University and Harvard University, have also embraced mindfulness practices in recent years, offering breath work and other forms of meditation for their students as free services on campus. </p>\n\n<p>Some campus police departments <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.babson.edu/babson-community-resource-dog/\">have also begun using therapy dogs</a> to help support students’ mental health and bolster community engagement. </p>\n\n<p>Other schools, like <a href=\"https://thestute.com/2025/11/07/library-reduces-hours-and-services-following-university-budget-cuts/\">Stevens Institute of Technology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/09/princeton-news-adpol-princeton-university-library-branches-cuts-hours-amid-budget-cuts\">Princeton University</a>, have stopped keeping labs and libraries open 24/7 as a way to encourage students to take a break and rest – though admittedly most institutions that have made these changes have done so as a result of budget cuts, and less so as a proactive, preventive measure. </p>\n\n<h2>Positioning students for success</h2>\n\n<p>I have long argued that <a href=\"https://www.naspa.org/book/well-being-leadership-in-higher-education-a-guide-for-successful-well-being-programs\">well-being is central to academic, personal and professional success</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In recent years, I have also encouraged schools to position well-being as the key driver to student academic, personal and professional success. </p>\n\n<p>Research has linked students’ well-being to them staying in school, and findings suggest that colleges can develop <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2024.12\">targeted mental health programs to improve retention rates</a>. In other words, focusing on the health and well-being of students may, in fact, lead to better outcomes – emotionally, physically and academically.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267606/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Travia received funding from the American College Health Foundation for serving as lead author and researcher for a series of papers on framing and measuring well-being from 2019-2022. </span></em></p>",

Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation, spoke with Kate Price, <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/kate-price-ph-d\">an associate research scientist at the Wellesley Centers for Women</a> at Wellesley College, where she studies child sexual exploitation and child sex trafficking policy.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is child sex trafficking and how does it differ from other kinds of trafficking?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is a child being traded for sex via force, fraud or coercion. These are children who are under the age of 18. Often what happens, in terms of victim blaming, if a child is, say, 15, 16, 17, there’s this level of blame from perpetrators, the media, relatives, law enforcement, jurors: “She knew what she was doing.” I recently heard this with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T5Hp2WldFk&amp;t=1903s\">the Epstein files back in the news</a>: “He wasn’t into like 8-year-olds. … There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a 5-year-old.” That’s not true. Children cannot make decisions that adults can. Neuroscience shows that <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-7-things-to-know\">children’s brains are not developed</a> until their mid 20s. Children do not have the same decision-making capacity. That very vulnerability is what is preyed upon by perpetrators. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we not use terms like “child prostitution” anymore, and why does language matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the late 1990s and early aughts, at the beginning of <a href=\"https://ovc.ojp.gov/news/archives/announcements/twenty-years-progress-anti-trafficking-movement\">the anti-human trafficking movement</a>, people did use the term child prostitution. In fact, I used it in a white paper that I did, and I’m a survivor. But once we really adopted and embraced the terminology of force, fraud and coercion of human trafficking, that gave us a new frame to think of the power dynamics that are involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. This phrasing captures the true essence of what is happening within child sex trafficking. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a child somehow deciding that they’re going to go out and trade sex for money, heat, food, anything of value. This is a case of perpetrators, whether they are family members or nonfamily traffickers, who are preying on the vulnerability of children who have often been sexually abused prior to their commercial sexual exploitation. This prior abuse adds another layer of vulnerability.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A billboard advertises for help for survivors of sex trafficking.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703214/original/file-20251118-64-8q2pwl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A billboard in Vadnais Heights, Minn., in 2023 calls for help for survivors of sex trafficking.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/vadnais-heights-minnesota-billboard-advertising-help-for-news-photo/1473556348?adppopup=true\">Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><strong>How do Epstein’s actions fit into the paradigm of trafficking – is he a classic case or an unusual one?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Epstein is not unique. This is absolutely a classic case, for four primary reasons. Child sex trafficking perpetrators are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260515600874\">primarily white men, with wealth and power</a>. Epstein was, granted, among the uber rich and really powerful men. But power is relative to whatever context in which a child is being exploited. The most powerful person in a small town may not be a billionaire like Epstein, but they have disposable income and high socioeconomic status for the area, or they may hold a prominent position in government, church or a civic organization.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein case is also not unique in that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260514555369\">victims are often dehumanized</a>, by perpetrators and in the media. They are blamed, even though they are children who are developmentally incapable of making adult choices. There are <a href=\"https://lamag.com/news/ghislaine-in-chains-what-maxwell-may-know-about-jeffrey-epsteins-john-does/\">transcripts of Maxwell calling the girls “trash</a>.” These are seen as disposable children, not worthy of protections. And they have already been dehumanized within our culture prior to exploitation, whether it be through poverty, lack of educational or employment opportunities, or prior sexual violence. That makes them even more vulnerable to perpetrators such as Epstein and Maxwell, who are looking to prey upon those vulnerabilities. </p>\n\n<p>Third, traffickers often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15248380211025241\">insulate themselves from detection</a> and trafficking charges by having others, such as women or girls, recruiting victims for them, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell.html\">which is exactly what Epstein did</a>. Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/resources/reports/a-six-year-analysis-of-sex-traffickers-of-minors/\">traffickers and buyers often plea down their trafficking charges</a>. That results in low trafficking prosecution rates. They plea down from a charge like trafficking of a minor to assault, so this does not count toward trafficking prosecution rates. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/12/934265386/jeffrey-epsteins-former-prosecutors-used-poor-judgment-in-deal-doj-says\">Epstein did exactly this in 2008</a> when he accepted prosecutor Alex Acosta’s nonprosecution agreement to plead guilty to two lesser Florida state-level prostitution charges rather than facing the multiple federal child sex trafficking charges for which Epstein was being investigated. This ability to use their wealth and power hides the truth of what is happening.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What systems allow sex trafficking to happen, and how can we change those systems?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement often looks the other way. In the Epstein case, one of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/us/epstein-women-lawsuit-fbi\">victims had reached out to the FBI</a> decades ago and nothing happened. It’s really been the persistence of the survivors, saying people really need to look at this. </p>\n\n<p>Child sex trafficking is not a political issue. It’s one of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/magazine/the-conservative-crusade-thats-about-so-much-more-than-epstein.html\">the few bipartisan issues in our country</a> that is so culturally divided. Yet Americans need to acknowledge that perpetrators comes from all political affiliations, they come from all races, socioeconomic status. As a culture, we really need to not blame victims and survivors. These are children who are being manipulated and violated. So recognizing the truth of power differences between perpetrators and victims is something that we as a culture very much need to do. By supporting victims, we can use our power – as relatives, jurors, constituents, elected officials – to hold traffickers and buyers to account. Victim-blaming creates a diversion that cements perpetrators’ ability to exploit and abuse children without fear of detection.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a red blazer points to a poster showing a man hugging a woman.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703217/original/file-20251118-66-qndztu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announces charges against Ghislaine Maxwell on July 2, 2020, for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/JeffreyEpsteinAssociate/063a1414200045c2a02aae49a6a28d13/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/John Minchillo, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In terms of legislation, most states in the country still retain the right to <a href=\"https://humantraffickingsearch.org/resource/safe-harbor-does-your-state-arrest-minors-for-prostitution/\">criminalize sexually exploited minors</a>, either through arrests or prosecution. These are laws that all states have considered since 2007, when New York was the first state to <a href=\"https://ww2.nycourts.gov/sites/default/files/document/files/2018-07/MULLEN%20_HUMAN%20TRAFFICKING_1_d_0.pdf\">introduce a Safe Harbor law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Massachusetts, where I live, law enforcement retains the right to <a href=\"https://reportcards.sharedhope.org/year2025/massachussetts/\">arrest or prosecute a minor for prostitution</a>. That often doesn’t happen. But the reason law enforcement says <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15564886.2022.2153956\">it needs to have these laws</a> is because it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253353/\">encourages children to get services</a>. It’s a leverage point. </p>\n\n<p>But oftentimes children do not trust law enforcement. And often for good reason. <a href=\"https://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/26/46\">Some law enforcement are perpretrators</a>. Other times, law enforcement tells sex-trafficked minors, “We’re doing this for your protection, we’re going to lock you up.” Both instances are deeply traumatizing and lead to mistrust of the police. That being said, so many extraordinary law enforcement agents are committed to supporting child sex trafficking victims and holding perpetrators to account. </p>\n\n<p>Much of this retraumatization happens because local and state governments do not have the money for social services, trauma-informed, child sex trafficking-specific services, and housing opportunities for children to be able to heal. What we have is a robust criminal legal system. So, until we have a robust system that can support children who have been trafficked, sex trafficking is going to continue, in my experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any last thoughts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need to acknowledge low prosecution rates of child sexual abuse cases, that 14% of all reported – just reported – <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/images/pdf/2022-williams-block-pcsa-white-paper.pdf\">child sexual abuse perpetrators are convicted</a> or plead guilty. Similarly, in terms of adult rape charges, <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Archived-Projects/sexual-violence-case-attrition\">1% of cases end in a conviction</a> or guilty plea. So much of this lack of perpetrator accountability comes through this employment of plea deals and dehumanizing and retraumatizing victims during legal proceedings. </p>\n\n<p>So we need to acknowledge when our criminal-legal system is not doing justice to victims whatsoever, and they’re allowing perpetrators to walk free. In the Epstein case, we’re focused on a few people, while hundreds of perpetrators continue to walk free. By employing these tactics, predators will continue to use the societal silence and misperceptions to their advantage. If it takes a village to raise a child, it also takes a village to sexually exploit a child.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270127/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kate Price does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Hundreds of thousands more were imprisoned, sent to labor camps or subjected to political persecution. To these figures, we must add the roughly half a million people who <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9788479190811/memoria-historica-Guerra-civil-espa%C3%B1ola-8479190817/plp\">fled or were forced into exile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Among the multitudes of Francoism’s victims were women and children who endured psychological and physical abuse in prisons, orphanages and asylums. Yet for decades their experiences have remained marginal in the public narrative – highlighting the uneven acknowledgment of different groups of victims amid Spain’s broader struggle to confront its past.</p>\n\n<p>Still, their stories remain alive in the testimonies of the women who were imprisoned by the regime. In the summer of 2024, I conducted research at <a href=\"https://politicasdelamemoria.org/en/2011/01/documentation-center-of-historical-memory-5/\">the Documentation Center of Historical Memory in Salamanca</a>, collecting documented written accounts of traumatic experiences suffered by Spain’s female population under Franco. They reveal the extent to which Francoist repression was structured through gender, framing women as inherently subordinate and subjecting those who resisted the regime’s patriarchal order to especially severe punishment.</p>\n\n<h2>Franco’s gendered violence</h2>\n\n<p>My study explores the testimonies of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2020.1740775\">women imprisoned during the civil war or subsequent decades</a>, all of whom endured suffering related to their motherhood. While some were detained for their ideological allegiance to the republic that preceded Franco’s ascent, others had no formal partisan affiliations or were merely related to men who did.  </p>\n\n<p>These women suffered what many survivors and historians <a href=\"https://buscador.womenslegacyproject.eu/catalog/40892011_en?locale=en\">have described as a “double punishment</a>” – targeted not only for their beliefs or associations but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc1TpHOEiEg\">just for being women and mothers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest testimony I came across was from a woman detained in 1939, just three years after Franco, a military general, <a href=\"https://tienda.elviejotopo.com/fascismo/1113-el-silencio-roto-mujeres-contra-el-franquismo-9788495776402.html\">led an uprising</a> against the democratically elected government of the Second Republic that precipitated the civil war and his subsequent reign.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A military men salutes toward a crowd.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703386/original/file-20251119-66-9ev7z2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=567&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Franco gives a fascist salute as he and his Nationalist forces enter Barcelona in March 1939.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GENFRANCO/c4d09cf1dde6da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Under Franco’s dictatorial regime, women’s roles were rigidly controlled by the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constructing_Spanish_Womanhood/lX3mYCs6qq8C?hl=en\">ideology of National Catholicism</a>, which linked femininity, motherhood and loyalty to the state. The church reinforced this vision, “dictating that women served the fatherland through self-sacrifice and dedication to the common good.”</p>\n\n<p>Those who defied the patriarchy were criminalized and subjected to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02656914231214932\">re-education</a>” focused on religious values. </p>\n\n<p>Women’s so-called “redemption” under this reeducation was <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9788484602309/Irredentas-Spanish-Edition-Vinyes-Ricard-8484602303/plp\">no less violent than their confinement</a>. As one witness described, in May of 1939 the auditorium of Las Ventas prison was prepared to celebrate “two girls and a boy (… recently) born in prison.” During the ceremony, a choir “composed of forty inmates, including opera singers, music teachers, violinists, and amateurs,” had to perform the national anthems with the fascist arm-raised salute. </p>\n\n<p>Yet confinement itself was particularly brutal.</p>\n\n<p>According to Josefina García, a woman imprisoned during the 1940s, guards regularly insulted and beat inmates. “If you were at home behaving like decent women, you wouldn’t be here,” she recalled one saying. García continued: “Of course, they used a crude, sexist language. The police ‘used words’ in a way that sometimes leave a mark deeper than a bruise.” </p>\n\n<p>Gender also played a role in the type of punishment prisoners received. Following their arrest, women were subjected to <a href=\"https://www.vscw.ca/en/node/41\">head shaving, forced ingestion of castor oil</a> and the subsequent public humiliation of being made to walk in circles while defecating. In addition, they were often subjected to sexual violence by prison guards or interrogating officers.</p>\n\n<p>Recounting her experience, another witness reported the case of an 18-year-old sister of a guerrilla fighter in Valencia who “was subjected to terrible torture, stripped naked in a room with several Civil Guards who pricked her breasts, genitals, and stomach with … needles.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Someone holds a sign for a missing person at a protest.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703389/original/file-20251119-66-t5p13u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A protester holds a banner with an image of an unknown woman – a victim of the Franco regime.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=franco%20victims%20spain&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Paul White</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Motherhood as battleground</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most painful aspects of Franco’s repression was the forced separation of mothers and their children. </p>\n\n<p>Upon incarceration, women frequently lost custody of their sons and daughters, who were placed in orphanages or adopted by families loyal to Franco and his regime. Such violent ruptures of the maternal bond were more than an act of personal cruelty – they were a calculated political strategy rooted in the broader Francoist ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Since Francoism promoted an <a href=\"https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/1805d771-b951-4a0e-9b03-39c4622edbe4/content\">image of women as obedient wives and self-sacrificing mothers</a> devoted to the Catholic family model, Republican women were demonized as immoral, dangerous and unworthy of motherhood.</p>\n\n<p>By stripping women of their children, the regime both punished them and reinforced its narrative that only “loyal” women could be true mothers.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, child-rearing or birth during incarceration was marked by fear and uncertainty. In certain cases, newborns were allowed to stay with their mothers for a short time. However, a lack of proper nourishment and mental exhaustion made breastfeeding an impossible task. </p>\n\n<p>At times, women who began to lactate were denied the possibility of nursing their infants, leading to physical pain and emotional torment.</p>\n\n<p>More often, babies were permanently taken away altogether, deemed at risk of being “contaminated” by their mothers’ ideological values. </p>\n\n<p>“When I was arrested, my son was five days old,” one victim, Carmen Caamaño, reported. “About a year later, they said I no longer needed to breastfeed him and took the child out of the prison. Some friends had to take him in because I had no family there.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Women present flowers at a memorial.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=409&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703388/original/file-20251119-56-g508hn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=514&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Women pay tribute to victims of the Franco regime in front of a flag of the Spanish Republic.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=women%20franco%20spain&amp;mediaType=photo\">P Photo/Alvaro Barrientos</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There were also countless cases in which children were imprisoned alongside their mothers. With no other relatives to care for them, these children suffered from hunger, disease and a lack of basic hygiene in their overcrowded cells. For mothers, the psychological burden was immense as they were forced to watch their children suffer, yet they had no power to protect them. </p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 1941, about six or seven children died daily in these prisons from starvation and diseases, according to accounts of survivors.</p>\n\n<h2>Trauma and resistance</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside trauma, there were also moments of resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Mothers in prison looked for ways to nurture their children despite scarcity and fear. Testimonies I reviewed relate cases of inmates sharing food, telling stories and protecting children as best they could.

Survivors often speak of the pain of separation as an open wound that lasted a lifetime. Children raised in prisons or separated from their families carried the scars into adulthood. </p>\n\n<p>Even decades after the regime ended, many descendants still struggle with the weight of this silenced past. Yet because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/opinion/spain-sanchez-amnesty-law.html\">Spain’s Amnesty Act of 1977</a>, which was granted for past political crimes, those responsible for atrocities committed under Franco have seldom been held accountable. </p>\n\n<p>Histories of the Franco years often leave the grief of the intergenerational trauma in the shadows. And for the victims themselves, the traumatic motherhood experiences under his dictatorship reveal more than just personal suffering – they expose how authoritarian power can reach into the most intimate parts of life.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249931/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Zaya Rustamova received funding to conduct this study from Radow J.

But the world’s climate finance so far has rested on a shaky foundation of fuzzy accounting, one where funding for airports, hotels and even ice cream stores is being counted as climate finance.</p>\n\n<h2>Cooking the climate finance books</h2>\n\n<p>Wealthy nations first promised in 2009 to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/\">raise $100 billion a year</a> in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Whether they <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html\">hit that target in 2022</a>, as claimed, is up for debate.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have found many cases where the reported numbers were inflated, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/has-100-billion-climate-goal-been-reached\">largely due to relabeling of general aid</a> that was already being provided and calling it “climate aid.”</p>\n\n<p>The United Kingdom, for example, claims it is on track to meet its £11.6 billion (about $15.2 billion) pledge, but it is doing so in part by <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-climate-aid-to-hit-11-6bn-goal-but-only-due-to-accounting-rule-change/\">reclassifying existing humanitarian and development aid</a> as “climate finance.”</p>\n\n<p>This practice undermines the <a href=\"https://careclimatechange.org/seeing-double-decoding-the-additionality-of-climate-finance/\">principle of additionality</a> – the idea that climate finance should represent “new and additional” resources beyond traditional aid, and not simply be a new label on funds already planned for other purposes.</p>\n\n<p>An analysis by the climate news site Carbon Brief suggests that to truly meet its target, the U.K. would need to provide <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-climate-aid-to-hit-11-6bn-goal-but-only-due-to-accounting-rule-change/\">78% more than it currently does</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.K.’s “creative accounting” is not a one-off.</p>\n\n<p>The Center for Global Development estimates that <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/100-billion-climate-finance-provided-fact-or-fiction\">at least one-third</a> of the new public climate funds in 2022 actually came from existing aid budgets. In some cases, the money had been shifted to climate adaptation projects, but often development projects were relabeled as “climate finance.” </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"zDnr7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zDnr7/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>What’s counted as climate finance comes from a mix of sources and is predominantly provided through loans and grants. Some funding is bilateral, flowing directly from one country to another. Some is multilateral and distributed through organizations such as the World Bank or the <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/about\">Green Climate Fund</a> that are funded by the world’s governments. Money from private investors and corporations can also count in this growing but fragmented system.</p>\n\n<p>Countries providing the assistance have been able to stretch the definition of climate finance so they can count almost any project, including some that have little to do with reducing emissions or helping communities adapt. </p>\n\n<h2>Fossil fuels, hotels and ice cream stores</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to climate finance, the devil is in the project details.</p>\n\n<p>Take Japan, for example. In 2020, its state-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation used an environmental fund to finance a 1,200-megawatt coal plant in central Vietnam. That power plant <a href=\"https://www.marketforces.org.au/research/vietnam/vung-ang-2/\">will emit far more air pollution</a> than <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/comparison-of-coal-power-plant-emissions-standards/\">Japan would allow</a> for a power plant within its own borders.</p>\n\n<p>The same bank <a href=\"https://www.jica.go.jp/Resource/egypt/english/office/others/c8h0vm0000b394wa-att/publication_15.pdf\">labeled an airport expansion in Egypt</a> as “eco-friendly” because it included solar panels and LED lights. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An external view of a new concourse\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702649/original/file-20251116-56-llntwz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Japan counted funding for Egypt’s Alexandria International Airport, formerly Borg El Arab International Airport, as climate finance.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexandria_International_Airport_%28Egypt%29_Terminal_2.jpg\">Abdelrhman 1990</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In some cases, these projects increase greenhouse gas emissions, rather than lowering them. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, Japan funded an <a href=\"https://www.jica.go.jp/english/overseas/png/activities/activity20.html\">airport expansion in Papua New Guinea</a> that it labeled as climate finance because it was expected to reduce fuel use. However, an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, used in Reuters’ analysis, found that if the airport meets passenger targets in its first three years, emissions from outbound flights will rise by an <a href=\"https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/\">estimated 90% over 2013 levels</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Italy claimed $4.7 million as climate finance for <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/un-climate-finance-1.6861666\">helping a chocolate and ice cream company expand into Asia</a> by saying that the project had a “climate component.” And the U.S. counted a $19.5 million <a href=\"https://www.actionaidusa.org/climate-finance-quantity-matters-but-so-does-quality/\">Marriott Hotel development in Haiti</a> as “climate finance” because the hotel project included stormwater control and hurricane protection measures.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Xql1P\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xql1P/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These are not isolated examples. Reuters reviewed climate finance documents it received from 27 countries and found that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/special-report-nations-who-pledged-to-fight-climate-change-are-sending-money-to-idUSL6N37N076/\">at least $3 billion labeled as climate finance</a> went to projects that had little or nothing to do with fighting or recovering from climate change. That included <a href=\"https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/\">movie financing, coal plant construction and crime prevention programs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For many of these projects, the money comes in the form of loans, which means the developed country that provided the loan will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/\">make money off the interest</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why fixing climate finance matters</h2>\n\n<p>A central test for the success of international climate talks will be whether governments can finally agree on a shared definition of “climate finance,” one that protects the interests of vulnerable countries and avoids creating long-term debt.</p>\n\n<p>Without that clear definition, donor countries can continue to count marginal or loosely related investments as climate finance.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s43093-025-00596-6\">plenty of examples</a> that show how targeted climate finance can help vulnerable countries cut emissions, adapt to rising risks and recover from climate-driven disasters. It has helped saved lives in Bangladesh with <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/06/29/climate-finance-protects-the-vulnerable\">early warning systems and storm shelters</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2023.100495\">improved crop resistance to worsening drought</a> in Kenya, among other projects.</p>\n\n<p>But when governments and banks count existing development projects and fossil fuel upgrades as “climate investments,” the result is an illusion of progress while developing countries face worsening climate risks. At the same time, wealthy countries are still spending <a href=\"https://data.one.org/analysis/climate-finance-hypocrisy\">hundreds of billions of dollars on fossil fuel subsidies</a>, which further drive climate change.</p>\n\n<p>For countries from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/g-s1-95941/haiti-jamaica-cuba-hurricane-melissa-recovery\">Jamaica</a> to <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/bangladesh/blog/vulnerability-action-why-bangladeshs-climate-vulnerability-index-cvi-game-changer\">Bangladesh</a> to <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp007\">the Maldives</a>, the threats from climate change are existential. Every misreported or “creatively counted” climate finance dollar means slower recovery, lost livelihoods and longer waits for clean water and electricity after the next storm.</p>\n\n<p><em>University of Southern California environmental science students Nickole Aguilar Cortes and Brandon Kim contributed to this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268764/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Gibson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Water is a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/eight-ingredients-life-in-space.html\">key ingredient for life</a>, and on a planet too close to its star, water on its surface may “boil”; too far, and it could freeze. This zone marks the region in between. </p>\n\n<p>But being in this <a href=\"https://www.space.com/goldilocks-zone-habitable-area-life\">sweet spot</a> doesn’t automatically mean a planet is hospitable to life. Other factors, like whether a planet is geologically active or has processes that regulate gases in its atmosphere, play a role. </p>\n\n<p>The habitable zone provides a useful guide to search for signs of life on exoplanets – planets outside our solar system orbiting other stars. But what’s in these planets’ atmospheres holds the next clue about whether liquid water — and possibly life — exists beyond Earth.  </p>\n\n<p>On Earth, the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/\">greenhouse effect</a>, caused by gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor, keeps the planet warm enough for liquid water and life as we know it. Without an atmosphere, Earth’s surface temperature would <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/\">average around zero degrees Fahrenheit</a> (minus 18 degrees Celsius), far below the freezing point of water. </p>\n\n<p>The boundaries of the habitable zone are defined by how much of a “greenhouse effect” is necessary to maintain the surface temperatures that allow for liquid water to persist. It’s a balance between sunlight and atmospheric warming.</p>\n\n<p>Many planetary scientists, <a href=\"https://profiles.rice.edu/student/morgan-underwood\">including me</a>, are seeking to understand if the processes responsible for regulating Earth’s climate are operating on other habitable zone worlds.

It provides a starting point, directing astronomers to where they might expect to find planets with liquid water, without needing to know every detail about the planet’s atmosphere or history. </p>\n\n<p>Its definition is partially informed by what scientists know about Earth’s rocky neighbors. Mars, which lies just outside the outer edge of the habitable zone, shows <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/nasa-rover-finds-fresh-evidence-warm-wet-past-mars-2025-04-17/\">clear evidence of ancient rivers and lakes</a> where liquid water once flowed. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Venus is currently too close to the Sun to be within the habitable zone. Yet, some <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/science/what-happened-to-all-the-water-on-venus/\">geochemical evidence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/giss/nasa-climate-modeling-suggests-venus-may-have-been-habitable/\">modeling studies</a> suggest Venus may have had water in its past, though how much and for how long remains uncertain. </p>\n\n<p>These examples show that while the habitable zone is not a perfect predictor of habitability, it provides a useful starting point. </p>\n\n<h2>Planetary processes can inform habitability</h2>\n\n<p>What the habitable zone doesn’t do is determine whether a planet can sustain habitable conditions over long periods of time. On Earth, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2006.1895\">stable climate allowed life to emerge and persist</a>. Liquid water could remain on the surface, <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/origin-life-earth-explained\">giving slow chemical reactions enough time</a> to build the molecules of life and <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/early-life-had-evolutionary-power-to-survive-radical-changes-in-environment/\">let early ecosystems develop resilience</a> to change, which reinforced habitability. </p>\n\n<p>Life emerged on Earth, but <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/astrobiology/an-ancient-partnership-co-evolution-of-earth-environments-and-microbial-lifean-ancient-partnership/\">continued to reshape the environments it evolved in</a>, making them more conducive to life. </p>\n\n<p>This stability likely unfolded over hundreds of millions of years, as the planet’s surface, oceans and atmosphere worked together as part of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/biosphere-2s-latest-mission-learning-how-life-first-emerged-on-earth-and-how-to-make-barren-worlds-habitable-262293\">a slow but powerful system</a> to regulate Earth’s temperature. </p>\n\n<p>A key part of this system is how <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle\">Earth recycles inorganic carbon</a> between the atmosphere, surface and oceans over the course of millions of years. Inorganic carbon refers to carbon bound in atmospheric gases, dissolved in seawater or locked in minerals, rather than biological material. This part of the carbon cycle <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2022/earth-stabilizing-temperature-1116\">acts like a natural thermostat</a>. When volcanoes release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide molecules trap heat and warm the planet. As temperatures rise, rain and weathering draw carbon out of the air and store it in rocks and oceans. </p>\n\n<p>If the planet cools, this process slows down, allowing carbon dioxide, a warming <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas\">greenhouse gas</a>, to build up in the atmosphere again. This part of the carbon cycle has helped Earth recover from past ice ages and avoid runaway warming. </p>\n\n<p>Even as the Sun has gradually brightened, this cycle has contributed to keeping temperatures on Earth within a range where liquid water and life can persist for long spans of time. </p>\n\n<p>Now, scientists are asking whether similar geological processes might operate on other planets, and if so, how they might detect them. For example, if researchers could observe enough rocky planets in their stars’ habitable zones, they could <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19896-2\">look for a pattern</a> connecting the amount of sunlight a planet receives and how much carbon dioxide is in its atmosphere. Finding such a pattern may hint that the same kind of carbon-cycling process could be operating elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>The mix of gases in a planet’s atmosphere is shaped by what’s happening on or below its surface. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ada384\">One study</a> shows that measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide in a number of rocky planets could reveal whether their surfaces are broken into a number of moving plates, like Earth’s, or if their crusts are more rigid. On Earth, these <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tectonics.html\">shifting plates</a> drive volcanism and rock weathering, which are key to carbon cycling.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A diagram showing a few small planets orbiting a star.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698466/original/file-20251024-56-t4e870.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Simulation of what space telescopes, like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will capture when looking at distant solar systems.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/\">STScI, NASA GSFC</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Keeping an eye on distant atmospheres</h2>\n\n<p>The next step will be <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aa738a\">toward gaining a population-level perspective</a> of planets in their stars’ habitable zones.

Doing so would allow them to test whether the zone accurately predicts where habitable conditions are possible, or whether some planets maintain conditions suitable for liquid water beyond the zone’s edges. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of approach is especially important given <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cosmic-milestone-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets/\">the diversity of exoplanets</a>.

Three weeks later, the <a href=\"https://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/\">General Framework Agreement</a>, known as the Dayton Peace Accords, was signed.</p>\n\n<p>The war over Bosnia was the most brutal and devastating of the wars spawned by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Yugoslavia\">dissolution of Yugoslavia</a>. Attacked from the moment it moved toward independence in early 1992 by militias supported by the neighboring nations of Croatia and Serbia, Bosnia was born under fire and nearly perished. Half of its population of 4.4 million were forcefully displaced, and over <a href=\"https://everycasualty.org/conflict/bosnia-herzegovina/\">100,000 people died</a> during the conflict. </p>\n\n<p>Ethnic cleansing and war crimes marked the war, including <a href=\"https://www.icty.org/en/outreach/documentaries/srebrenica-genocide-no-room-for-denial\">the Srebrenica genocide</a> of July 1995, in which <a href=\"https://srebrenicamemorial.org/en\">more than 8,000 Bosniak victims</a> were murdered by the army of Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/getting-to-dayton/\">The peace agreed to at Dayton</a> left Bosnia, or Bosnia and Herzegovina as it is known in full, intact as a country but divided into two entities, Republika Srpska – a secessionist entity proclaimed by ethnonationalist Serbs in January 1992 – and the Bosnian Federation. Meanwhile, an international military force was deployed to secure the peace.</p>\n\n<p>But it was an ugly peace: The patient was saved, but left deformed and weak. As scholars who have written extensively about <a href=\"http://doi.org//10.1007/978-3-319-48293-4\">the Bosnian war</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bosnia-Remade-Ethnic-Cleansing-Reversal/dp/0199730369\">its aftermath</a>, we believe the legacy of the Dayton Peace Accords, 30 years on, is decidedly mixed.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"2VPJs\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2VPJs/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The sorting of ethno-territories</h2>\n\n<p>Bosnia’s life after Dayton can be divided into three roughly decade-long eras: reconstruction, stalemate and permanent crisis. </p>\n\n<p>The first decade was the toughest but most hopeful. With peace enforced by an international force including U.S. and Russian troops, Bosnians returned to their war-shattered country.</p>\n\n<p>But restoring the country’s social fabric proved hard. While the international community aspired to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Cleansing-through-Minority-Returns/dp/0198941358\">reverse ethnic cleansing</a>, the obstacles were immense.</p>\n\n<p>A once <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bosnia-Hercegovina-Tradition-Robert-Donia/dp/0231101619\">proudly multicultural country</a> was left divided into separate ethno-territories.</p>\n\n<p>Under <a href=\"https://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/annex-7-2/\">the Dayton Accords</a>, Bosnians were promised the right to return home.

What became evident, however, is that “minority returns” – that is, people returning to places where they would be a minority community – were limited. Many returnees reacquired their old property after a struggle but promptly sold it to build a life elsewhere among people who were the same ethnicity as them. </p>\n\n<p>Cross-ethnic trust was largely <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/books/srebrenica-in-the-aftermath-of-genocide/9D3BD3456AB6963AA1D5F2C888AB0865\">shattered by wartime experiences</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Incompatible horizons</h2>\n\n<p>The first decade was peak <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/swordsploughshar0000ashd\">liberal international statebuilding</a>.

A central state border service and investigations agency was created. So also was a central state court, state-level criminal codes and an indirect taxation authority to unify indirect tax collection and finance <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Improvised-State-Sovereignty-Performance-Agency/dp/1444337009/\">state institutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bosnia’s trajectory, though, stalled in 2006 when the high representative <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intervention-Work-Norton-Global-Ethics/dp/0393081206/\">stepped back from state building</a>. In April 2006, a package of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2747/1538-7216.47.1.61\">constitutional amendments</a> designed to streamline Dayton by strengthening central state institutions fell two votes short in the state Parliament. </p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, the package was not blocked by parties from Republika Srpska, traditional obstructionists, but by former Prime Minister <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Silajd%C5%BEi%C4%87\">Haris Silajdžić’s</a> Bosniak-dominated party. This failure set the stage for a decade of polarization and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13537110903372367\">stalemate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Silajdžić campaigned for abolition of the entities – Republika Srpska and the Bosnian Federation – and the creation of a single united Bosnia. Republika Srpska’s leading politician, Milorad Dodik, answered by floating the prohibited <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/abs/republika-srpska-will-have-a-referendum-the-rhetorical-politics-of-milorad-dodik/E8C4E2E90DF78AEC110E754D8F83A015\">idea of an entity independence referendum</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the high representative <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/diplomatic-counterinsurgency/03903B777718EC4D869F44CEC119DC2D\">largely passive</a>, Bosnia was stalemated between incompatible horizons, each side strong enough to block but too weak to prevail. </p>\n\n<p>Dodik turned <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/abs/comments-on-gerard-toals-republika-srpska-will-have-a-referendum-the-rhetorical-politics-of-milorad-dodik/DB4F6737DE906348BDA1B40098F9EC98\">referendum talk</a> in Republika Srpska into a steady repertoire of threat, while casting central state institutions in Sarajevo as rotten, artificial and destined to fail. In the process, Dodik and his family got rich, creating a classic <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2793\">patronal power network</a> across Republika Srpska.</p>\n\n<p>With the media thoroughly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315594477\">divided by wartime allegiances</a>, the public sphere was filled with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17449057.2022.2072560\">incendiary rhetoric</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The word “inat” is a shared idiom across Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. It is stubborn uprightness, a combination of narcissism and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-trumps-foreign-policy-might-be-driven-by-simple-spite-heres-what-to-do-about-it-252099\">spite</a>. Politics increasingly rewarded those who could perform “inat” more vividly than their rivals.</p>\n\n<p>Central state institutions in Bosnia did not collapse <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/building-democracy-in-the-yugoslav-successor-states/durable-oligarchy-bosnia-and-herzegovinas-false-postwar-democratic-transition/7C7F0982734391DB0D6BD86B5AFF771C\">but became sclerotic</a>. Procedures multiplied, confidence thinned and decision-making settled into a theater of anticipatory vetoes where the point was less to implement a program than to keep imagined endpoints – the creation of a unified nation on one side; an independent Republika Srpska on the other – alive and to make the other side feel the pain of their impossibility.</p>\n\n<h2>A country on the brink</h2>\n\n<p>A decade of stalemate slowly evolved into a condition of permanent crisis. </p>\n\n<p>In November 2015, Bosnia’s Constitutional Court ruled that the marking of Jan. 9 as “Republika Srpska Day” – a celebration of virtual independence – was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/9/why-is-republika-srpska-day-controversial-in-bosnia\">discriminatory and illegal</a> under human rights law.</p>\n\n<p>Dodik, the Republika Srpska’s de facto leader, responded by organizing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37465653\">an extralegal referendum</a> whose result asserted that the Republika Srpska population wanted the date retained. </p>\n\n<p>Defiance evolved into active subversion of the constitutional order and provisions of Dayton. The Republika Srpska parliament passed laws that directly challenged central state institutions built in the first postwar decade. With weak enforcement capacity, the Bosnian state was unable to command compliance. </p>\n\n<p>When in 2021 a new high representative was appointed over Russian objections, Dodik rejected his authority outright. By then, Bosnia was routinely described as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/magazine/bosnia-genocide-pyramids.html\">on the brink</a>” of war.</p>\n\n<p>Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw <a href=\"https://www.ponarseurasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pepm846_Toal-Muzaferija_June2023.pdf\">Dodik side firmly with Moscow</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/bosnian-serb-leader-dodik-sucks-up-to-putin-and-praises-orban/\">visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow</a> frequently. The Republika Srpska media relayed Russian propaganda, featuring correspondents reporting live from Russia’s front lines.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two men talk while seated at a table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703242/original/file-20251118-66-h9cuqh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with the president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, on Feb. 21, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/in-this-pool-photograph-distributed-by-russian-state-agency-news-photo/2019986258?adppopup=true\">Sergei Bobylyov/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, people and institutions in the Bosnian Federation aligned with Ukraine and the West.

But “rabbi” means much more than that. For example, a rabbi could be a teacher, a nonprofit executive for a Jewish organization or a scholar of Jewish law – and, increasingly, some of those roles are held by Orthodox women.  </p>\n\n<p>For decades, liberal denominations have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-ordination-of-the-first-female-rabbi-50-years-ago-has-brought-many-changes-and-some-challenges-181391\">permitted women to be ordained</a>. Orthodox Judaism, however, has largely prohibited it. Yet attitudes toward women’s study of rabbinic texts is changing, leading some Orthodox leaders to conclude that women are <a href=\"https://www.associationforjewishstudies.org/publications-research/ajs-perspectives/the-body-issue/orthodox-female-clergy-embodying-religious-authority\">qualified for rabbinic jobs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Israel’s chief rabbis – known as the Rabbinate, and historically seen as the top authority for the country’s Orthodox institutions – do not recognize women as rabbis or permit their ordination. But a significant change came in July 2025, when Israel’s High Court of Justice determined that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-861147#google_vignette\">women must be allowed to take the Rabbinate’s exams</a> about Jewish law. The chief rabbis appealed the decision, but the court <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-873527\">rejected their request for a retrial</a> in November.</p>\n\n<p>These tests are required to apply for public sector jobs as any kind of Jewish religious authority in Israel: ensuring that restaurants adhere to Jewish dietary laws, for example. Passing does not make someone an ordained rabbi; ordination is conferred through private rabbis and schools, and most Orthodox communities do not recognize female rabbis. But it does allow women to apply for jobs previously available only to men and receive higher salaries for the educational jobs they have already. Most importantly, the High Court’s decision recognizes that women have achieved high levels of education in rabbinic law.</p>\n\n<p>I am <a href=\"https://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/people/core-faculty/michal-raucher\">a scholar of Jewish women and gender</a> who researches religious authority among Orthodox women. While there have always been highly educated women, the court’s ruling reflects a growing trend among Orthodox women, while also opening up professional opportunities. </p>\n\n<h2>From Torah to Talmud</h2>\n\n<p>Formed in the 19th century, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/jewish-denominations-a-brief-guide-for-the-perplexed-207297\">Orthodox Judaism</a> is oriented around a strict observance of Jewish law and commitment to traditional gender roles. The denomination contains many divisions, each one adjusting their observance of Jewish law differently in response to modernity. While boys and men have been traditionally educated in Torah and rabbinic texts, historically girls and women did not have access to any formal Jewish education. </p>\n\n<p>In the early 20th century, Jewish Polish teacher Sarah Schenirer <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sarah-schenirer-and-the-bais-yaakov-movement/6305A7D1D56973D1B48B99EB601A4A97\">revolutionized Orthodox girls’ education</a> by founding the Bais Yaakov school system, now found in many countries. The <a href=\"https://thebaisyaakovproject.religion.utoronto.ca/timeline-sarah-schenirer-and-interwar-bais-yaakov/\">Bais Yaakov education</a> focused on teaching women Torah, while maintaining women’s place within the Jewish home.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo shows several rows of girls formally posed for a large class picture outside.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=382&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702686/original/file-20251116-66-2z9pm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=480&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Bais Yaakov Orthodox school for girls in what is now Bielsko-Biala, Poland, around 1938.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beth_Jaakow_Bielsko_Biala_01.jpg\">Collection of the Archive of the Jewish Community in Bielsko-Biala, Poland/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But soon another debate arose: whether women could study Talmud. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Talmud\">This text</a>, composed between the second and seventh centuries C.E., contains the building blocks of rabbinic law. Studying the Talmud means learning the language, references and argument style of the Jewish legal system, called “halakha.”</p>\n\n<p>Supporters and opponents of Talmud study for women both argued that <a href=\"https://wsupress.wayne.edu/9780814344804/\">it would forever alter orthodoxy</a>. Opponents feared that if women understood Talmudic discussions, they would be interested in participating more in public religious life, upsetting the gender norms at the heart of orthodoxy. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, in the 1970s, some well-known rabbis in Israel and America <a href=\"https://thelehrhaus.com/commentary/nafshah-hashkah-ba-torah-a-response-to-rabbi-saul-berman/?rq=talmud\">invited women into Talmud study</a>. Since then, the number of Orthodox institutions that offer advanced Talmud study for women has grown significantly. Fifty years ago, there were only two options: <a href=\"https://www.yu.edu/stern\">Stern College of Yeshiva University</a> in New York, or Michlelet Bruriah in Israel, now called <a href=\"https://www.midreshet-lindenbaum.org.il/\">Midreshet Lindenbaum</a>. Today, dozens of institutions offer programs for Orthodox women who want to study rabbinic law. </p>\n\n<p>The institutions where women can learn Talmud and rabbinic law span the Orthodox landscape. Many are affiliated with open or modern orthodoxy, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/jewish-denominations-a-brief-guide-for-the-perplexed-207297\">have embraced changes</a> related to gender roles. Some cater to the <a href=\"https://www.harediresearchgroup.org/report/\">Haredi or “ultra-Orthodox” population</a>, and others to communities in between.</p>\n\n<p>Most students who complete these programs are not seeking traditional ordination as rabbis. But the women graduate prepared for several other types of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/orthodox-jewish-womens-leadership-is-growing-and-its-not-all-about-rabbis-169498\">religious leadership</a>, such as Jewish education, or as halakha guides for other women. Some programs prepare students to answer Jewish legal questions in particular areas, such as practices during menstruation or childbirth.</p>\n\n<h2>Feminist network</h2>\n\n<p>This growth in opportunities for Orthodox women is the result of a network of Orthodox feminists working across borders since the 1970s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a purple dress and headwrap gestures as she speaks on stage, facing a large, darkened auditorium full of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702687/original/file-20251116-56-xnrkti.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Orthodox women attend an event to celebrate the completion of a 7½-year cycle of daily Talmud study in Jerusalem on Jan. 5, 2020.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IsraelOrthodoxWomen/762c2c58a17542098ff36f0335ae0d29/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Michlelet Bruriah, for example, was founded by two American Jews who immigrated to Israel in the 1960s.

He filed the lawsuit along with his wife, Michelle Cohen Farber, another American immigrant to Israel. She uses the title “rabbanit,” which traditionally refers to someone married to a rabbi. In her case, it also refers to her own expertise in Jewish legal texts: She <a href=\"https://hadran.org.il/\">co-founded Hadran</a>, an organization that promotes Talmud study among women. </p>\n\n<p>Other petitioners include Rabbanit Avital Engelberg, an Israeli-born graduate of <a href=\"https://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/\">Yeshivat Maharat</a> who directs the seminary’s Israeli branch.</p>\n\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n\n<p>Women’s training allows them to enter a variety of fields. Opportunities for Orthodox women’s religious leadership is growing, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/orthodox-jewish-womens-leadership-is-growing-and-its-not-all-about-rabbis-169498\">and it’s not all about ordination</a>. “Yoatzot halacha,” for example, counsel other women about issues related to marriage, sex and reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, these programs – and the Israeli court’s decision – validate women’s religious leadership. For decades, many Orthodox Jews have looked to Israel’s Orthodox rabbinate as the arbiter of religious authenticity. The ruling forces Orthodox Judaism worldwide to recognize that women can achieve high levels of Talmudic education. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the proliferation of educational programs reflects – and creates – a need within orthodoxy. It is not just a small cadre of women seeking these opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.gratz.edu/news-and-events/event-calendar/default-dynamic-news-page/%7Eboard/news-and-events/post/walderfellowshipcohort\">Programs continue to open</a> because there is a demand among Orthodox women for the chance to study rabbinic texts. As more institutions create programs for women, they are creating a new reality: one where Orthodox women are religious leaders.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261933/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michal Raucher received funding from the Israel Institute, the University of Cincinnati, and the Hadassah Brandeis Institute to conduct research related to this article.</span></em></p>",

And it’s easy to understand their appeal: Ask a question, get a polished synthesis and move on – it feels like effortless learning. </p>\n\n<p>However, a new paper I co-authored offers experimental evidence that this ease may come at a cost: When people rely on large language models to summarize information on a topic for them, they tend to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf316\">develop shallower knowledge</a> about it compared to learning through a standard Google search. </p>\n\n<p>Co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=x0S_vSgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Jin Ho Yun</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=1UnvjWoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">and I</a>, both professors of marketing, reported this finding in a paper based on seven studies with more than 10,000 participants. Most of the studies used the same basic paradigm: Participants were asked to learn about a topic – such as how to grow a vegetable garden – and were randomly assigned to do so by using either an LLM like ChatGPT or the “old-fashioned way,” by navigating links using a standard Google search. </p>\n\n<p>No restrictions were put on how they used the tools; they could search on Google as long as they wanted and could continue to prompt ChatGPT if they felt they wanted more information. Once they completed their research, they were then asked to write advice to a friend on the topic based on what they learned.  </p>\n\n<p>The data revealed a consistent pattern: People who learned about a topic through an LLM versus web search felt that they learned less, invested less effort in subsequently writing their advice, and ultimately wrote advice that was shorter, less factual and more generic. In turn, when this advice was presented to an independent sample of readers, who were unaware of which tool had been used to learn about the topic, they found the advice to be less informative, less helpful, and they were less likely to adopt it. </p>\n\n<p>We found these differences to be robust across a variety of contexts. For example, one possible reason LLM users wrote briefer and more generic advice is simply that the LLM results exposed users to less eclectic information than the Google results. To control for this possibility, we conducted an experiment where participants were exposed to an identical set of facts in the results of their Google and ChatGPT searches. Likewise, in another experiment we held constant the search platform – Google – and varied whether participants learned from standard Google results or Google’s AI Overview feature. </p>\n\n<p>The findings confirmed that, even when holding the facts and platform constant, learning from synthesized LLM responses led to shallower knowledge compared to gathering, interpreting and synthesizing information for oneself via standard web links.  </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Why did the use of LLMs appear to diminish learning? One of the most fundamental principles of skill development is that people learn best when they are <a href=\"https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10321235\">actively engaged with the material</a> they are trying to learn. </p>\n\n<p>When we learn about a topic through Google search, we face much more “friction”: We must navigate different web links, read informational sources, and interpret and synthesize them ourselves. </p>\n\n<p>While more challenging, this friction leads to the development of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-3445.136.4.569\">deeper, more original mental representation</a> of the topic at hand. But with LLMs, this entire process is done on the user’s behalf, transforming learning from a more active to passive process.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p>To be clear, we do not believe the solution to these issues is to avoid using LLMs, especially given the undeniable benefits they offer in many contexts. Rather, our message is that people simply need to become smarter or more strategic users of LLMs – which starts by understanding the domains wherein LLMs are beneficial versus harmful to their goals. </p>\n\n<p>Need a quick, factual answer to a question? Feel free to use your favorite AI co-pilot. But if your aim is to develop deep and generalizable knowledge in an area, relying on LLM syntheses alone will be less helpful. </p>\n\n<p>As part of my research on the psychology of new technology and new media, I am also interested in whether it’s possible to make LLM learning a more active process. In <a href=\"https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/4/10/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgaf316/1/pgaf316_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1766054688&amp;Signature=Xqnv2Q42RUMys-17wZLGfTGKhagRvNecWWw-ddF%7EhNg3mAoMm1ZM78-4Smt7VMdTPH7o3vWWBPA%7Et-5SYa26yPR8%7E1WYsyJ7Q0FGgvubbfC776neCu-W7g4uocv8Yr70xDwGVecHCVEYp7nA8louP2qbTV0FCeho5rx9CWyG%7EJJf29NmkWhfuNMpWkrTSpC-8aiH-G4bAviyW3dgCw5eKHV81063yz6ebK9tueV18tjDGxY1ke05g9MRcKlJfThQTHTiNW9-eN6dUPFvxGasGkw-GxdNKfTDyVv8cJfXY6HI1TCmJHALTM4oam-H5vIVvSzmmvZC7vWZZ2R7XRky6A__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA\">another experiment</a> we tested  this by having participants engage with a specialized GPT model that offered real-time web links alongside its synthesized responses. There, however, we found that once participants received an LLM summary, they weren’t motivated to dig deeper into the original sources. The result was that the participants still developed shallower knowledge compared to those who used standard Google.</p>\n\n<p>Building on this, in my future research I plan to study generative AI tools that impose healthy frictions for learning tasks – specifically, examining which types of guardrails or speed bumps most successfully motivate users to actively learn more beyond easy, synthesized answers. Such tools would seem particularly critical in secondary education, where a major challenge for educators is how best to equip students to develop foundational reading, writing and math skills while also preparing for a real world where LLMs are likely to be an integral part of their daily lives. </p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269760/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shiri Melumad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Imagine a kink in a hose that prevents water passing through it.

When stents are not available, we use powerful medications called thrombolytics, or clot-busters, to break down the thrombus. These kinds of treatments seem commonplace today, but it wasn’t until 1988 that a pivotal study showed combining aspirin and streptokinase, a clot-buster drug, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(88)92833-4\">improved survival after a heart attack</a> by almost 50%. </p>\n\n<p>Cheney had additional heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. Notably, all but the last were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2009.11928531\">during election years</a>, underscoring the detrimental effects of stress on heart health. His heart attack in 2000 occurred as the courts worked to determine whether Al Gore or George W. Bush – with whom Cheney would become vice president – <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/04/dick-cheney-heart-attacks-modern-medicine/87083844007/\">had won the presidential election</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As technology advanced over the years, Cheney had multiple <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22060-angioplasty\">angioplasties</a> – a procedure to open up narrowed or blocked arteries. During an angioplasty, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25270/con.2020.03.00024\">procedure developed in the 1980s</a>, heart doctors would place a balloon made of flexible polymers inside an artery to open up and clear the thrombus.   </p>\n\n<p>While angioplasties were helpful, one of the main limitations was that the walls of the artery would quickly shrink back – known as recoiling – after the balloon was deflated.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration showing treatment of clogged arteries with three steps of angioplasty procedure\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703056/original/file-20251118-56-3fmgms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Angioplasties are procedures used to improve blood flow by widening narrowed or blocked arteries.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/steps-of-angioplasty-with-stent-balloon-in-royalty-free-illustration/2161114389?phrase=heart%20stent&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Rujirat Boonyong/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How stents became mainstream</h2>\n\n<p>That limitation led to the concept of stents – devices that are now frequently used to treat heart attack patients. </p>\n\n<p>Cheney’s first heart attack in 1978 occurred <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.24875/RECICE.M24000463\">well before the first stents</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM19870319316120\">became available</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stents started out as metal, tubelike structures that cardiologists used to open up narrowed or blocked blood vessels. The original stents, made of stainless steel, fixed the problem of blood vessels recoiling. </p>\n\n<p>But over time, cardiologists found that stents become stenotic, meaning they themselves would become narrow, making it difficult for blood to flow through them. This problem was solved with the introduction of drug-eluting stents, which have a polymer that coats the metal struts of a stent and prevents stenosis from occurring. </p>\n\n<p>Drug-eluting stents were a game-changer and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.0000127110.49192.72\">reduced the need for repeated procedures</a> by about 50% to 70%. Like millions of Americans, Cheney received several stents during his long battle with heart disease.  </p>\n\n<p>While stents are helpful, sometimes patients require a surgery called <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\">coronary artery bypass graft</a>. Heart surgeons perform this procedure when there are blockages that angioplasty or a stent cannot fix, or when there are too many blockages in the heart arteries. </p>\n\n<p>In 1988, at age 47, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10772800\">Cheney underwent a quadruple bypass operation</a> to help restore blood flow to his heart following his third heart attack.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a metal stent for implantation into blood vessels.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703054/original/file-20251118-56-y0v06l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Example of a stent being deployed in an artery with stenosis, or narrowing as a result of plaque buildup.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/stent-illustration-royalty-free-illustration/1423887795?phrase=heart%20stent&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Christoph Burgstedt/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Battling heart disease</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the best efforts of cardiologists, many patients with heart disease, like Cheney, go on to develop heart failure. </p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">two main types of heart failure</a>. One – called <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/what-is-heart-failure/types-of-heart-failure\">heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</a> – occurs when the left ventricle, the largest and strongest chamber of the heart, becomes stiff and unable to relax.</p>\n\n<p>The other type – <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/what-is-heart-failure/types-of-heart-failure\">heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</a> – occurs when the left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened, and fails to pump blood efficiently. </p>\n\n<p>Both types of heart failure make it difficult for the heart to adequately pump blood throughout the body. Cheney, like millions of people throughout the world, suffered from a dilated and weakened heart.  </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, now there are several classes of medications used to treat the kind of heart failure that Cheney suffered from.   </p>\n\n<p>There are four main types of drugs that heart failure cardiologists use to manage patients with this condition, which are referred to as the “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">four pillars” of heart failure management</a>. These medications work together to reduce the amount of stress placed on the heart and to create an environment that helps a weakened heart pump blood <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\">more efficiently throughout the body</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to these four medication types, millions of patients with dilated, weak hearts are living much longer with a higher quality of life and staying out of the hospital. Some of these medications are also used for patients with stiffened hearts, but there is a lot of ongoing research to better understand how to take care of patients with that kind of heart failure.  </p>\n\n<p>Despite the use of medications to treat dilated, weak hearts, some patients suffer from continued weakening of the heart muscle and progress to <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/living-with-heart-failure-and-managing-advanced-hf/advanced-heart-failure\">end-stage, or advanced, heart failure</a>. When this happens, there are only two treatment options available. These options are a mechanical pump or a heart transplant.</p>\n\n<p>Heart transplantation is the gold-standard, preferred treatment option for advanced heart failure that results from a dilated, weakened heart.   </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, there were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajt.2025.01.024\">about 4,500 heart transplants in the U.S.</a> and about 2,200 in Europe. On average, patients live well <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2014/02/dick-cheney-on-his-heart-transplant-its-the-gift-of-life-itself.html\">over a decade with a heart transplant</a>, and many will go on to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17087-heart-transplant\">live for 20 to 30 more years</a>.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A smiling woman adjusts her bicycle helmet while a man on a bike sips from a water bottle in the background\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703053/original/file-20251118-56-rnxek.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Major health organizations recommend 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-beautiful-senior-couple-on-bike-ride-in-royalty-free-image/2174119314?phrase=heart%20disease%20&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</h2>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-023-01839-3\">famously quipped</a>, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  </p>\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dick-cheneys-heart/\">interview with “60 Minutes</a>” in 2013, Cheney said his heart disease was the result of genetics and an unhealthy lifestyle. He admitted that he drank beer, ate fatty foods and also smoked three packs of cigarettes per day. </p>\n\n<p>Millions of people across the U.S. and Europe have a lifestyle that is similar to that of Cheney’s prior to his heart transplant. While heart patients benefit from medications, stents and surgeries, <a href=\"https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf\">preventive strategies cannot be underestimated</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Almost all major health organizations, <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults\">including the American Heart Association</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html\">American Cancer Society</a> and the Department of Health and Human Services, recommend 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. </p>\n\n<p>This recommendation translates to a brisk walk about 30 minutes per day, five days per week. This level of exercise leads to large increases in survival and preservation of overall health throughout a lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>While Cheney lived through five heart attacks, the goal for patients and their doctors is to avoid the first. Scientific advances in cardiology have led to a dramatic improvement in survival and quality of life for millions of people, but preventive measures are still by far the most effective lifesaving measure.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269081/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>William Cornwell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In recent years, social psychologists such as <a href=\"https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book\">Jonathan Haidt</a> have started to draw connections between tech use and anxiety. They argue that the ubiquity of smartphones and social media may affect not only the habits and emotions of young people but also key aspects of their brain development during adolescence.</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining a constant online presence can result in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.2020.1743228\">excessive social comparison</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-024-01481-9\">disrupted sleep</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans\">fragmented attention</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.674298\">increased exposure to cyberbullying</a> – all of which can increase the prevalence of anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6eJfXioAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">public health and policy researchers</a> with an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1li36vMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">interest in mental health</a>. We understand that this problem goes well beyond youthful angst. Evidence increasingly links this type of prolonged anxiety to a number of detrimental health issues, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16996-1_6\">weakened immune function</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-016-0739-5\">increased cardiovascular risk</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-01986-4\">impaired cognitive performance</a>. Over time, these effects can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.9817\">increase the risk of chronic illness and other negative health outcomes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, in May 2025 we <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-health-anxiety-supplement-survey-results-2025.pdf\">conducted our own survey</a> to measure the prevalence of anxiety in the state where we live, Florida, and explore whether it is, in fact, related to age and social media use.</p>\n\n<h2>What our survey asked</h2>\n\n<p>We surveyed 500 adults, and we designed our research to ensure that our survey group matched the state’s population in terms of age, race, gender, political affiliation and geographic distribution.</p>\n\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://adaa.org/sites/default/files/GAD-7_Anxiety-updated_0.pdf\">a questionnaire called the GAD-7</a>, which was developed by mental health professionals to assess symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. The GAD-7 asks participants to identify how bothered they were about seven items during the past two weeks. They answered on a four-point scale, from “not at all” to “nearly everyday.” These seven items included questions on worrying, irritability, restlessness and feeling afraid or on edge.</p>\n\n<p>A score under 10 indicates minimal (0-4) or mild (5-9) anxiety. Those who score between 10 and 14 exhibit moderate anxiety, while a score of 15 or higher is indicative of a severe anxiety disorder. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between moderate and severe generalized anxiety corresponds to how often the participant experiences any of the seven items. For example, someone with severe generalized anxiety might experience all seven items nearly every day, while someone with moderate generalized anxiety might have experienced some of the items several days in the past two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>We also asked participants about how much time they spend on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and how they feel while using these platforms.</p>\n\n<h2>What we found</h2>\n\n<p>Our survey found that roughly 1 in 5 Floridians are struggling with moderate to severe anxiety, which is consistent with <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder\">national statistics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the average GAD-7 score was 4.74 – this would indicate that the “average” Floridian doesn’t have an anxiety disorder – 18.6% of participants reported symptoms of at least moderate anxiety, with nearly half of them rising to the level of severe.</p>\n\n<p>This result tells us that nearly 3.5 million Floridians may suffer from clinically significant anxiety.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Dzfp1\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Dzfp1/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Members of <a href=\"https://www.beresfordresearch.com/age-range-by-generation/\">Generation Z</a>, ages 18 to 27 in our sample, reported the highest rates of anxiety by a significant margin. In fact, the average GAD-7 score for this group was 8.17 – just below the threshold for moderate anxiety – compared with an average of 6.50 for millennials, 5.32 for Gen Xers and 3.04 for baby boomers. </p>\n\n<p>These averages track with previous nationwide studies, which have found that the portion of the U.S. adult population that suffers the most anxiety are members of Gen Z. According to a study conducted in 2020, 30.9% of adults ages 18 to 23 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10804-023-09442-x\">reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms</a>, compared to only 27.9% of millennials, 17.2% of Gen Xers and 8.1% of baby boomers.</p>\n\n<h2>Social media and anxiety in Gen Z</h2>\n\n<p>In order to understand whether social media use might help explain the higher rates of anxiety we observed among younger Floridians, we examined the relationship between time spent on social media and anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>In general, those who didn’t use social media at all reported lower levels of anxiety, with an average GAD-7 score of 3.56. In comparison, the average GAD-7 score for those who use social media less than one hour per week was 3.74, and it rose consistently as social media use increased, climbing to an average of 6.10 among those who spent seven to nine hours a week on social media, and 7.08 for those who were logged on for 10 hours or more.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"1h0tZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1h0tZ/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>While time spent was important, the reasons why Floridians use social media also made a big difference in whether they experienced anxiety. Anxiety was lowest among those who use social media primarily to stay connected with family and friends. But it rose significantly among those who use social media to stay up to date with current trends and pop culture or to learn about health, fitness and beauty trends.</p>\n\n<p>We also asked respondents whether they “sometimes feel like they’re missing out when they see what others post on social media.” Among those who agreed that they sometimes get social media <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i19.4881\">FOMO</a>, average anxiety scores ranged between 7.26 and 9.00. But among those who disagreed, average scores were significantly lower – 4.16 or less.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"76hNb\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/76hNb/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Time spent on social media matters for young people</h2>\n\n<p>In this data, we see a clear correlation between social media use and heightened anxiety, and we also see a greater tendency for Gen Zers and millennials to report higher levels of anxiety. This makes sense, given that younger people generally spend more time on social media.</p>\n\n<p>But one important question remained to be answered: Can reducing social media use lead to lower rates of anxiety for the youngest adults? </p>\n\n<p>In order to answer this question, we reexamined the relationship between average weekly social media use and anxiety. But this time, we restricted the analysis to only those respondents who were members of the Gen Z and millennial groups.</p>\n\n<p>Even when the study was restricted to just these two groups, we found a clear and decisive link between social media use and anxiety. Those who reported spending less than one hour on social media each week had average GAD-7 scores of 2.89. Those scores rose consistently as time on social media increased, reaching a high of 8.73 among those who use social media 10 hours or more per week.</p>\n\n<h2>Moderating intake to bring down anxiety</h2>\n\n<p>The results of our survey appear to confirm the suspicions of social psychologists and techno-critics – namely, that the high rates of anxiety observed among younger Americans appear to be connected to their time online. This is particularly true for those spending time in digital spaces that facilitate social comparison and information overload.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be sure from just this survey that social media alone is to blame for increased generalized anxiety. Other factors may be involved, such as digital information overload and a decline in person-to-person contact. But the amount of time spent on social media does appear to be affecting the mental health of young people in Florida. </p>\n\n<p>One potential solution may be to moderate intake. Some emerging research has suggested <a href=\"https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/yvcb5y06/release/2\">setting up automated daily reminders</a> to limit social media use to 30 minutes a day. Another suggestion includes occasionally <a href=\"https://www.annalembke.com/dopamine-nation\">taking a monthlong break from social media</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Those who feel they need more support taking time off social media may benefit from seeking professional help, such as talking with a licensed therapist.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263010/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stephen Neely receives funding from the Florida Center for Cybersecurity for this study</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kaila Witkowski receives funding from the Florida Center for Cybersecurity for this study. </span></em></p>",

How do you learn what you know about MAGA?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://sasn.rutgers.edu/alex-hinton\">a cultural anthropologist</a>, and what we do is field work. We go where the people we’re studying live, act, talk. We observe and sort of hang out and see what happens. We listen and then we unpack themes. We try and understand the meaning systems that undergird whatever group we’re studying.

Are they, in fact, concerned about this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The answer is yes, but there’s also a sort of “no” implicit, too. We need to back up and think, first of all, what is MAGA. </p>\n\n<p>I think of it as what we call in anthropology a nativist movement, a foregrounding of the people in the land. And this is where you get <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/what-exactly-meant-america-first-1866209\">America First discourse</a>. It’s also xenophobic, meaning that there’s a fear of outsiders, invaders coming in. It’s populist, so it’s something that’s sort of for the people. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.happyscribe.com/the-tucker-carlson-show/tucker-and-mtg-on-the-5-pillars-of-maga-and-the-snakes-in-washington-trying-to-tear-them-down\">Tucker Carlson interviewed Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, and he said, “I’m going to go over the five pillars of MAGA.” Those were America First, this is absolutely central. Borders was the second. You’ve got to secure the borders. The third was globalist antipathy, or a recognition that globalization has failed. Another one was free speech, and another one he mentioned was no more foreign wars. And I would add into that an emphasis on “we the people” versus elites. </p>\n\n<p>Each of those is interwoven with a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/maga-media-conspiracy-theories-put-120855227.html\">key dynamic to MAGA, which is conspiracy theory</a>. And those conspiracy theories are usually anti-elite, going back to we the people. </p>\n\n<p>If you look at Epstein, he’s where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx5xzy8kn1o\">many of the conspiracy theories converge</a>: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-55009950\">Stop the Steal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/power-of-trumps-big-lie-identity-fusion-internalizing-misinformation-and-support-for-trump/AF2A0DBE08319E0E3944825E187EDBCC\">The Big Lie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/prosecute-the-architects-of-trump-lawfare-for-election-interference/\">lawfare</a>, <a href=\"https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EA1C41B2CE4E423BC9AFBB36640AE430/9781009355285c4_170-195.pdf/trump-and-after.pdf\">deep state</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/g-s1-22583/trump-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory\">replacement theory</a>. Epstein kind of hits all of these, that there’s this elite cabal that’s orchestrating things that ultimately are against the interests of we the people, with a sort of antisemitic strain to this. And in particular, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/09/why-maga-is-obsessed-with-jeffrey-epstein-00134394\">if we go back to Pizzagate in 2016</a>, this conspiracy theory that there were these Democratic elitists who were, you know, demonic forces who were sex trafficking, and lo and behold, here’s Epstein doing precisely that. </p>\n\n<p><strong>There’s kind of a bucket of these things, and Epstein is more in it than not in it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>He’s all over it. He’s been there, you know, from the beginning, because he’s elite and they believe he’s doing sex trafficking. And then there’s a suspicion of the deep state, of the government, and this means cover-ups. What was MAGA promised? <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">Trump said, we’re going to give you the goods</a>, right? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5508871/trump-bondi-epstein-files-release-history\">Kash Patel, Pam Bondi, everyone said</a> we’re going to tell you this stuff. And it sure smacks of a cover-up, if you just look at it.</p>\n\n<p>But the bottom line is there’s a realization among many people in MAGA that you’ve got to stay with Trump. It’s too much to say there is no MAGA without Trump. There’s certainly no Trumpism without Trump, but MAGA without Trump would be like the tea party. It’ll just sort of fade away without Trump. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/politics/trump-epstein-republican-care-poll\">People in MAGA are supporting Trump</a> more than more mainstream Republicans on this. So I don’t think there’s going to be a break over this, but it certainly adds strain. And you can see in the current moment that Trump is under some strain.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A blond woman in a red hat speaks at a microphone while a man in a suit stands behind her, with American flags behind him.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703119/original/file-20251118-56-v68y1n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep.

You fall apart, you have tension, and then you sort of get back. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elon-musk-backs-off-from-feud-with-trump-saying-he-regrets-social-media-posts-that-went-too-far\">Elon Musk was a little bit like that</a>. You have this breakup, and now she’s sort of backtracking like Elon Musk did. I don’t think what is happening is indicative of a larger fracturing that’s going to take place with MAGA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It seems that Trump did his about-face on releasing the documents so that MAGA doesn’t have to break with him.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s absolutely true. He’s incredible at taking any story and turning it in his direction. He’s sort of like a chess player, unless he blurts something out. He’s a couple of moves ahead of wherever, whatever’s running, and so in a way we’re always behind, and he knows where we are. It’s incredible that he’s able to do this. </p>\n\n<p>There’s one other thing about MAGA. I think of it as “don’t cross the boss.” It’s this sort of overzealous love of Trump that has to be expressed, and literally no one ever crosses the boss in these contexts. You toe the line, and if you go against the line, you know what happened to Marjorie Taylor Greene, there’s the threat Trump is going to disown you. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-threatens-primary-indiana-republicans-173838011.html\">You’re going to get primaried</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump has probably made a brilliant strategic move, which is suddenly to say, “I’m all for releasing it. It’s actually the Democrats who are these evil elites, and now we’re going to investigate Bill Clinton and all these other Democrats.” He takes over the narrative, he knows how to do it, and it’s intentional. Whoever says Trump is not charismatic, he doesn’t make sense – Trump is highly charismatic. He can move a crowd. He knows what he’s doing. Never underestimate him. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Does MAGA care about girls who were sexually abused?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is concern, you know, especially among the devout Christians in MAGA, for whom sex trafficking is a huge issue. </p>\n\n<p>I think if you look at sort of notions of Christian morality, it also goes to notions of sort of innocence, being afflicted by demonic forces. And it’s an attack on we the people by those elites; it’s a violation of rights. I mean, who isn’t horrified by the idea of sex trafficking? But again, especially in the Christian circles, this is a huge issue.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270109/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alex Hinton receives funding from the Rutgers-Newark Sheila Y.

Pecans have grown more popular over the decades, and you will probably encounter them in some form this holiday season. </p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1A45uDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">an extension specialist</a> in Oklahoma, a state consistently ranked fifth in pecan production, behind <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/pecan-production-by-state\">Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.</a> I’ll admit that I am not a fan of the taste of pecans, which leaves more for the squirrels, crows and enthusiastic pecan lovers. </p>\n\n<h2>The spread of pecans</h2>\n\n<p>The pecan is a nut <a href=\"https://www.hardwoodinfo.com/specifying-professionals/species-guide/species-guide-h-z/hickory-pecan/\">related to the hickory</a>. Actually, though we call them nuts, pecans are actually a type of fruit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/nov/10/hips-haws-and-drupes-when-is-a-nut-not-a-nut\">called a drupe</a>.

Three years later, George Washington’s estate, Mount Vernon, had some planted pecans. <a href=\"https://www.uapress.ua.edu/9780817388966/pecan/\">Washington loved pecans</a>, and Revolutionary War soldiers said he was constantly eating them.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, no one needed to plant pecans in the South, since they naturally grew along riverbanks and in groves. Pecan trees are alternate bearing: They will have a <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/pecan-crop-load-management.html\">very large crop one year</a>, followed by one or two very small crops. But because they naturally produced a harvest with <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">no input from farmers</a>, people did not need to actively cultivate them. Locals would harvest nuts for themselves but otherwise ignored the self-sufficient trees.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until the late 1800s that people in the pecan’s native range realized the pecan’s potential worth for income and trade. Harvesting pecans <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">became competitive</a>, and young boys would climb onto precarious tree branches. One girl was lifted by a hot air balloon so she could beat on the upper branches of trees and let them fall to collectors below. <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">Pecan poaching</a> was a problem in natural groves on private property. </p>\n\n<h2>Pecan cultivation begins</h2>\n\n<p>Even with so obvious a demand, cultivated orchards in the South were still rare into the 1900s. Pecan trees don’t produce <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/training-pecan-trees.html\">nuts for several years</a> after planting, so their future quality is unknown. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two lines of trees\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702337/original/file-20251113-56-927nre.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An orchard of pecan trees.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/beautiful-rows-of-pecan-trees-on-orchard-farm-in-royalty-free-image/1695762143?phrase=pecan%20tree&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Jon Frederick/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To guarantee quality nuts, farmers began using a technique called grafting; they’d join branches from quality trees to another pecan tree’s trunk.

One ounce of pecans has the same amount of protein as <a href=\"https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods\">2 ounces of meat</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After the wars, pecan demand declined, resulting in millions of excess pounds at harvest. One effort to increase demand was a national pecan recipe contest in 1924. Over 21,000 submissions came from over 5,000 cooks, with <a href=\"https://lancasteronline.com/features/800-proved-pecan-recipes/article_4e7e036c-6a87-11e4-9d79-43e3bd34d9db.html\">800 of them published in a book</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Pecan consumption went up with the inclusion of pecans <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">in commercially prepared foods</a> and the start of the mail-order industry in the 1870s, as pecans can be shipped and stored at room temperature. That characteristic also put them on some <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/space-food-pecans-apollo-16-white/nasm_A19860760000\">Apollo missions</a>. Small amounts of pecans contain many vitamins and minerals. They became commonplace in cereals, which touted their health benefits. </p>\n\n<p>In 1938, the federal government published the pamphlet Nuts and How to Use Them, which touted pecans’ nutritional value and came <a href=\"https://ia801906.us.archive.org/20/items/nutswaystousethe302whit/nutswaystousethe302whit.pdf\">with recipes</a>. Food writers suggested using pecans as shortening because they are composed mostly of fat. </p>\n\n<p>The government even put a price ceiling on pecans to encourage consumption, but consumers weren’t buying them. The government <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292762183/\">ended up buying</a> the surplus pecans and integrating them into the National School Lunch Program.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A machine with an arm attached to a tree, and a wheeled cab on the ground.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702339/original/file-20251113-56-txazeq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Today, pecan producers use machines called tree shakers to shake pecans out of the trees.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pecan-tree-shaker-machine-royalty-free-image/1201007175?phrase=pecan%20tree%20shaker&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Christine_Kohler/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While you are sitting around the Thanksgiving table this year, you can discuss one of the biggest controversies in the pecan industry: Are they <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/article/pecan-pronunciation/\">PEE-cans or puh-KAHNS</a>?</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268976/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shelley Mitchell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Our research has found that for many African American families, those costs take an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">extra big bite out of their incomes</a>. This bite, the percentage of a household’s income used to pay energy bills, is called a household’s “energy burden.”</p>\n\n<p>Households with high energy burdens struggle to adapt to rising prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that more than 12 million households <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%2011.1.pdf\">keep their homes either colder or hotter</a> than is actually comfortable, specifically in an effort to keep control of energy costs. And 24 million households report having had to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%2011.1.pdf\">forgo food or medicine</a> at least once in the past year to pay utility bills.</p>\n\n<p>Also, studies indicate that people facing high energy burdens often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205356119\">turn to unsafe heating sources</a>, such as space heaters, stoves or fireplaces, and are at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.08.011\">higher risk of</a> asthma, depression, premature mortality and poor self-reported health. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">Our recent study</a> of 2019 data found that those burdens are not spread evenly across the country or across society. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, families living in majority-Black census tracts spent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">5.1% of their income on energy</a> – significantly higher than the 3.2% share spent by average American households. Census tracts dominated by other racial groups in our study – whites, Latinos and Asian Americans – were much closer to the overall average.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26032696/embed\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26032696/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/26032696\" target=\"_top\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\"> </a></div>\n\n<h2>Energy injustice</h2>\n\n<p>Often, disparities like this are attributed to income, which is indeed a factor given that Black households have a <a href=\"https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/united-states-median-household-income-by-race/\">median income of $53,444</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/united-states-median-household-income/\">overall median in the U.S. is $78,538</a>. However, our study found that even when a majority-white and a majority-Black census tract had the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.104207\">same median household income</a>, the average share of household income spent on energy was higher in the majority-Black census tract.</p>\n\n<p>We found two possible reasons for this difference, both rooted in race and housing situations.</p>\n\n<p>First, our analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that African American-majority census tracts have older homes on average than other census tracts. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9951\">Older homes often have lower energy efficiency</a> due to less insulation, single-pane windows, and gaps and cracks in the building’s structure, especially around windows, doors and chimneys. So even if a Black family earns the same income as another family, the Black family might live in an older house, requiring them to use more energy to warm or cool their homes, cook food, heat water and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we found that Black families are more likely to live in rental properties, where they cannot easily make energy-efficiency upgrades – such as installing new windows, insulation or appliances. At the same time, most landlords <a href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/2024-04-24/landlords-renters-incentive-climate-action\">do not have an incentive</a> to spend money to improve building efficiency because tenants usually pay utility bills. In the United States, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%209.2.pdf\">9 in 10 rental households pay for all or some of their energy bills</a> and therefore face this split-incentive problem.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A close-up of brickwork near a window, showing cracks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701517/original/file-20251110-66-faxoeh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Cracks around windows can allow cold air inside.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/damages-cracked-red-brown-brick-wall-at-window-royalty-free-image/2189953242\">Robbie Becklund/iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many of these challenges can be attributed to the structural racism inherent in <a href=\"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/\">redlining</a>. This early 20th century practice made it harder for prospective homeowners to get mortgages to buy homes in neighborhoods with high concentrations of Black people, immigrants or other minorities. That left more of the homes in those communities <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118180\">owned by landlords and occupied by tenants</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even though redlining was banned in 1968, it left a <a href=\"https://ncrc.org/holc/\">legacy of underinvestment</a> in properties, <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/home-values-redlined-areas-19674/\">decreased property values</a> and <a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/articles/spotlight/research/50-years-after-being-outlawed-redlining-still-drives-neighborhood-health-inequities\">worse health outcomes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Intersecting inequities</h2>\n\n<p>Other factors also likely intersect to impose a higher energy burden on Black families. Many of these were beyond the scope of our study but are well documented. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2202/1944-2858.1095\">energy support programs are notoriously underfunded and often hard to access</a>, especially for families without the time or connections to know about them or understand application requirements.</p>\n\n<p>These are just some possible factors that increase the energy burden for Black families. The main lesson for policymakers is that communities are complicated. Energy efficiency upgrade programs that also seek to alleviate high energy burdens cannot be one-size-fits-all. A program for middle-class families in one neighborhood may not work in another community with older housing stock or large numbers of rental units. </p>\n\n<p>To be successful, local officials designing programs that are aimed at  families’ energy burdens will have to learn about the different challenges facing each distinct community – whether it’s leaky older homes, outdated water heaters, low incomes or rental split incentives. Reducing energy burdens for Black families will take more than technical fixes; it will take policies based in community engagement to build a deeper understanding of place.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269047/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

These funding cuts were further exacerbated by the extensive <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/all-government-shutdowns-disrupt-science-in-2025-the-consequences-extend-far-beyond-a-lapse-in-funding-267182\">2025 government shutdown</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a team of sociologists <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rZsAGT4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">studying universities</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KgTHhTMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">higher education policy and administration</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b7-cGVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">academic freedom</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PiwNMGkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">science production</a>, we recognized these cuts as part of a recent global trend of weakened academic freedom. Since the mid-2000s, political attacks on higher education have increased in many countries. Consequently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25593/open-fau-1637\">academic freedom has declined</a> in countries as different as India, Israel, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom, <a href=\"https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/resources/free-to-think-2025/\">among others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, for years Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán accused the internationally respected <a href=\"https://www.ceu.edu\">Central European University</a> of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45976454\">liberal bias</a>.” By 2019, he had effectively forced the university and its faculty into exile in Vienna, Austria. Since Argentinian President Javier Milei came to power in 2023, he has made repeated <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-protests-universities-farright-explained-e442fecf9f66da7508b8686b756847d3\">claims that academics are corrupt elites</a>. He used this narrative to restrict universities’ autonomy and funding of their research programs.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/scientists-around-the-world-report-millions-of-new-discoveries-every-year-but-this-explosive-research-growth-wasnt-what-experts-predicted-237274\">most research is done collaboratively</a>. But research finds that when <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298370\">individual scholars have less academic freedom</a> and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5460496\">universities’ autonomy declines</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.22\">global research collaborations are also threatened</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The prevalence and complexity of those collaborations that optimize human and material resources has grown, with substantial impact on scientific productivity — what we call the global “collaboration dividend.” Collaborations foster solutions to complex problems, from vaccine development to renewable energy. Diminishing academic freedom erodes these collaboration dividends, which then reduces the quantity and quality of scientific discovery worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-concerning-status-higher-education-teaching-personnel\">recommendation concerning the status of higher education teaching personnel</a> builds on Article 26 of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and urges governments to protect academics from political surveillance and interference on two levels.</p>\n\n<p>First, UNESCO affirms the right of individual faculty to teach, research, share findings and express their expert opinions independently. Second, UNESCO recognizes the right of universities to autonomously make decisions about facilitating research, hiring and promoting faculty, and developing curricula without state interference.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic freedom and global collaborations</h2>\n\n<p>Data from <a href=\"https://www.v-dem.net/our-work/research-programs/academic-freedom/\">the Varieties of Democracy, or V-DEM, project</a> demonstrate international trends in academic freedom. V-DEM is a large, widely used international dataset based on experts evaluating political developments. It tracks infringements and protections of these rights in every country over the past hundred years. The index we used measures dimensions of academic freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Suppressed in the 1930s by <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/great-depression\">global economic depression</a>, <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-02695-4.html?srsltid=AfmBOorZr5Co-C7mTXGdIzq-6Xbz-8xndQgI1zUr72TLlwD54IutCmSC\">rising fascism and military conflict</a>, academic freedom reached a low point during World War II. It then rebounded and grew strongly. </p>\n\n<p>More countries began recognizing the benefits of free inquiry and guaranteed independent science, especially from 1980 to the mid-2000s. Nations everywhere expanded the capacity of their universities to undertake scientific research and collaborate across boundaries. <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/books/edited-volume/12050/The-Century-of-ScienceThe-Global-Triumph-of-the\">A new global model of the research university</a> fostered the exponential growth of scientific knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"f9yvF\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f9yvF/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Also, in part as a defense against totalitarianism, many countries signed on to international agreements upholding academic freedom, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-economic-social-and-cultural-rights\">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. This agreement declares that the basic human right to an education “can only be enjoyed if accompanied by the academic freedom of staff and students.” </p>\n\n<p>The strengthening of academic freedom paralleled the largest historical expansion of the world’s capacity to undertake research on science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine, or STEMM. But over the past decade, freedoms of faculty members and universities began to weaken in many countries, including in the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/5-growing-threats-to-academic-freedom-230185\">United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/global-mega-science\">university-based scientists co-author 85% to 90%</a> of the several million STEMM research papers produced annually. Large, complex collaborations are increasingly a driving force in discovery. The global expansion of academic freedom enables universities and their scientists to participate in this intensifying collaboration dividend through joint research with colleagues elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>In studies published between 2024 and 2025, we presented troubling trends about declining academic freedom, collaborations and scientific research at universities in countries across the world. </p>\n\n<p>First, we analyzed individual academic freedom and STEMM production in 17 research productive countries from 1981 to 2007. We found that academic freedom protections <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298370\">raise the quantity and quality of research</a>, while infringements on these safeguards lower them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we found that safeguarding universities’ organizational autonomy also <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5460496\">increases the volume and excellence</a> of a country’s STEMM research output. Both associations are independent of other influential factors behind countries’ scientific productivity, such as governmental research spending, a country’s wealth or university enrollments.</p>\n\n<p>Third, a related study by others finds that restricting academic freedom <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.22\">reduces scientists’ and universities’ ability</a> to effectively participate in international research collaborations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A screen showing the headshots of three researchers at a Nobel Prize announcement ceremony.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699312/original/file-20251029-56-gm8xfq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Nobel Prizes often are awarded to interorganizational and/or international teams of researchers, such as the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde\">Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency via AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Diminishing the collaboration dividend</h2>\n\n<p>Together, these findings underscore that academic freedom allows researchers to participate in complex collaborations, which in turn increases research production. Most of these collaborations aren’t just facilitated by individual scientists, however. Global collaborations are made up of networks of universities, and declining academic freedom can threaten the ties between these institutions and their scientists’ projects. </p>\n\n<p>The popular image of the solitary genius making isolated breakthroughs is largely a myth. Research teams have steadily increased in size, and “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2478/jdis-2023-0015\">super-collaborative” groups</a> of hundreds or even thousands of scientists now work together on complex projects. Together, they produce ever greater amounts of knowledge. Because individual researchers’ output is fairly steady over their careers, real productivity gains in science now <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16835\">depend on global collaboration and shared resources</a>. This is true even as the number of scientists grows. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=284&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699319/original/file-20251029-56-7m83wm.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=357&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Research collaborations spanning the globe, with research hubs of mostly universities visible (mapping of bibliographic pairs on the basis of Scopus data).</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Olivier H. Beauchesne, used with permission</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the early 1980s, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-025-09602-1\">three geographical superhubs</a> of robust, primarily university-based collaborative research emerged. One is Europe, another is North America. The third, East Asia, is growing rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>By 1980, universities in the European and North American hubs collaborated on publications with scientists in 100 other countries. This number grew to 193 countries by 2010. Currently, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-025-09602-1\">over a fourth of the millions of annual STEMM papers</a> are the result of international collaborations. This process is heavily dependent on universities and their freedom to pursue science.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, superhubs can accelerate international collaboration for scientists in other countries not originally in these hubs. Such collaborations enable their universities to leapfrog into new superhub status. <a href=\"https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/28573\">South Korean universities</a> have been an example of this process over the past several decades.</p>\n\n<p>This collaborative capacity has enabled the production of millions of co-authored papers and scientific advances. For instance, these collaborations allowed for the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.101\">rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Collaborative networks depend on university support, not just individual scientists. This is why our research suggests declining academic freedom at the university level makes them vulnerable. A troubling <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00938-y\">three-quarters of U.S.-based scientists</a> have considered leaving the country in response to threats against academic freedom in the U.S. since early 2025. </p>\n\n<p>This research suggests that at stake here is not only the freedom of scholars and academic institutions, but also the future of discovery itself. Academic freedom is essential for scientists around the world to collaborate, enabling the scientific discoveries necessary for technological innovation, medical breakthroughs, and social and environmental problem-solving.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266644/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Volha Chykina has received funding from Mellon Foundation / Scholars at Risk to support her research on academic freedom.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David P.

You’re exhausted but elated. The view of the city below is gorgeous, and you want to capture the moment on camera. But it’s already quite dark, and you’re not sure you’ll get a good shot. Fortunately, your phone has an AI-powered night mode that can take stunning photos even after sunset. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s something you might not know: That night mode may have been trained on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.02715\">synthetic nighttime images</a>, computer-generated scenes that were never actually photographed.</p>\n\n<p>As artificial intelligence researchers exhaust the supply of real data on the web and in digitized archives, they are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-synthetic-data-industry-debate-over-fake-2024-8\">increasingly turning to synthetic data</a>, artificially generated examples that mimic real ones. But that creates a paradox. In science, making up data is a cardinal sin. Fake data and misinformation are already undermining trust in information online. So how can synthetic data possibly be good? Is it just a polite euphemism for deception?</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ttbl4FsAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">machine learning researcher</a>, I think the answer lies in intent and transparency. Synthetic data is generally not created to manipulate results or mislead people. In fact, ethics may require AI companies to use synthetic data: Releasing real human face images, for example, can violate privacy, whereas <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.061\">synthetic faces</a> can offer similar benefit with formal privacy guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>There are other reasons that help explain the growing use of synthetic data in training AI models. Some things are so scarce or rare that they are barely represented in real data. Rather than letting these gaps become an Achilles’ heel, researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV45572.2020.9093570\">can simulate those situations instead</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another motivation is that collecting real data can be costly or even risky. Imagine collecting data for a self-driving car during storms or on unpaved roads. It is often much more efficient, and far safer, to <a href=\"https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/auto-self-driving-safety-report.pdf\">generate such data virtually</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIusawrGBN4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Here’s a quick take on what synthetic data is and why researchers and developers use it.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How synthetic data is made</h2>\n\n<p>Training an AI model requires large amounts of data. Like students and athletes, the more an AI is trained, the better its performance tends to be. Researchers have known for a long time that if data is in short supply, they can use a technique known as <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/complete-guide-data-augmentation\">data augmentation</a>. For example, a given image can be rotated or scaled to yield additional training data. Synthetic data is data augmentation on steroids. Instead of making small alterations to existing images, researchers create entirely new ones.</p>\n\n<p>But how do researchers create synthetic data? There are two main approaches. The first approach relies on rule-based or <a href=\"https://rendered.ai/why-synthetic-data-is-used-to-train-computer-vision/\">physics-based models</a>. For example, the laws of optics can be used to simulate how a scene would appear given the positions and orientations of objects within it. </p>\n\n<p>The second approach uses <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3275134\">generative AI to produce data</a>. Modern generative models are trained on vast amounts of data and can now create remarkably realistic text, audio, images and videos. Generative AI offers a flexible way to produce large and diverse datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Both approaches share a common principle: If data does not come directly from the real world, it must come from a realistic model of the world. </p>\n\n<h2>Downsides and dangers</h2>\n\n<p>It is also important to remember that while synthetic data can be useful, it is not a panacea. Synthetic data is only as reliable as the models of reality it comes from, and even the best scientific or generative models <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/streamline-accelerate-ai-initiatives-synthetic-data\">have weaknesses</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers have to be careful about potential biases and inaccuracies in the data they produce. For example, researchers may simulate the home-insurance ecosystem to help detect fraud, but those simulations could embed unfair assumptions about neighborhoods or property types. The benefits of such data must be weighed against risks to fairness and equity.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also important to maintain a clear distinction between models and simulations on one hand and the real world on the other. Synthetic data is invaluable for training and testing AI systems, but when an AI model is deployed in the real world, its performance and safety should be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.03257\">proved with real, not simulated, data</a> for both technical and ethical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Future research on synthetic data in AI is likely to face many challenges. Some are ethical, some are scientific, and others are engineering problems. As synthetic data becomes more realistic, it will be more useful for training AI, but it will also be easier to misuse. For example, increasingly realistic synthetic images can be used to create convincing <a href=\"https://security.virginia.edu/deepfakes\">deepfake videos</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that researchers and AI companies should keep clear records to show which data is synthetic and why it was created. Clearly disclosing which parts of the training data are real and which are synthetic is a key aspect of responsibly producing AI models. California’s law, “<a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2013\">Generative artificial intelligence: training data transparency</a>,” set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, requires AI developers to disclose if they used synthetic data in training their models.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.03257\">Researchers should also study</a> how mistakes in simulations or models can lead to bad data. Careful work will help keep synthetic data transparent, trustworthy and reliable. </p>\n\n<h2>Keeping it real</h2>\n\n<p>Most AI systems learn by finding patterns in data. Researchers can improve their ability to do this by adding synthetic data. But AI has no sense of what is real or true. The desire to stay in touch with reality and to seek truth belongs to people, not machines. <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/publications/reducing-risks-posed-synthetic-content-overview-technical-approaches-digital-content\">Human judgment and oversight</a> in the use of synthetic data will remain essential for the future.</p>\n\n<p>The next time you use a cool AI feature on your smartphone, think about whether synthetic data might have played a role. Our AIs may learn from synthetic data, but reality remains the ultimate source of our knowledge and the final judge of our creations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265180/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ambuj Tewari receives funding from NSF and NIH.</span></em></p>",

At the time, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17541328.2011.625195\">Mariana Waddy</a>, a student at San Francisco State University and the first president of a Black student union, said, “This college had done little for Black students except try to whitewash them.” </p>\n\n<p>Black students wanted to make the school more engaging and responsive to their needs. </p>\n\n<p>Today, these student unions are essential for Black student life on college campuses. They offer a place of belonging, where Black students can figuratively exhale from a predominately white campus or student environment. Black student life on campus isn’t a given – just because there are Black students, it doesn’t mean there is a Black student community. These unions allow Black students to come together as a community.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What do these unions look like and do, day to day?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Black student unions largely operate independently. They have various events, like cookouts and parties. If a campus is dealing with an issue or some kind of racist occurrence, for example, Black student union leaders will come to the forefront to be an advocate for Black students. They try to engage with students and university leaders on whatever is happening. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How are political pressure and policy shifts influencing these unions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/09/29/students-alumni-rally-keep-cut-affinity-programs-alive\">University of Utah</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/black-student-unions-us-schools\">University of Alabama</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/black-student-unions-us-schools\">announced in 2024</a> that they would no longer fund or support their schools’ Black student unions. Universities typically give these unions a certain amount of money, as they do with other student-led groups. With this funding pulled, it is going to make it harder for Black student unions to exist. Where are they going to meet? Will they have to pay for a place to meet off campus? </p>\n\n<p>And if you want to encourage students to come to Black student events, you will likely want to have food for them. If you want to arrange a trip to a conference or host a movie night, those things cost money and require space.</p>\n\n<p>These cuts have drained time, energy and resources from Black student unions. </p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.northerniowan.com/23450/black-history-month/black-student-union-is-filling-the-gaps/\">Black student leaders</a> are <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/09/29/students-alumni-rally-keep-cut-affinity-programs-alive\">filling gaps</a> where funding, staff, spaces and infrastructure used to exist to support and meet the needs of Black student life.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\">administration’s attempts</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei\">remove funding</a> from and shut down diversity, equity and inclusion programs could lead Black student union leaders to act as <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/segregation-or-student-support\">unpaid diversity workers</a> if and when these positions at universities are eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>This work also involves organizing social events and support services for Black students. It means continuing to creatively advocate for Black student needs.  </p>\n\n<p>Full-time students leading Black student unions now find themselves doing unpaid labor that helps sustain Black communities and the universities that profit from them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How exactly are universities profiting from Black student unions’ work?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Here’s one example: <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/B/Black-Campus-Life2\">I observed</a> a university tapping student leaders from a Black engineering group to represent the university’s school of engineering at public events. These leaders might have had to skip class or lose study time to be available for this event. But the university wanted other people, including prospective Black students, to know that there were already Black students at this school. </p>\n\n<p>Black students in these positions have mentioned to me that sometimes administrators will pressure them to show up for panels and other events as a form of marketing. I think most of these requests are well-meaning. But I also know that Black student representatives and leaders place pressure on themselves to also show up for their community and school. </p>\n\n<p>Their presence and visibility help universities have a more welcoming environment. They have an active, vibrant community because of Black student unions and leaders. Organizations like this create community and lead to more positive experiences for students. This <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/785238\">joy can lead</a> to more students staying in school. </p>\n\n<p>If I am a Black parent touring a college with my child and don’t see any Black students participating in the tour or on campus, that sends a message to a prospective Black student – will I, or my child, belong here? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What message are Black student unions receiving with these policy shifts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the message to Black student unions is that you all have to fend for yourselves. That is what inequality is all about, having different expectations for different students. </p>\n\n<p>Cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion work signals to Black students that they are not valued and that, if they want to have meaningful experiences as a Black student community, they will have to do this work themselves. You can discern an institution’s values in their budget priorities. If there is nothing being materially invested in Black students, how can you say you support them?</p>\n\n<p>My research shows that Black students act independently to achieve their goals. They create <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/rhe.2021.0003\">places of joy</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0042085920971354\">and belonging</a> for themselves and others, <a href=\"https://sunypress.edu/Books/B/Black-Campus-Life2\">navigating institutions</a> to create full, dynamic lives.</p>\n\n<p>Black students have historically played the cards they were dealt, even if they were inequitable. They have worked to create traditions and lives within and outside of higher education’s campus walls. Some Black student unions may look different going forward, but I have full faith they will continue.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268754/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Antar A.

That’s because in the early 2000s, researchers analyzed data from a study called the Women’s Health Initiative and reported that hormone therapy increased the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.288.3.321\">risk of breast cancer, heart disease, blood clots and stroke</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.20.2651\">cognitive decline after menopause</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After this research was first published in 2002, the use of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000143826.38439.af\">hormone therapy fell by 46% within six months</a> – both because clinicians were reluctant to prescribe it and patients were fearful of taking it. In 2003, the FDA added <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-black-box-warning-a-pharmacologist-explains-how-these-labels-protect-patients-269470\">black box warnings</a> – the most serious  warnings, indicating a risk of serious harm or death – to all estrogen-containing hormone products for menopause.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rtxnj-0nqVs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The FDA announced on Nov. 10, 2025, that it will ask drug companies to remove ‘black box’ warnings from hormone therapy for menopause.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But researchers soon <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.010\">pointed out methodological flaws</a> in the analysis. And over the past two decades, careful reanalyses of data from that study, as well as newer studies, have shown that systemic hormone therapy <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005553\">is very safe for most women</a>, though there are nuances surrounding its use.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, women’s health experts have been increasingly vocal in the past five years in <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinicians-call-easing-fda-warnings-low-dose-estrogen-2024a100093t\">calling to remove the black box warnings</a> from a form of hormone menopause therapy that’s applied locally, not systemically. <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19770-estradiol-vaginal-cream\">Topical localized estrogen</a> is applied directly to the vagina and surrounding areas, usually in the form of a cream or vaginal insert. It’s used to treat <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7586\">the genitourinary syndrome of menopause</a>, which manifests as genital and urinary symptoms. </p>\n\n<p>Even though <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.41743\">topical estrogen products are extremely safe</a> and were not evaluated in the Women’s Health Initiative study, the FDA warnings were added to them, too. </p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025\">the FDA held an expert panel</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005553\">what’s currently known</a> about the risks and benefits of  hormone therapy for menopause. At the meeting, most experts urged the agency to remove the warning labels on topical vaginal estrogen products. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604283/fda-menopause-hormone-therapy\">Nov. 10 announcement</a> was the outcome of that discussion, and it included both systemic and topical hormone therapy. </p>\n\n<h2>Why is systemic estrogen no longer considered unsafe?</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers are now finding that the balance of risks and benefits of systemic hormone therapy for menopause seems to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2016.01.004\">depend strongly on when someone starts hormones</a>, as well as the type, dose and length of use.  </p>\n\n<p>For women under 60 or within 10 years of their final period, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/menopause-treatments-can-help-with-hot-flashes-and-other-symptoms-but-many-people-arent-aware-of-the-latest-advances-230376\">the therapy is much safer</a> than it is for older women. A 2017 follow-up of Women’s Health Initiative participants showed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.11217\">overall deaths from any causes actually decreased</a> in this younger cohort of menopausal women taking hormones.  </p>\n\n<p>For women who are more than 10 years from their final menstrual period, starting hormone therapy may <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.4510\">increase their risk of cardiovascular disease</a>. Researchers now refer to this as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/menopause-start-estrogen-replacement-therapy-sooner-to-reduce-heart-disease-116890\">the timing hypothesis</a>. Newer studies <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1505241\">also support this idea</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Also, some ways of delivering hormones to the body turned out to be safer than others. Taking estrogen orally, as pills or tablets, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.642280\">carries a higher risk of blood clots</a>. Those risks go away when it’s delivered through the skin using a patch, gel or spray. Many more options for hormone therapy exist today than in the early 2000s.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it’s well established that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001831\">hormone therapy improves bone health</a> by preventing bone loss. Some studies suggest that in younger menopausal women, it may actually <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hormone-therapy-may-cut-cardiovascular-risk-in-younger-menopausal-women-243561\">protect against cardiovascular disease</a>, though this link is not yet proven and needs more study.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many people missed out on the timing window. In my practice, I see patients who went through menopause 10 or 15 years ago and either didn’t get hormone therapy at the time or stopped taking it when the initial Women’s Health Initiative results came out. Now, they are hearing about the benefits, and many want to try it. But their higher cardiovascular risk may overshadow the benefit.</p>\n\n<h2>What about topical estrogen?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001609\">Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is ubiquitous</a> – it affects every person with ovaries who goes through menopause, and the symptoms tend to worsen with age.</p>\n\n<p>They include vaginal dryness, painful sex and urinary issues such as an increase in urgency or frequency, along with incontinence. Urinary tract infections often tend to get <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/utis-after-menopause-why-theyre-common-and-what-to-do-about-them\">more frequent with menopause</a>, particularly in older women. Treating them can require multiple courses of antibiotics.</p>\n\n<p>Tissues in the genitourinary area are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1888320/\">loaded with estrogen receptors</a> – proteins in cells that bind the hormone. So adding some estrogen back to these areas can help restore the quality and thickness of these tissues, and possibly even promote the growth of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.08.006\">healthy bacteria around the vagina</a> and the urinary tract. The treatment can greatly improve quality of life and promote better health and longevity.</p>\n\n<p>Despite topical estrogen’s safety and effectiveness, the FDA did not distinguish between it and systemic estrogen when adding the black box warnings in 2003. For this reason, many providers whose patients have symptoms relating to the genitourinary syndrome of menopause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2025.103129\">have been reluctant to prescribe it</a>. Often, providers simply don’t know that it has a different safety profile than systemic estrogen.</p>\n\n<h2>How will removing the black box warnings affect patients?</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I see this as a big win for women and their ability to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002028\">manage the symptoms of menopause</a>. I think this will make clinicians and patients far less anxious about prescribing and taking this medication.</p>\n\n<p>Clinicians like me who specialize in women’s health and menopause – and who have been following the research – have been safely prescribing hormone therapy all along. But many general practitioners who often lacked either menopause-specific training or the time and resources to stay on top of the latest findings have been more reluctant to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Safety concerns that led to the black box warnings, especially in regard to local vaginal estrogen, have turned out to be overblown. While clinicians still need to consider who is a good candidate for systemic hormone use, the evidence shows that for most people, it is a safe option. </p>\n\n<p>Even more important, patients who were previously convinced that hormone therapy was unsafe may feel more comfortable discussing it with their provider and considering it. And if they do receive a prescription for hormone therapy, I hope that the likelihood of them starting this effective treatment is no longer <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-025-06246-3\">hindered by reading a scary package insert</a> that was based on outdated evidence. </p>\n\n<p>While this medication is not a silver bullet that reverses aging, starting hormones at the right time can safely improve symptoms that diminish people’s quality of life. So if you’re having symptoms that are bothersome, consider asking your provider about menopause hormone therapy to help manage them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269773/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Genevieve Hofmann has participated in advisory boards with Astellis Pharma and Mayne Pharma.

Hackman had been living with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9164-alzheimers-disease\">Alzheimer’s</a> and depended on Arakawa as his full-time caregiver.</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly, postmortem data suggests that Arakawa died of complications from <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351838\">pulmonary Hantavirus</a> several days before her husband passed. The discordant times of death point to a grim scenario: Hackman was left alone and helpless, trapped in his home after his wife’s death.</p>\n\n<p>The couple’s story, while shocking, is not unique. It serves as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.7404\">a warning for our rapidly aging society</a>. The U.S. population <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/population/older-aging.html\">is aging</a>, but most Americans are <a href=\"https://www.johnhancock.com/ideas-insights/longevity-preparedness-index.html\">not adequately planning to meet the needs of older adulthood</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://experts.umich.edu/6511-kahli-zietlow\">geriatric physician and medical educator</a>, I care for older adults in both inpatient and outpatient settings. My research and clinical work focus on dementia and surrogate decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, regardless of race, education or socioeconomic status, there are some universal challenges that all people face with aging and there are steps everyone can take to prepare.</p>\n\n<h2>Aging is inevitable but unpredictable</h2>\n\n<p>Aging is an unpredictable, highly individualized process that varies depending on a person’s genetics, medical history, cognitive status and socioeconomic factors.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of older Americans report <a href=\"https://ihpi.umich.edu/news-events/news/most-older-adults-say-theyve-experienced-ageism-majority-still-hold-positive\">a strong sense of purpose and self-worth</a>. Many maintain a <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/why-so-many-older-americans-rate-their-health-as-good-or-even-excellent/\">positive view of their overall health</a> well into their 70s and 80s.</p>\n\n<p>But at some point, the body starts to slow down. Older adults experience gradual sensory impairment, loss of muscle mass and <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/03/memory-age-dementia-healthy-brain.html\">changes in their memory</a>. <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/most-common-chronic-health-conditions.html\">Chronic diseases</a> are more likely with advancing age.</p>\n\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table?q=disability\">46% of adults over age 75</a> live with at least one physical disability, and this proportion grows with age. Even those without major health issues may find that routine tasks like yard work, housekeeping and home repairs become insurmountable as they enter their 80s and 90s.</p>\n\n<p>Some may find that subtle changes in memory make it difficult to manage household finances or keep track of their medications. Others may find that vision loss and slowed reaction time make it harder to safely drive. Still others may struggle with basic activities needed to live independently, such as bathing or using a toilet. All of these changes threaten older adults’ ability to remain independent.</p>\n\n<h2>The costs of aging</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/what-lifetime-risk-needing-receiving-long-term-services-supports\">Nearly 70% of older Americans</a> will require long-term care in their lifetime, whether through paid, in-home help or residence in an assisted living facility or nursing home.</p>\n\n<p>But long-term care is expensive. In 2021, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program <a href=\"https://www.ltcfeds.gov/long-term-care/costs\">reported that the average hourly rate</a> for in-home care was US$27. An assisted living apartment averaged $4,800 per month, and a nursing home bed cost nearly double that, at a rate of $276 per day.</p>\n\n<p>Many Americans may be shocked to discover that these costs are not covered by Medicare or other traditional medical insurance. Long-term care insurance covers the cost of long-term care, such as in-home care or nursing home placement. However, what is covered varies from plan to plan. Currently, only a small minority of Americans have long-term care insurance due to <a href=\"https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-much-does-long-term-care-insurance-cost-and-is-it-worth-it/\">high premiums and complex activation rules</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am not aware of any high-quality, peer-reviewed studies that have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of long-term care insurance. Yet, for many Americans, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/the-affordability-of-long-term-care-and-support-services/\">paying for care out of pocket is simply not an option</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/long-term-services-supports\">Medicaid can provide</a> financial support for long-term care but only for older adults <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/what-is-the-difference-between-medicare-medicaid/index.html\">with very low income and minimal assets</a> – criteria most Americans don’t meet until they have nearly exhausted their savings. </p>\n\n<p>Those receiving Medicaid to cover the costs of long-term care have essentially no funds for anything other than medical care, room and board. And proposed federal financial cuts <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/one-big-beautiful-bill-nursing-homes/\">may further erode the limited support services available</a>. In Michigan, for example, <a href=\"https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/personal-needs-allowance/\">Medicaid-covered nursing home residents</a> keep only $60 per month for personal needs. If individuals receive monthly income greater than $60 – for instance, from Social Security or a pension – the extra money would go toward the cost of nursing home care.</p>\n\n<p>Those who don’t qualify for Medicaid or cannot afford private care often rely on family and friends for unpaid assistance, but not everyone has such support systems.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A nurse helps an older man shave.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701091/original/file-20251107-56-qmeh14.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Older adults may end up needing help with day-to-day personal care.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/healthcare-worker-assisting-senior-man-in-shaving-royalty-free-image/1343269576?phrase=eldercare&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Planning for the care you want</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond financial planning, older adults can make an <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/advance-care-planning/advance-care-planning-advance-directives-health-care\">advance directive</a>. This is a set of legal documents that outlines preferences for medical care and asset management if a person becomes incapacitated. However, <a href=\"https://ihpi.umich.edu/news-events/news/older-michiganders-need-more-help-planning-long-term-care-needs-poll-shows\">only about 25% of Americans over 50</a> have completed such documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Without medical and financial powers of attorney in place, state laws determine who makes critical decisions, which may or may not align with a person’s wishes. For instance, an estranged child may have more legal authority over an incapacitated parent than their long-term but unmarried partner. Seniors without clear advocates risk being placed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17797\">under court-appointed guardianship</a> – a restrictive and often irreversible process.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to completing advance directives, it is important that older adults talk about their wishes with their loved ones. Conversations about disability, serious illness and loss of independence can be difficult, but these discussions allow your loved ones to advocate for you in the event of a health crisis.</p>\n\n<h2>Who’s going to care for you?</h2>\n\n<p>Finding a caregiver is an important step in making arrangements for aging. If you are planning to rely on family or friends for some care, it helps to discuss this with them ahead of time and to have contingency plans in place. As the Hackman case demonstrates, if a caregiver is suddenly incapacitated, the older adult may be left in immediate danger.</p>\n\n<p>Caregivers experience higher rates of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2053833\">stress, depression and physical illness</a> compared with their peers. This is often exacerbated by financial strain and a lack of support. It helps if the people you will be relying on have expectations in place about their role.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, some people may prefer placement in a facility rather than relying on a loved one if they can no longer use the bathroom independently. Others may wish to remain in their homes as long as this is a feasible option.</p>\n\n<h2>Connecting with available resources</h2>\n\n<p>There are local and federal initiatives designed to help aging adults find and get the help they need. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recently launched the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/guide\">GUIDE Model</a> to improve care and quality of life for both those suffering from dementia and their caregivers. </p>\n\n<p>This program connects caregivers with local resources and provides a 24-hour support line for crises. While GUIDE, which stands for Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience, is currently in the pilot stage, <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/medicare-guide-program-for-dementia-caregivers/\">it is slowly expanding</a>, and I am hopeful that it will eventually expand to provide enhanced coverage for those suffering from dementia nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npaonline.org/what-is-pace-care\">Program for All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly</a> helps dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid recipients remain at home as they age. This program provides comprehensive services including medical care, a <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/home-care/adult-day-care/\">day center</a> and home health services.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eldercare.acl.gov/home\">Area agencies on aging</a> are regionally located and can connect older adults with local resources, based on availability and income, such as meals, transportation and home modifications that help maintain independence.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, all of these programs and others that support older adults are threatened by recent federal budget cuts. The tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which was signed into law in July 2025, will result in <a href=\"https://www.maynardnexsen.com/publication-nursing-homes-feeling-mixed-effects-after-one-big-beautiful-bill-enacted\">progressive reductions to Medicaid funding over the next 10 years</a>. These cuts will decrease the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid and negatively affect how nursing homes are reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p>The government funding bill passed on Nov. 13 <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-signs-government-funding-bill-ending-record-43-day-shutdown\">extends current Medicare funding</a> through Jan. 30, 2026, at which point <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/9-major-medicare-changes-for-2026-whats-coming-for-premiums-drug-prices-and-program-cuts-11831673\">Medicare funding may be reduced</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even as the future of these programs remains uncertain, it’s important for older adults and their caregivers to be intentional in making plans and to familiarize themselves with the resources available to them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259237/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kahli Zietlow receives funding from Health Resources and Services Administration via grant 1 K01HP49055‐01‐00</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>’Tis the season for giving – and that means ’tis the season for shopping. Maybe you’ll splurge on a Black Friday or Cyber Monday deal, thinking, “I’ll just return it if they don’t like it.” But before you click “buy,” it’s worth knowing that many retailers have quietly tightened their return policies in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/about/our-leaders-and-scholars/faculty-and-academic-divisions/faculty-profiles/lauren-beitelspacher.php\">marketing professor</a>, I study how retailers manage the flood of returns that follow big shopping events like these, and what it reveals about the hidden costs of convenience. Returns might seem like a routine part of doing business, but they’re anything but trivial. According to the National Retail Federation, returns cost U.S. retailers <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/consumers-expected-to-return-nearly-850-billion-in-merchandise-in-2025\">almost US$890 billion each year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Part of that staggering figure comes from returns fraud, which includes everything from consumers buying and wearing items once before returning them – <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/wardrobing-retail-fraud-soars-in-the-summer.html\">a practice known as “wardrobing</a>” – to more deceptive acts such as falsely claiming an item never arrived. </p>\n\n<p>Returns also drain resources because they require <a href=\"https://www.ascm.org/topics/reverse-logistics/\">reverse logistics</a>: shipping, inspecting, restocking and often repackaging items. Many returned products can’t be resold at full price or must be liquidated, leading to lost revenue. Processing returns also adds labor and operational expenses that erode profit margins.</p>\n\n<h2>How e-commerce transformed returns</h2>\n\n<p>While retailers have offered return options <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/return-policy-retail/422145/\">for decades</a>, their use has expanded dramatically in recent years, reflecting how much shopping habits have changed. Before the rise of e-commerce, shopping was a sensory experience: Consumers would touch fabrics, try on clothing and see colors in natural light before buying. If something didn’t work out, customers brought it back to the store, where an associate could quickly inspect and restock it.</p>\n\n<p>Online shopping changed all that. While e-commerce offers convenience and variety, it removes key sensory cues. You can’t feel the material, test the fit or see the true color. The result is uncertainty, and with uncertainty comes higher rates of returns. One analysis by Capital One suggests that the rate for returns is <a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/average-retail-return-rate/\">almost three times higher</a> for online purchases than for in-store purchases.</p>\n\n<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the move toward online shopping <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html\">went into overdrive</a>. Even hesitant online shoppers had to adapt. To encourage purchases, many retailers introduced or expanded generous return policies. The strategy worked to boost sales, but it also created a culture of returning.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, returns accounted for <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/428-billion-merchandise-returned-2020\">10.6% of total U.S. retail sales</a>, nearly double the prior year, according to the National Retail Federation data. By 2021, that had <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/25/retailers-average-return-rate-jumps-to-16point6percent-as-online-sales-grow-.html\">climbed to 16.6%</a>. Unable to try things on in stores, consumers began ordering multiple sizes or styles, keeping one and sending the rest back. The behavior was rational from a shopper’s perspective but devastatingly expensive for retailers. </p>\n\n<h2>The high cost of convenience</h2>\n\n<p>Most supply chains are designed to move in one direction: from production to consumption. Returns reverse that flow. When merchandise moves backward, it adds layers of cost and complexity.</p>\n\n<p>In-store returns used to be simple: A customer would take an item back to the store, the retailer would inspect the product, and, if it was in good condition, it would go right back on the shelf. Online returns, however, are far more cumbersome. Products can spend weeks in transit and often can’t be resold – by the time they arrive, they may be out of season, obsolete or no longer in their original packaging.</p>\n\n<p>Logistics costs compound the problem. During the pandemic, consumers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.02.020\">grew accustomed to free shipping</a>. That means retailers now often pay twice: once to deliver the item and again to retrieve it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in a post-pandemic world, retailers are trying to strike a balance – maintaining customer goodwill without sacrificing profitability. One solution is to raise prices, but especially today, with inflation in the headlines, shoppers are sensitive to price hikes. The other, more common approach is to tighten return policies.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, that’s taken several forms. Some retailers have begun charging small flat fees for returns, even when a customer mails an item back at their own expense. For example, the direct-to-consumer retailer Curvy Sense offers customers unlimited returns and exchanges of an item <a href=\"https://curvysense.com/products/free-unlimited-returns-exchanges?srsltid=AfmBOopwIGPsdaTEhpdXGoaMZQ0KbRGTGBXNB40Tso_34sYNV1VXTNuW\">for an initial $2.98 price</a>. Others have shortened their return windows. Over the summer, for example, beauty retailers Sephora and Ulta reduced their return window <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/retail/sephora-and-ulta-beauty-quietly-changed-their-return-polices\">from 60 days to 30</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Many brands now attach large, conspicuous “do not remove” tags to prevent consumers from wearing items and then sending them back. And increasingly, retailers are offering store credit rather than cash or credit card refunds, ensuring that returned sales at least stay within their company.</p>\n\n<p>Few retailers advertise these changes prominently. Instead, they appear quietly in the fine print of return policies – policies that are now longer, more specific and far less forgiving than they once were.</p>\n\n<p>As we head into the busiest shopping season of the year, it’s worth pausing before you click “purchase.” Ask yourself: Is this something I truly want – or am I planning to return it later?</p>\n\n<p>Whenever possible, shop in person and return in person. And if you’re buying online, make sure you familiarize yourself with the return policy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266975/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lauren Beitelspacher does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Typically laden with delicious foods, it’s not uncommon to eat more during the holidays than you usually would.  </p>\n\n<p>You likely know that feeling of being too stuffed – the point when you’re pleasantly satisfied one moment and uncomfortably full the next. On top of that physical discomfort can come extra helpings of guilt for eating more than you wanted or expected.   </p>\n\n<p>The physical and psychological pressure of holiday meals can be challenging. <a href=\"https://miamioh.edu/profiles/ehs/bryn-beeder.html\">As a registered dietitian</a>, I want to assure you that your body <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works\">knows what to do with that extra food and drink</a>, and that your overall health and well-being are defined by much more than a few days of indulgence.

The larger quantity of food will require a bit <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/frym.2024.1386116\">more time to digest</a>, meaning it will move more slowly along your GI tract. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594226/\">Protein and fats</a> also naturally take longer to break down. While more carbohydrate-rich foods, such as a granola bar or a glass of orange juice, give you a quick burst of energy, adding more protein- and fat-rich foods, such as eggs or chicken, to your meal provides energy that lasts longer.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the slower digestive process can actually be beneficial for steady energy and appetite control. </p>\n\n<h2>Physical discomfort</h2>\n\n<p>Rest assured, your <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works#whathappens\">digestive system</a> will carry on no matter how big the meal. Rather, the question is how long digestion will take and whether that may cause some temporary discomfort along the way. </p>\n\n<p>When you eat, your stomach stretches to accommodate the food you consumed. As the stomach works to pass food contents into the small intestine, there is an <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9617-heartburn-overview\">increased chance of heartburn</a> – a backflow of acidic stomach contents that can cause a burning sensation in your chest or sour taste in your mouth. Extra food can also lead to stomach pain, nausea, gas and bloating, as well as a general sluggish feeling.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Person gripping stomach, stacked plates of mostly eaten food before them\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702067/original/file-20251112-56-igf1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Digesting a large meal can be uncomfortable.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-with-bloating-and-stomach-pain-after-eating-royalty-free-image/2219960906\">seb_ra/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Even before the first bite, your body begins preparing for digestion. The <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system\">first sight and smell of food</a> increases your body’s production of saliva and stomach acid in anticipation of the work ahead. </p>\n\n<p>When the workload is greater than usual, your body temporarily <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218769/\">expends more energy to fuel the digestive process</a>, both in breaking down macronutrients and in absorbing that fuel for use later. As a result, it is typical to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tired-after-eating\">feel more tired after a large meal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the physical discomfort of digestion, try <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223\">staying upright</a> after a meal. While lying down may be tempting, it can increase stomach pain and the risk of heartburn. Give your body time and let gravity work in your favor by staying upright for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001538\">at least two to three hours</a> after eating. A <a href=\"https://www.prevention.com/health/a64818569/does-walking-help-digestion/\">10- to 15-minute walk</a> can also be beneficial to the digestive process, increasing stomach contractions and overall blood flow to the GI tract. This can in turn move food out of the stomach and into the small intestine more efficiently. </p>\n\n<h2>Moving past food guilt</h2>\n\n<p>One day of indulgence alone will not cause permanent weight gain or lasting changes to your physical health. But repeated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100221\">patterns of food guilt</a> can, over time, lead to an unhealthy relationship to food.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond digestion, the way you think and talk about food can be just as important as how you feel after eating. <a href=\"https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/removing-food-morality/\">Food does not have moral value</a>, and yet it is easy to become caught in the habit of labeling foods as “good” or “bad.” This mindset often shows up during the holidays. Think about how often you hear yourself or others say, “I was good all morning so I can eat more tonight” or “I’m going to be bad and have the pie, too.” How you speak about food directly shapes how you feel about eating it and about yourself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three people sitting at a table eating and smiling at a dog asking for a bite\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=411&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702065/original/file-20251112-56-wyzdae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=517&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Food nourishes your body and your relationships.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-looks-amused-as-a-friend-gives-in-and-gives-a-royalty-free-image/1391487579\">Catherine Falls Commercial/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Food can also bring <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tastes-from-our-past-can-spark-memories-trigger-pain-or-boost-wellbeing-heres-how-to-embrace-food-nostalgia-232826\">positive emotions and good memories</a>.

But focusing on cheating overlooks a larger set of ethical concerns that higher education institutions face, from the use of copyrighted material in large language models to student privacy.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://magazine.holycross.edu/stories/ai-course-delivers-few-answers-many-questions-and-even-more-discussion\">a sociologist who teaches about AI</a> and studies the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-us-really-is-unlike-other-rich-countries-when-it-comes-to-job-insecurity-and-ai-could-make-it-even-more-exceptional-261934\">impact of this technology on work</a>, I am well acquainted with research on the rise of AI and its social consequences. And when one looks at ethical questions from multiple perspectives – those of students, higher education institutions and technology companies – it is clear that the burden of responsible AI use should not fall entirely on students’ shoulders. </p>\n\n<p>I argue that responsibility, more generally, begins with the companies behind this technology and needs to be shouldered by higher education institutions themselves.</p>\n\n<h2>To ban or not to ban generative AI</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s start where some <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/09/17/how-college-ai-use-shifted-from-campuswide-bans-to-big-techs-playbook/\">colleges and universities did</a>: banning generative AI products, such as ChatGPT, partly over student academic integrity concerns. </p>\n\n<p>While there is evidence that <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai.html\">students inappropriately use this technology</a>, banning generative AI ignores research indicating <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07356331241277937\">it can improve college students’ academic achievement</a>. Studies have also shown generative AI may have <a href=\"https://contexts.org/blog/working-for-ai/\">other educational benefits</a>, such as for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2023.2244935\">students with disabilities</a>. Furthermore, higher education institutions have a responsibility to <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/ai-life-skills-colleges-workers/709640/\">make students ready for AI-infused workplaces</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Given generative AI’s benefits and its widespread student use, many colleges and universities today <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882125000052\">have integrated generative AI into their curricula</a>. Some higher education institutions have even provided students free access to these tools through their school accounts. Yet I believe these strategies involve additional ethical considerations and risks. </p>\n\n<p>As with previous waves of technology, the adoption of generative AI can exacerbate inequalities in education, given that not all <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-ai-keep-students-motivated-or-does-it-do-the-opposite-264728\">students will have access to the same technology</a>. If schools encourage generative AI use without providing students with free access, there will be a divide between students who can pay for a subscription and those who use free tools. </p>\n\n<p>On top of this, students using free tools <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-tools-collect-and-store-data-about-you-from-all-your-devices-heres-how-to-be-aware-of-what-youre-revealing-251693\">have few privacy guarantees in the U.S.</a> When they use these tools – even as simple as “Hey ChatGPT, can you help me brainstorm a paper idea?” – students are producing potentially <a href=\"https://contexts.org/blog/working-for-ai/\">valuable data that companies use to improve their models</a>. By contrast, paid versions can offer more data protections and clearer privacy guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Higher education institutions can address equity concerns and help protect student data by seeking licenses with vendors that address student privacy. These licenses can provide students with free access to generative AI tools and specify that student data is not to be used to train or improve models. However, they are not panaceas.</p>\n\n<h2>Who’s responsible now?</h2>\n\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/54122/teaching-ai\">Teaching with AI</a>,” José Antonio Bowen and C. Edward Watson argue that higher education institutions need to rethink their approach to academic integrity. I agree with their assessment, but for ethical reasons not covered in their book: Integrating generative AI into the curriculum through vendor agreements involves higher education institutions recognizing tech companies’ transgressions and carefully considering the implications of owning student data.  </p>\n\n<p>To begin, I find the practice of penalizing students for “stealing” words from large language models to write papers ethically difficult to reconcile with tech companies’ automated “scraping” of websites, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922\">such as Wikipedia and Reddit</a>, without citation. Big tech companies have used copyrighted material – some of it <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/08/30/claude-now-joins-openai-in-getting-sued-for-copyright-infringement/\">allegedly taken from piracy websites</a> – to train the large language models that power chatbots. Although the two actions – asking a chatbot to write an essay versus training it on copyrighted material – are not exactly the same, they both have a component of ethical responsibility. For technology companies, ethical issues such as this are <a href=\"https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063\">typically raised only in lawsuits</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For institutions of higher education, I think these issues should be raised prior to signing AI vendor licenses. As <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/sometimes-we-resist-ai-for-good-reasons\">a Chronicle of Higher Education article suggests</a>, colleges and universities should vet AI model outputs as they would student papers. If they have not done so prior to signing vendor agreements, I see little basis for them to pursue traditional “academic integrity” violations for alleged student plagiarism. Instead, higher education institutions should consider changes to their academic integrity policies. </p>\n\n<p>Then there is the issue of how student data is handled under AI vendor agreements. One likely source of student concern is whether their school, as a commercial customer and data owner, logs interactions with identifiers and can pursue academic integrity charges and other matters on this basis. </p>\n\n<p>The solution to this is simple: Higher education institutions can prominently display the terms and conditions of such agreements to members of their community. If colleges and universities are unwilling to do so, or if their leaders don’t understand the terms themselves, then maybe institutions need to rethink their AI strategies.   </p>\n\n<p>The above data privacy issues take on new meaning given the ways in which generative AI is currently being used, sometimes as “companions” with which people share highly personal information. OpenAI estimates that about <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/\">70% of ChatGPT consumer usage is for nonwork purposes</a>. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, recognizes that people are turning to ChatGPT for “<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">deeply personal decisions that include life advice, coaching and support</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Although the long-term effects of using chatbots as companions or confidants is unknown, the recent case of a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545749/ai-chatbots-safety-openai-meta-characterai-teens-suicide\">teen committing suicide while interacting with ChatGPT</a> is a tragic reminder of generative AI’s risks and the importance of ensuring people’s personal security along with their privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Formulating explicit statements that generative AI should be used only for academic purposes could help mitigate the risks related to students forming potentially damaging emotional attachments with chatbots. So, too, could reminders about campus mental health and other resources. Training students and faculty on all these matters and more can aid in promoting personally responsible AI use. </p>\n\n<p>But colleges and universities cannot skirt their own responsibilities. At some point, higher education institutions may see that such responsibility is too heavy of a cross to bear and that their risk-mitigation strategies are essentially Band-Aids for a systemic problem.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268167/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jeffrey C.

Rockenbach</a> and I designed the project in partnership with Interfaith America, a nonprofit that encourages interfaith dialogue on campus. Running from 2015 to 2019, it surveyed 3,486 students across 122 campuses to understand the ways colleges could support students’ well-being when it comes to their worldviews, religious identities and spiritual beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>A main theme emerged in students’ responses: Feeling cared about, accepted and valued on campus was <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IDEALS-2019-Friendships-Matter.pdf\">rooted in relationships</a>. But faculty and staff also had an important role to play in modeling respectful relationships and in helping students engage respectively with each other.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Rows of young people, most of whom are Black, stand and sing in a large darkened auditorium.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701997/original/file-20251112-56-3f576w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jackson State University students worship during the Tigerville Gospel Explosion on April 13, 2025, in Jackson, Miss.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jackson-state-university-students-engage-in-praise-and-news-photo/2210257501?adppopup=true\">Aron Smith/Jackson State University via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Findings from the study also showed that campuses can help foster student <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/016146812112300706\">friendships across religions</a> by creating opportunities for students to engage with each other authentically. They can try to make sure campus conversations about religion and spirituality are built on trust, <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/853532\">not proselytizing or coercion</a>. They can offer opportunities for students from different religious backgrounds to participate in <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ideals-20182.pdf\">service-learning experiences, leadership opportunities and interfaith programs</a>, to name a few. </p>\n\n<p>Respectful relationships are especially important for religious minorities’ sense of belonging. A campus’s climate is often shaped by Christian heritage in ways many students may not even notice: chapels, sometimes repurposed as classroom space; dining halls that don’t offer halal or kosher meals; and academic calendars that prioritize certain religious holidays over others. </p>\n\n<p>Apart from addressing these issues head-on, there are other ways to help offset these dynamics. In the IDEALS study, students who reported having supportive spaces for challenging but respectful dialogues – where they could share perspectives without feeling coerced or harmed – with peers who hold differing worldviews <a href=\"https://www.interfaithamerica.org/research/ideals/\">felt a greater sense of belonging</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The answer is not to avoid tough conversations. Instead, it is to ensure they are guided and productive. In this sense, strong academic engagement matters: involving faculty both in and out of the classroom, as one means of helping students engage with one another respectfully.</p>\n\n<h2>Academic support</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to the IDEALS survey, we had a sense of what matters to students in making their worldview feel respected on campus. But how are campuses actually doing at implementing those practices?</p>\n\n<p>To find out, Rockenbach and I then designed the Institutional Norms Supporting Pluralism and Inclusive Religious Engagement Study, <a href=\"https://www.inspiresindex.org/\">or INSPIRES</a>. This ongoing project is a multiyear exploration into the factors institutions have in place to support the well-being of students with a wide range of beliefs. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young men and women stand in rows outside at night, some of them bent forward in prayer.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702002/original/file-20251112-56-flrhms.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Jewish students and allies hold a Shabbat and a prayer in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian students encampment at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., on April 26, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jewish-students-and-allies-hold-a-shabbat-and-a-davening-news-photo/2149787944?adppopup=true\">Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The sample included data from 318 colleges and universities. Thirty-one percent were public, while 69% were private. Any university can sign up for the assessment, free of cost, so 174 of these schools have participated multiple times to understand how their campus’s climate is changing – whether it’s becoming more welcoming, and for whom. </p>\n\n<p>Our team used student responses to the IDEALS surveys to develop scales, measuring how welcoming campuses are for students from diverse spiritual backgrounds. We then rated schools from 1 to 5 – the highest rating – on several different areas, such as religious accommodations and efforts to combat hate and intolerance. </p>\n\n<p>One of the most important categories is academic engagement – specifically, how institutions formalize practices designed to foster two things. The first is interfaith literacy: <a href=\"https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/what-we-do/our-approach/what-religious-literacy\">knowledge and understanding of diverse religious traditions</a>. The second is dialogue: structured opportunities for interaction among people of different religious, spiritual and secular beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>The data shows that most schools have lots of room for improvement when it comes to academic engagement about religion. Using the 1-5 scale, 19% of institutions scored a 1, and 33% of schools scored just a 2. Another 30% scored a 3. Seventeen percent scored a 4 – and only two out of the 318 received a 5.</p>\n\n<p>More than 52% of institutions are in the lowest two levels, highlighting the lack of campuswide academic initiatives that foster belonging.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A student's light blue cap has 'My success is only by Allah' penned on it in Arabic and English.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702007/original/file-20251112-56-jxclar.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A student wears a graduation cap with a verse from the Quran written on it at Columbia University in New York City on May 21, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/student-wears-a-graduation-cap-with-a-verse-from-koran-news-photo/2215661839?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Jeenah Moon/Pool/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>5-star standard</h2>\n\n<p>The five-star standard includes practices that foster safe, guided interactions among people who hold different worldviews. </p>\n\n<p>In part, that means embedding worldview diversity in the curriculum.

Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jul/91-Percent-of-New-Renewable-Projects-Now-Cheaper-Than-Fossil-Fuels-Alternatives\">less expensive</a> today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. </p>\n\n<p>Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I <a href=\"https://keough.nd.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/jay-gulledge/\">study energy and climate solutions</a> and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation.</p>\n\n<h2>Falling clean energy prices</h2>\n\n<p>As their technologies have matured, solar power and wind power have become <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Jul/Costs-2025_Media-Briefing-Presentation.pdf\">cheaper than coal and natural gas</a> for utility-scale electricity generation in most areas, in large part because the fuel is free. The total global power generation from renewable sources <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Jul/IRENA_TEC_RPGC_in_2024_2025.pdf\">saved US$467 billion</a> in avoided fuel costs in 2024 alone.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of falling prices, <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Mar/Record-Breaking-Annual-Growth-in-Renewable-Power-Capacity\">over 90%</a> of all electricity-generating capacity added worldwide in 2024 came from clean energy sources, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of 2024, renewable energy accounted for <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Mar/IRENA_DAT_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2025.pdf\">46% of global installed electric power capacity</a>, with a record 585 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity added that year — <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/texas/\">about three times the total generating capacity in Texas</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Sv3Cl\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Sv3Cl/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Health benefits of leaving fossil fuels</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond affordability, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is healthier</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Burning coal, oil and natural gas releases tiny particles into the air along with toxic gases; these pollutants can make people sick. A recent study found air pollution from fossil fuels causes an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2023-077784\">5 million deaths worldwide</a> a year, based on 2019 data. </p>\n\n<p>For example, using natural gas to fuel stoves and other appliances <a href=\"https://www.psehealthyenergy.org/work/impacts-of-benzene-indoors-from-gas-stove-combustion/\">releases benzene</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/benzene.html\">known carcinogen</a>. The health risks of this exposure in some homes has been found to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c09289\">comparable to secondhand tobacco smoke</a>. Natural gas combustion has also been linked to childhood asthma, with an estimated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010075\">12.7% of U.S. childhood asthma cases</a> attributable to gas stoves, according to one study.</p>\n\n<p>Fossil fuels are also the leading sources of climate-warming greenhouse gases. When <a href=\"https://ugc.berkeley.edu/background-content/burning-of-fossil-fuels/\">they’re burned</a> to generate electricity or run factories, vehicles and appliances, they release carbon dioxide and other gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat near the Earth’s surface. That accumulation has been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">raising global temperatures and causing more</a> heat stress, respiratory illnesses and the spread of disease.</p>\n\n<p>Electrifying buildings, cars and appliances, and powering them with renewable energy, reduces these air pollutants while slowing climate change.</p>\n\n<h2>So what’s the problem?</h2>\n\n<p>In spite of the demonstrated economic and health benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, regulatory inertia, political gridlock and a lack of investment are holding back renewable energy deployment in much of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, for example, major energy projects take an average of 4.5 years to permit, and approval of new transmission lines <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2024/04/ACP-Pass-Permitting-Reform_Fact-Sheet.pdf\">can take a decade or longer</a>. A large <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-september-2024\">majority of planned new power projects in the U.S. use solar power</a>, and these delays are slowing them down.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4753?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">2024 Energy Permitting Reform Act</a> introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, to speed approvals failed to pass. <a href=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/12/manchin-statement-on-house-republican-leadership-blocking-permitting-reform?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Manchin called it</a> “just another example of politics getting in the way of doing what’s best for the country.” </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"u3fo9\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u3fo9/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>An even bigger challenge faces developing countries <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\">whose economies are growing fast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These countries need to meet soaring energy demand.

These include government payment guarantees, stable fuel contracts and long-term revenue deals that help guarantee the lender will be repaid.</p>\n\n<p>Both lenders and governments have less experience with renewable energy projects. As a result, these projects often come with weaker government guarantees.

      "content": "<p>Not long ago, the idea of getting paid to share your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/broadcasting-your-breakfast-why-tiktokers-obsess-over-morning-routines\">morning routine</a> online would have sounded absurd. Yet today, influencers are big business: The global market is <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/\">expected to surpass US$32 billion</a> by the end of 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Rooted in celebrity culture but driven by digital platforms, the influencer economy represents a powerful force in both commerce and culture. I’m <a href=\"https://charleston.edu/management-marketing/faculty-staff/anderson-kelley.php\">an expert</a> on digital consumer research, and I see the rise of influencers as an important evolution in the relationship between companies, consumers and creators.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, brands leaned on traditional celebrities like musicians, athletes and actors to endorse their products. However, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2478/nimmir-2025-0001\">by the late 2000s</a>, social media platforms opened the door for everyday people to build audiences. Initially, influencers were viewed as a low-cost marketing tactic. Soon, however, they became a central part of marketing strategies. </p>\n\n<p>In the 2010s, influencer marketing matured into a global industry. Agencies and <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketplaces/\">digital marketplaces</a> emerged to professionalize influencer-brand matchmaking, and regulators like the <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-influencers-will-marketers-draw-line/\">Federal Trade Commission</a> started paying more attention to sponsored content. </p>\n\n<p>The rise of video and short-form content like TikTok and Reels in the mid-2010s and 2020s added authenticity and emotional immediacy. These dynamics deepened influencer-follower relations in ways that brands couldn’t easily replicate. Influencers are now recognized as not only <a href=\"https://jocis.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JOCIS_11_Miolo2_52-82.pdf\">content creators</a>, but also as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad003\">entrepreneurs</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cb.2474\">cultural producers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why people trust influencers</h2>\n\n<p>Social media influencers often foster what researchers call “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/taylor-swift-is-engaged-shes-been-getting-her-fans-ready-for-this-moment-for-20-years-264027\">parasocial relationships</a>” – one-sided bonds where followers feel as if they personally know the influencer. While the concept has roots in traditional <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049\">celebrity culture</a>, influencers amplify it through consistent, seemingly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-65727-6_2\">authentic content</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This perceived intimacy helps explain why consumers often <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2024/08/14/how-influencers-can-drive-consumer-purchasing-behavior/\">trust influencers more than brands</a>. Though the parasocial relationship isn’t mutual, it feels real. That emotional closeness cultivates trust, a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/brands-want-us-to-trust-them-but-as-the-spf-debacle-shows-they-need-to-earn-it-259565\">scarce but powerful currency</a> in today’s economy.</p>\n\n<p>The goal for many influencers may be financial independence, but the path begins with <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/09/08/the-influencer-industry-the-quest-for-authenticity-on-social-media/\">social and cultural capital</a>, acquired through community connection, relatability and niche expertise. As an influencer’s following grows, so does their perceived legitimacy. Brands, in turn, recognize and tap into that legitimacy. </p>\n\n<p>Although risks exist, like <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-fitness-influencers-game-the-algorithms-to-pump-up-their-engagement-196017\">algorithmic incentives</a> and commercial partnerships that undercut authenticity, many influencers successfully navigate this tension to preserve their community’s trust. </p>\n\n<h2>The many ways creators add value</h2>\n\n<p>Like any economy, the influencer economy revolves around <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-024-01073-2\">value exchange</a>. Followers spend their valuable resources – time <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2022.2157864\">and attention</a> – in return for something meaningful. Researchers have identified several forms of value that influencers’ content can take:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Connection,</strong> or what researchers call “social value”: Influencers often build tight-knit communities around shared interests. Through live chats, comments and relatable storytelling, they offer a sense of belonging.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Fun,</strong> or “hedonic value”: Many influencers provide enjoyment using entertainment, humor and a touch of allure in their content. Think cat videos, TikTok dances and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02761467231163754\">random acts of kindness</a> that deliver joy and distraction from the day-to-day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge,</strong> or “epistemic value”: Creators offer informational or <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time100-creators-2025/7299150/mark-rober/\">educational content</a> to feed consumer curiosity. This can be through tutorials, product reviews or deep dives into niche topics.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Usefulness,</strong> or “utilitarian value”: From life hacks to product roundups, like “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/viral-amazon-must-haves-for-2025\">Amazon must-haves</a>,” influencers provide utilitarian or practical value to help simplify consumer decisions and solve everyday problems.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Money,</strong> or “financial value”: People love finding a bargain. <a href=\"https://www.influencer-hero.com/top-influencers/top-30-budget-beauty-influencers-in-the-us\">Discounts</a>, affiliate links and deal alerts offer direct economic benefit to followers. Some influencers even <a href=\"https://hireinfluence.com/blog/10-influencer-founded-brands-inspiring/\">launch their own products</a> or digital courses, delivering long-term value through entrepreneurial spinoffs. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These forms of value often overlap, reinforcing trust, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-024-01073-2\">can pay off financially</a> for influencers. In fact, consumers are significantly more likely to <a href=\"https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2024/11/is-user-generated-content-ugc-a-double-edged-sword-for-marketers\">trust user-generated content</a> like influencer posts over brand-generated advertising. </p>\n\n<h2>Lessons for brands</h2>\n\n<p>First, there’s evidence that smaller is often stronger. Marketing researchers categorize influencers based on how many followers they have, and nano- and microinfluencers – defined as those with fewer than 10,000 and 100,000 followers, respectively – <a href=\"https://later.com/blog/influencer-engagement-rate/\">often generate stronger engagement</a> than mega-influencers with more than 1 million. Influencers with smaller followings can interact with their communities more closely, making their endorsements feel more credible.</p>\n\n<p>This has driven brands to focus on <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics\">mid-tier and microinfluencers</a>, where return on investment is often stronger. As a result, influencer agencies, brokers, platforms and trade associations have sprung up to facilitate these partnerships. </p>\n\n<p>Second, brands should remember that influencers’ role in the market comes with new challenges. As the field continues to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\">become more professionalized</a>, it’s also become more complex. Like other entrepreneurs, influencers must keep up with shifting regulations – namely, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/ftc-influencer-guidelines/#:%7E:text=reading%20any%20further.-,FTC%20guidelines%20for%20influencers%20and%20content%20creators,make%20sure%20their%20followers%20know\">FTC sponsorship guidelines</a> – which can lead to hefty fines if violated. Many struggle to identify <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/influencers-have-trouble-figuring-out-their-tax-obligations-and-with-good-reason-250490\">how to best file their taxes</a> when they receive freebies they are expected to build content around. It can also be a challenge for influencers to keep up with <a href=\"https://stackinfluence.com/2025-social-media-algorithm-changes-engagement/\">continued algorithm tweaks</a> from the multiple social media platforms where they publish. </p>\n\n<p>Influencers manage more than content creation. Their role includes quickly responding to followers’ comments and managing communities, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231203682\">handling trolls</a>, all of which is stressful. Personal brand management adds another layer of pressure. As influencers gain more brand partnerships, they run the risk of being seen as “selling out.” Because parasocial trust depends on being viewed as authentic, aligning with the wrong brand or being too promotional can damage the very connection that built an influencer’s following. A single misstep can <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauljankowski/2021/06/22/7-tips-for-brands-when-their-influencers-get-canceled/\">trigger public backlash</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While growing a following can bring brand recognition and financial independence, some influencers even fear that they will <a href=\"https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/items/e59b7daa-0a51-453a-bbd7-c1125e5c1969\">lose their own identity</a>. Influencers can struggle with work-life balance, as this is not a nine-to-five job. It requires being “always on” and the constant <a href=\"https://www.gwi.com/blog/how-influencer-marketing-is-changing\">blurred lines</a>. Their lives become their livelihoods, with little separation between personal and professional identity. </p>\n\n<p>In short, when engaging with influencers, strategic brands will recognize that they operate within an intense, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/05/why-the-influencer-industry-needs-guardrails\">high-pressure environment</a>. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.americaninfluencercouncil.com\">American Influencer Council</a> offer support and advocacy, but industry-wide protections are lacking.</p>\n\n<p>Influencers have earned a central place in consumer culture not just by selling products, but by offering emotional proximity, cultural relevance and value. They’re not just marketers – they’re creators, community leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>As the creator economy continues to grow, trust will remain its cornerstone. However, the next chapter will require thoughtful navigation of issues like regulation, platform ethics and creator well-being. Understanding influencers means recognizing both their creative work and the evolving market that now depends on them.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265718/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kelley Cours Anderson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Some also believe that because we are different from other creatures, we have complete control over our destiny and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/are-we-still-evolving-what-human-evolution-looks-like-today#google_vignette\">have no need to evolve</a>. Even though lots of people believe this, it’s not true. </p>\n\n<p>Like other living creatures, humans have been shaped by evolution. Over time, we have developed – and continue to develop – the traits that help us survive and flourish in the environments where we live. </p>\n\n<p>I’m an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=3oKUNQ0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">anthropologist</a>. I study how humans adapt to different environments. <a href=\"https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/mechanisms-the-processes-of-evolution/adaptation/\">Adaptation</a> is an important part of evolution. Adaptations are traits that give someone an advantage in their environment. People with those traits are more likely to survive and pass those traits on to their children. Over many generations, those traits become widespread in the population.</p>\n\n<h2>The role of culture</h2>\n\n<p>We humans have two hands that help us skillfully use tools and other objects. We are able to walk and run on two legs, which frees our hands for these skilled tasks. And we have large brains that let us <a href=\"https://askananthropologist.asu.edu/stories/when-did-our-brains-get-big\">reason, create ideas and live successfully with other people</a> in social groups. </p>\n\n<p>All of these traits have helped humans develop culture. Culture includes all of our ideas and beliefs and our abilities to plan and think about the present and the future. It also includes our ability to change our environment, for example by making tools and growing food. </p>\n\n<p>Although we humans have changed our environment in many ways during the past few thousand years, we are still changed by evolution. We have not stopped evolving, but we are evolving right now in different ways than our ancient ancestors. Our environments are <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/science/are-humans-still-evolving/\">often changed by our culture</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We usually think of an environment as the weather, plants and animals in a place. But environments include the foods we eat and the infectious diseases we are exposed to. </p>\n\n<p>A very important part of the environment is the climate and what kinds of conditions we can live in. Our culture helps us change our exposure to the climate. For example, we build houses and put furnaces and air conditioners in them. But culture doesn’t fully protect us from extremes of heat, cold and the sun’s rays. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a man runs after one of several goats in a dry, dusty landscape\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=427&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702343/original/file-20251113-56-ha881v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=536&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Turkana people in Kenya have evolved to survive with less water than other people, which helps them live in a desert environment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/turkana-herder-rounds-up-his-goats-near-lokitaung-in-news-photo/664658328\">Tony Karumba/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of how humans have evolved over the past 10,000 years and how we are continuing to evolve today.</p>\n\n<h2>The power of the sun’s rays</h2>\n\n<p>While the sun’s rays are important for life on our planet, ultraviolet rays <a href=\"https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/ultraviolet-radiation/277493\">can damage human skin</a>. Those of us with pale skin are in danger of serious sunburn and equally dangerous kinds of skin cancer. In contrast, those of us with a lot of skin pigment, called melanin, have some <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22615-melanin\">protection against damaging ultraviolet rays</a> from sunshine.</p>\n\n<p>People in the tropics with dark skin are <a href=\"https://online.kidsdiscover.com/unit/skin/topic/the-colors-of-skin\">more likely to thrive</a> under frequent bright sunlight. Yet, when ancient humans moved to cloudy, cooler places, the dark skin was not needed. Dark skin in cloudy places blocked the production of vitamin D in the skin, which is necessary for normal bone growth in children and adults. </p>\n\n<p>The amount of melanin pigment in our skin is <a href=\"https://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/jablonski-lab/evolution-of-human-skin-and-skin-pigmentation/\">controlled by our genes</a>. So in this way, human evolution is driven by the environment – sunny or cloudy – in different parts of the world.</p>\n\n<h2>The food that we eat</h2>\n\n<p>Ten thousand years ago, our human ancestors began to tame or <a href=\"https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/domesticated-animal/272875\">domesticate animals</a> such as cattle and goats to eat their meat. Then about 2,000 years later, they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20682-3\">learned how to milk cows and goats</a> for this rich food. Unfortunately, like most other mammals at that time, human adults back then could not digest milk without feeling ill. Yet a few people were able to digest milk because they had genes that let them do so. </p>\n\n<p>Milk was such an important source of food in these societies that the people who could digest milk were <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-humans-ability-to-digest-milk-evolved-from-famine-and-disease/\">better able to survive</a> and have many children. So the genes that allowed them to digest milk increased in the population until nearly everyone could drink milk as adults. </p>\n\n<p>This process, which occurred and spread thousands of years ago, is an example of what is called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2025.08.003\">cultural and biological co-evolution</a>. It was the cultural practice of milking animals that <a href=\"https://www.snexplores.org/article/got-milk-how\">led to these genetic or biological changes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Other people, such as the Inuit in Greenland, have genes that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/17/441169188/the-secret-to-the-inuit-high-fat-diet-may-be-good-genes\">enable them to digest fats</a> without suffering from heart diseases. The Turkana people herd livestock in Kenya in a very dry part of Africa. They have a gene that allows them to go for long periods <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2467\">without drinking much water</a>. This practice would cause kidney damage in other people because the kidney regulates water in your body. </p>\n\n<p>These examples show how the remarkable diversity of foods that people eat around the world can affect evolution.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"gray scale microscope image of numerous blobs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=465&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702344/original/file-20251113-56-lidj1x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=584&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">These bacteria caused a devastating pandemic nearly 700 years ago that led humans to evolve resistance to them.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/scanning-electron-micrograph-depicting-a-mass-of-yersinia-news-photo/1289424977\">Image Point FR/NIH/NIAID/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Diseases that threaten us</h2>\n\n<p>Like all living creatures, humans have been exposed to many infectious diseases. During the 14th century a deadly disease called the <a href=\"https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/plague/353636\">bubonic plague</a> struck and spread rapidly throughout Europe and Asia. It <a href=\"https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/the-plague-that-shook-medieval-europe\">killed about one-third of the population</a> in Europe. Many of those who survived had a specific gene that gave them resistance against the disease. Those people and their descendants were <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-black-death-shaped-human-evolution\">better able to survive</a> epidemics that followed for several centuries. </p>\n\n<p>Some diseases have struck quite recently. COVID-19, for instance, swept the globe in 2020. Vaccinations saved many lives. Some people have a <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2023/06/425696/gene-mutation-may-explain-why-some-dont-get-sick-covid-19\">natural resistance to the virus</a> based on their genes. It may be that evolution increases this resistance in the population and helps humans fight future virus epidemics. </p>\n\n<p>As human beings, we are exposed to a variety of changing environments. And so evolution in many human populations continues across generations, including right now.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you’d like an expert to answer?

It has claimed countless lives, deepened social divisions and even led to the collapse of democratic systems. </p>\n\n<p>In recent history, political violence and its deadly consequences were seen in <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen\">Italy after World War I</a> when thousands of fascist supporters marched on Rome, the capital, threatening to overthrow the government unless Benito Mussolini was appointed prime minister. That kind of violence and its effects were also seen in <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250210869/thedeathofdemocracy/\">1930s Germany</a>, where Adolf Hitler suppressed opposition and suspended civil liberties amid widespread unrest and factional violence. </p>\n\n<p>Similar patterns occurred elsewhere in the decades that followed. Fascist movements used political violence and intimidation to seize or consolidate power, as seen in <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/spanish-civil-war\">Spain under Francisco Franco</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309021027_The_Political_and_Ideological_Origins_of_the_Estado_Novo_in_Portugal\">Portugal under António de Oliveira Salazar</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/iron-guard/\">Romania under the Iron Guard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, many scholars, journalists, commentators and elected officials across the political spectrum have <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-024-09934-w\">voiced alarm</a> over escalating acts of violence in the United States, drawing parallels to Europe’s authoritarian past. Reports of <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024\">politically motivated violence are distressingly common</a> – ranging from mass shootings, car-ramming attacks and assaults at demonstrations to assassination attempts, kidnappings and threats targeting mayors, governors, political activists and members of Congress. </p>\n\n<p>For example, threats of violence against members of Congress increased by more than 1,400%, from 902 in 2016 to an estimated 14,000 by the end of 2025, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-lawmakers-personal-security-threats-kirk-safety-d1eb88b5e80710aff20ba7a098bf64f8\">according to U.S. Capitol Police reports</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Political violence is certainly not new in American society, but current patterns differ in key ways. We found that, today, white nationalism is a key driver of support for political violence – a sign that white nationalism poses substantial danger to U.S. political stability. </p>\n\n<p>In the 1970s, violence was political theater, aimed at drawing government and public attention to specific policies. Today, it’s personal and deadly, driven by a desire to annihilate.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A page from a letter signed in red pen, 'Weather Underground,' claiming to have perpetrated a bombing of the U.S. Capitol building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=716&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702348/original/file-20251113-56-qb3fx7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Page 5 and envelope of a letter received by The Associated Press in Washington D.C., on March 2, 1971, signed by ‘Weather Underground,’ which claims responsibility for the March 1 bombing of the U.S. Capitol building.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/WeatherUndergroundLetter/e3ce000e08f24e0c93740593ed92d61f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Changing targets</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-politics-violence/\">In the 1970s</a>, radical left-wing groups often targeted government property to send political messages. </p>\n\n<p>Attacks included the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/weather-underground-bombings\">anti–Vietnam War bombings carried out by the Weather Underground</a>, as well as actions by groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/guerrilla-rise-and-fall-symbionese-liberation-army/\">Symbionese Liberation Army</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4135/9781412980173.n407\">United Freedom Front</a>. They struck government and corporate targets to protest imperialism, racism and economic inequality. These attacks were generally intended as statements rather than mass-casualty events, with perpetrators often issuing warnings beforehand to <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/terrorism-perspectives-from-the-social-sciences-9780197599877?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">minimize harm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, however, much of the violence is aimed directly at individuals, often with the intent to harm or kill <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en\">political opponents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These include incidents such as the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/14/532921612/what-we-know-about-the-suspect-in-gop-baseball-practice-shooting\">2017 shooting</a> targeting Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5171029/man-who-attacked-nancy-pelosis-husband-gets-life-in-prison\">2022 hammer attack</a> on Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/28/g-s1-74962/minnesota-melissa-hortman-funeral-house-speaker\">the 2025 killing of Democrat Melissa Hortman, the former speaker of the Minnesota House</a>, and her husband in what authorities described as a politically motivated assassination. </p>\n\n<p>This resurgence of political violence has prompted intense academic and journalistic scrutiny. Numerous public opinion surveys have sought to gauge Americans’ approval of, or concern about, using violence against the government or political adversaries. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prri.org/research/threats-to-american-democracy-ahead-of-an-unprecedented-presidential-election/\">Initial estimates</a> suggested nearly 1 in 4 Americans support political violence. But later <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116870119\">studies identified flaws</a> in the questions used to measure support for violence. Simply asking about violence in general or the use of force leaves too much room for interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>Using more sophisticated questioning techniques results in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/far-fewer-americans-support-political-violence-than-recent-polls-suggest-266113\">lower estimates</a> of public support for political violence.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what drives individuals to endorse political violence is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent it. As public opinion researchers who have studied <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azae025\">Americans’ attitudes</a> toward ideological extremism, political polarization and counterterrorism policy, we sought to advance our understanding of the factors underlying public support for political violence in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>We aimed to do this in two ways: by using more specific questioning techniques and by identifying the factors associated with increased support for violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Who justifies political violence?</h2>\n\n<p>Our study focused specifically on <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/722762\">white nationalism</a> – a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197500484.001.0001\">growing movement</a> in the U.S. –  as a driver of support for violence. </p>\n\n<p>We asked <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2025.2504966\">a national sample of 1,300 Americans</a> how justified or unjustified it would be “to take violent action against the U.S. government” in response to a range of government actions. This approach captures both approval of the use of violence and its political motivation. </p>\n\n<p>We included nonpartisan government actions such as “the government violated or took away citizens’ rights and freedoms” and “the government violated the U.S. Constitution” along with hypothetical actions reflecting right or left-wing political causes. For example, a right-wing action would be to ban all abortions while a left-wing action would be to legalize all abortions.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"u4mJ2\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u4mJ2/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Analyses revealed substantial support for violence against the government in response to the nonpartisan government actions. Half of the respondents indicated that violence would be justified if the government violated citizens’ rights, and 55% supported the use of violence as a response if the U.S. government committed unlawful violence against citizens. Nearly 40% said that violence would be justified if the government censored the news.</p>\n\n<p>When we examined the factors behind these attitudes, a belief in white nationalism stood out above all others. But what, precisely, is white nationalism? It is more than simply identifying as white. Indeed, white nationalism is a sentiment found among some <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306352/whiteshift-by-kaufmann-eric/9780141986630\">nonwhite Americans</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>White nationalists are concerned about the increasing diversity of the American population and want to ensure that white citizens maintain a predominant influence in the country. To them, white citizens’ social, cultural and political values are superior to those of nonwhite citizens and immigrants. The perceived need to protect and propagate these values serves as a call to action. </p>\n\n<p>This ideology has motivated several recent acts of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/great-replacement-theory-inspired-terror-attacks-recent-years-1706953\">mass violence</a>, from synagogue shootings to racially targeted attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Our data revealed that a belief in white nationalism predicted support for political violence as well. In response to both nonpartisan government actions and those that would benefit left-wing causes, the stronger a person’s white nationalist sentiment, the more strongly that individual believed that violence would be justified. </p>\n\n<p>Out of all the variables in our statistical models, including political views and demographic characteristics, white nationalism was the strongest predictor of support for violence in these circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>It did not, however, significantly influence support for violence when the government actions would benefit right-wing causes.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"jqFx3\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jqFx3/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Growing threat to US democracy</h2>\n\n<p>Most people who voice support for political violence will never commit violent acts <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295747\">themselves</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet such attitudes foster an atmosphere of tolerance, signaling that violence is acceptable and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-criminol-030521-102553\">enabling its continuation</a>. Our analyses show that <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2025.2504966\">these supportive attitudes are prevalent among white nationalists.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/\">Active white nationalist groups</a> operate in all but two U.S. states, Alaska and Vermont. Decentralized groups, such as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/active-clubs-are-white-supremacys-new-dangerous-frontier-262786\">Active Clubs</a>, where white nationalists train and network, are also on the rise. </p>\n\n<p>Many more individuals <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2024.102244\">hold white nationalist sentiments</a> without belonging to organized groups. Indeed, in our national sample, one quarter of respondents agreed with the statement “although people won’t admit it, White Americans and their culture are what made America great in the first place.”</p>\n\n<p>The fact that white nationalism is gaining prominence in the U.S., combined with the association between holding white nationalist views and supporting political violence found in our study, indicates that white nationalism poses a serious threat to U.S. political stability.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268480/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It’s certainly hard to look at, yet to look away or try to forget it means to ignore what it has to say about the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-list-smithsonian-exhibits-2117594\">complicated and often brutal history of the nation</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In Trump’s view, these memorials are “revisionist” and “driven by ideology rather than truth.” In an executive order named <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/\">Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</a>, Trump said public materials should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the president appears to want a history that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history\">celebrates American achievement</a> rather than being forced to look at “The Scourged Back” and other historical realities that document aspects of the American story that don’t warrant celebration. </p>\n\n<h2>Combating ignorance of slavery’s horrors</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking back to the decades leading up to the Civil War, facts were the weapon abolitionists wielded in their fight against the distortions of pro-slavery forces. It was an uphill battle in the face of indifference by many in the North. After a visit to Massachusetts in 1830, abolitionist writer William Lloyd Garrison <a href=\"https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook_print.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=348\">blamed such attitudes</a> on “exceeding ignorance of the horrors of slavery.” </p>\n\n<p>It is not surprising that in the early 19th century many Americans would have had limited knowledge of slavery. Travel was arduous, time-consuming and expensive, and  most Northerners had little firsthand exposure to slave societies. Abolitionists argued that those who did visit the South were often shielded from the harsher realities of slavery. This extended to the media ecosystem, which lacked any real national news organizations. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Southern plantation owners carried out a robust propaganda effort to extol the beneficence of their economic system. In <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1641\">letters</a>, <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1641\">pamphlets</a> and books, they argued that slavery was beneficial to all and that the enslaved were happy and well-treated. They also attacked their opponents as evil and dishonest.</p>\n\n<p>As abolitionist Lydia Maria Child <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbaapc.05000/?st=gallery\">wrote in 1838</a>: “The apologists of Southern slavery are accustomed to brand every picture of slavery and its fruits as exaggeration or calumny.” </p>\n\n<h2>Don’t look away</h2>\n\n<p>Thus, the challenge for abolitionists was to show slavery as it really was – and to compel people to look. An emphasis on hard evidence took firm hold in the wave of abolitionism in the 1830s.</p>\n\n<p>Activists didn’t yet have photography, so they relied on accounts from eyewitnesses and formerly enslaved people, official reports and even some plantation owners’ own words in <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2019/10/runaway-fugitive-slave-ads-in-newspapers/\">Southern newspaper advertisements seeking the return of runaways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Until the pictures of the slave’s sufferings were drawn up and held up to public gaze, no Northerner had any idea of the cruelty of the system,” abolitionist Angelina Grimké wrote in her famous “<a href=\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/appeal-to-christian-women-of-the-south-2/\">Appeal to the Christian Women of the South</a>” in 1836.</p>\n\n<p>“It never entered their minds that such abominations could exist in Christian, Republican America; they never suspected that many of the gentlemen and ladies who came from the South to spend the summer months in travelling among them, were petty tyrants at home,” Grimké wrote.</p>\n\n<p>In pamphlets and newspapers, Grimké and others laid down a documentary record of the abuses of slavery, naming names and emphasizing legal evidence of their claims. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/08821127.2022.2133024\">In my research</a>, I have argued that while abolitionists didn’t invent the journalistic exposé, they did develop the first fully articulated methodology for confronting abuses of power through carefully documented facts – laying the groundwork for later generations of investigative reporters and fact-checkers.</p>\n\n<p>Most critically, what they did is point a finger at injustice and demand that America not look away. In its first issue, in 1835, the newspaper Human Rights emphasized “the importance of first settling what slavery really is.” Inside, it included a series of advertisements documenting slave sales and rewards for runaways reprinted from Southern newspapers. </p>\n\n<p>The headline: “ <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3990/human_rights_v1n1_page_3_highlight.heic.pdf?1763325442\">LOOK AT THIS!!</a>”</p>\n\n<h2>Tried and acquitted</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a woman in a bonnet poses for a photograph\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=895&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703243/original/file-20251118-56-blkzdd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1125&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Angelina Grimké was an abolitionist writer.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a03341/\">Library of Congress</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One of the most remarkable efforts in this abolitionist campaign was a 233-page pamphlet called “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DKC0106/page/n4/mode/1up\">American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses</a>.” Published in 1839 by Theodore Dwight Weld along with his wife, Angelina Grimké, and her sister, it was an exhaustively documented exposé of floggings, torture, killings, overwork and undernourishment. </p>\n\n<p>One example involved a wealthy tobacconist who whipped a 15-year-old girl to death: “While he was whipping her, his wife heated a smoothing iron, put it on her body in various places, and burned her severely. The verdict of the coroner’s inquest was, ‘Died of excessive whipping.’ He was tried in Richmond and acquitted.”</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult reading, to be sure, and certainly the kind of material that might foster “a national sense of shame,” as Trump’s executive order claims. But getting rid of the evils of slavery meant first acknowledging them. And the second part – critical to avoiding the mistakes of the past – is remembering them.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Consciences shocked’</h2>\n\n<p>So how effective was this abolitionist campaign to lay bare the terrible facts about slavery? </p>\n\n<p>At least some readers of “<a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3987/Pages_from_Weld_Slavery_as_It_Is.pdf?1762977572\">American Slavery As It Is</a>” had their consciences shocked. <a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3988/Emancipator_published_as_The_Emancipator___June_13_1839_%281%29.pdf?1762977804\">One New Hampshire newspaper reacted this way</a>: “We thought we knew something of the horrid character of slavery before, but upon looking over the pages of this book, we find that we had no adequate idea of the number and enormity of the cruelties which are constantly being perpetrated under this system of all abominations.” </p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.keytouncletomsca00stow/?sp=25&amp;r=0.151,0.065,1.395,0.729,0\">one famous reader was Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, who drew on the book as inspiration for “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” published more than a decade later. </p>\n\n<p>The 1830s reflected the height of the abolitionist movement in books, pamphlets and newspapers. While the activism continued in the 1840s and 1850s, ultimately it took secession and civil war to finally end slavery. But, of course, it didn’t take long for the country to fall into a prolonged period of formal and informal segregation in both the North and the South, many vestiges of which remain.</p>\n\n<p>That reality of a history that doesn’t proceed along a straight path to justice underscores the importance of preserving, remembering and teaching difficult parts of the past such as “The Scourged Back.”</p>\n\n<p>On the title page of “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DKC0106/page/n4/mode/1up\">American Slavery As It Is</a>,” Weld and the Grimkés printed a quote from the biblical book of Ezekiel: “Behold the wicked abominations that they do.” It was a command to the nation to look without flinching at what it was, and it is as pertinent today as it was then.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was corrected to include the correct image of Angelina Grimké.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266424/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gerry Lanosga does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

My ongoing investigation of the laws suggests that, 20 years on, they have not made communities any safer, nor have they helped prevent crime. In fact, there is reliable evidence they have done just the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 20 years, stand your ground has spread to 38 states. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in September 2025, an appellate court <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/10/appeals-court-strikes-down-floridas-open-carry-law/86075928007/\">struck down Florida’s long-standing ban</a> on the open carry of firearms.</p>\n\n<p>Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, quickly announced that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-open-carry-law-what-to-know-gun-rights-control/\">open carry is now “the law of the state</a>,” directing law enforcement not to arrest people who display handguns in public.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ron-desantis-quietly-signs-permitless-concealed-carry-law-rcna77934\">Under the state’s permitless carry law</a>, enacted in 2023, adults without a criminal record also <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/constitutional-carry-donald-trump-guns-without-permits\">don’t need a permit or any training</a> to carry firearms publicly.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, this combination of stand your ground, open carry and permitless carry is likely to make the Sunshine State far less safe.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at the evidence.</p>\n\n<h2>What ‘stand your ground’ means</h2>\n\n<p>Under traditional self-defense law, a person had a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8GwNpFQgflw\">duty to retreat</a> – to try to avoid a violent confrontation if they could safely do so – before resorting to deadly force.</p>\n\n<p>The main exception to the duty to retreat was known as the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/castle_doctrine\">castle doctrine</a>, whereby people could defend themselves, with force if necessary, if they were attacked in their own homes.</p>\n\n<p>Stand your ground laws effectively expand the boundaries of the castle doctrine to the wider world, removing the duty to retreat and allowing people to use lethal force anywhere they have a legal right to be, as long as they believe it’s necessary to prevent death or serious harm.</p>\n\n<p>On paper, the expansion of the right to self-defense may sound reasonable. But in practice, stand your ground laws have <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2711425\">blurred the line between self-defense and aggression</a> by <a href=\"https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2022/01/the-dangerous-expansion-of-stand-your-ground-laws-and-its-racial-implications\">expanding legal immunity</a> for some who claim self-defense and shifting the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/04/bill-to-shift-stand-your-ground-burden-of-proof-to-prosecutors-clears-house-floor-111051\">burden of proof to prosecutors</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While supporters of these laws claim they mitigate crime and make people safer, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.0077\">evidence shows the opposite</a>. The nonpartisan RAND Corp. discovered that states adopting stand your ground laws experienced <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground.html\">significant increases in homicide</a>, typically between 8% and 11% higher than before the laws took effect.</p>\n\n<p>A study of violent crime in Florida revealed <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6811\">a 31.6% increase in firearm homicides</a> following the 2005 passage of the stand your ground law. There is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306101\">no credible evidence</a> that these laws deter crime. </p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, evidence shows that stand your ground laws <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground.html\">lower the legal, moral and psychological costs</a> of <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/22/stand-your-ground-laws-linked-to-higher-homicide-rates-new-report-finds/#:%7E:text=People%20are%20more%20likely%20to,United%20States?\">pulling the trigger</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Stand your ground and race</h2>\n\n<p>While the language of stand your ground laws is race-neutral, their enforcement is not. Data from the <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/race-justifiable-homicide-and-stand-your-ground-laws\">Urban Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.usccr.gov/reports/2020/examining-race-effects-stand-your-ground-laws-and-related-issues\">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a> show that in states with stand your ground laws, homicides are far more likely to be deemed “justified” when the shooter is white and the victim is Black.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve found that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/stand-your-ground-laws-empower-armed-citizens-to-defend-property-with-violence-a-simple-mistake-can-get-you-shot-or-killed-204012\">these laws have redefined</a> not only when force is justified but who is justified in using force.</p>\n\n<p>In my assessment, these laws don’t create racial bias. Rather, they magnify the biases already present in our criminal legal system. They give broader discretion to a legal system in which law enforcement officers, judges, prosecutors and juries often hold unacknowledged biases that associate <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000092\">Black men with criminality</a>, while perceiving white people who say they were defending themselves as credible.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A sign for a rally after the Trayvon Martin shooting in Sanford, Florida.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701430/original/file-20251110-56-b0c1en.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin was unarmed when George Zimmerman shot and killed him on March 20, 2012, in Sanford, Fla.

And when the law tells you that you don’t have to back down, that perception can turn lethal in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Florida has become a model for what <a href=\"https://www.nrablog.com/articles/2016/5/the-truth-is-we-are-freedoms-safest-place\">gun rights advocates</a> call “freedom” but what <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306101\">public health experts</a> see as a recipe for more shootings and more death.</p>\n\n<h2>National implications: ‘Reciprocity’ and expansion</h2>\n\n<p>Two decades later, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-which-states-have-stand-your-ground-laws-10904209\">stand your ground laws have spread</a>, in various forms, to 38 states. While 30 states have legislatively enacted stand your ground statutes like Florida’s, eight others implement stand your ground <a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/stand-your-ground-laws-50-state-survey/#:%7E:text=California%20has%20a%20judicial%20stand,instructions%20also%20provide%20this%20rule\">through case law and jury instructions</a> that effectively remove the duty to retreat.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"epncB\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/epncB/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>On top of this, 29 states have enacted laws allowing permitless carry, and 47 <a href=\"https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/blog/what-is-open-carry-and-which-states-allow-it/\">technically allow open carry</a>, though restrictions vary across the states. </p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to take this deregulatory approach nationwide. While on the campaign trail, he <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/maga-meter-tracking-donald-trumps-2024-promises/promise/1659/expand-concealed-carry-rights/article/3197/\">promised to sign a “concealed-carry reciprocity” law</a>, which would require all states to allow people from states with permissive laws to exercise those rights in all 50. “Your Second Amendment does not end at the state line,” he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-violence-prevention-groups-brace-trump-promise-concealed/story?id=115749093\">announced in a 2023 video</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If that vision becomes reality, it would mean the most permissive state laws will set the standard for the entire country. National reciprocity would allow Floridians, and other gun owners from permitless carry states, to carry their firearms – and potentially claim stand your ground immunity – in any other state, including those with stricter rules and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/us/everytown-weak-gun-laws-high-gun-deaths-study\">lower rates of firearm death and injury</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This prospect raises deep questions about states’ rights, safety and justice. Research shows that stand your ground laws increase homicide and exacerbate racial disparities. National reciprocity would export those effects nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the convergence of stand your ground, open carry and national reciprocity marks the culmination of a 20-year experiment in armed citizenship. The results are clear: more people armed, more shootings and more deaths “justified.”</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether the rest of the nation will follow Florida’s lead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267496/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Caroline Light is affiliated with GVPedia and collaborates with Giffords. </span></em></p>",

Human brains are <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2024/winter/pareidolia-faces-in-nature/\">hardwired</a> for this kind of whimsy. But some people – perhaps a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">surprising number</a> – look to the sky and see government plots and wicked deeds written there. Conspiracy theorists say that <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/contrails/fact-sheet\">contrails</a> – long streaks of condensation left by aircraft – are actually chemtrails, clouds of chemical or biological agents dumped on the unsuspecting public for nefarious purposes. Different motives are ascribed, from weather control to mass poisoning.</p>\n\n<p>The chemtrails theory has circulated <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">since 1996</a>, when conspiracy theorists misinterpreted a U.S. Air Force research paper about <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10829/critical-issues-in-weather-modification-research\">weather modification</a>, a valid topic of research. Social media and conservative news outlets have since magnified the conspiracy theory. One recent study notes that X, formerly Twitter, is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-017-0014-3\">particularly active node</a> of this “broad online community of conspiracy.” </p>\n\n<p>I’m a communications researcher who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=BKTIoPkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies conspiracy theories</a>. The thoroughly debunked chemtrails theory provides a textbook example of how conspiracy theories work.</p>\n\n<h2>Boosted into the stratosphere</h2>\n\n<p>Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, whose podcast <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/media/tucker-carlson-podcast-surges-maga-feud-ted-cruz-mark-levin\">averages over a million viewers</a> per episode, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8A6hkS1CUE\">recently interviewed</a> Dane Wigington, a longtime opponent of what he calls “<a href=\"https://geoengineeringwatch.org/\">geoengineering</a>.” While the interview has been <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/tucker-carlson-chemtrails-episode-climate-change-geoengineering.html\">extensively</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory_n_6913e26be4b0c374cf5196d9?ncid=NEWSSTAND0001\">discredited</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/f-cking-moron-tucker-carlson-202630283.html\">mocked</a> in other media coverage, it is only one example of the spike in chemtrail belief.</p>\n\n<p>Although chemtrail belief spans the political spectrum, it is particularly evident in Republican circles. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/26/chemtrail-conspiracy-theories-rfk-climate-crisis\">professed his support</a> for the theory. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4403/text\">written legislation</a> to ban chemical weather control, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/08/chemtrails-us-states-legislation\">many state legislatures</a> have done the same. </p>\n\n<p>Online influencers with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricanes-chemtrail-conspiracy-theory-trump\">millions of followers</a> have promoted what was once a fringe theory to a large audience. It finds a ready audience among climate change deniers and anti-deep state agitators who fear government mind control.</p>\n\n<h2>Heads I win, tails you lose</h2>\n\n<p>Although research on weather modification is real, the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/chemtrails-debunked-in-new-study\">overwhelming majority</a> of <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/atmospheric-science-experts-agree-chemtrails-fantasy\">qualified</a> <a href=\"https://www.aerosociety.com/news/chemtrails-debunked/\">experts</a> deny that the chemtrail theory has any solid basis in fact. For example, geoengineering researcher <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=PfciJkgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">David Keith</a>’s lab posted a <a href=\"https://davidkeith.earth/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory/\">blunt statement</a> on its website. A wealth of other resources <a href=\"https://www.redalyc.org/journal/5117/511766757028/html/\">exist</a> online, and many of their conclusions are posted at <a href=\"https://contrailscience.com/\">contrailscience.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But even without a deep dive into the science, the chemtrail theory has glaring logical problems. Two of them are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/criterion-of-falsifiability\">falsifiability</a> and parsimony.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-X8Xfl0JdTQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The philosopher Karl Popper explains that unless your conjecture can be proved false, it lies outside the realm of science.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>According to psychologist <a href=\"https://conspiracypsychology.com/\">Rob Brotherton</a>, conspiracy theories have a classic “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Suspicious_Minds/awrcCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=brotherton+suspicious+minds+heads+i+win&amp;pg=PA75&amp;printsec=frontcover\">heads I win, tails you lose</a>” structure. Conspiracy theorists say that chemtrails are part of a nefarious government plot, but its existence has been covered up by the same villains. If there was any evidence that weather modification was actually happening, that would support the theory, but any evidence denying chemtrails also supports the theory – specifically, the part that alleges a cover-up. </p>\n\n<p>People who subscribe to the conspiracy theory consider anyone who confirms it to be a brave whistleblower and anyone who denies it to be foolish, evil or paid off. Therefore, no amount of information could even hypothetically disprove it for true believers. This denial makes the theory <a href=\"https://blogs.iu.edu/sciu/2021/07/31/what-does-it-mean-for-science-to-be-falsifiable/\">nonfalsifiable</a>, meaning it’s impossible to disprove. By contrast, good theories are not false, but they must also be constructed in such a way that if they were false, evidence could show that. </p>\n\n<p>Nonfalsifiable theories are inherently suspect because they exist in a closed loop of self-confirmation. In practice, theories are not usually declared “false” based on a single test but are taken more or less seriously based on the <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-idea-that-a-scientific-theory-can-be-falsified-is-a-myth/\">preponderance of good evidence and scientific consensus</a>. This approach is important because conspiracy theories and disinformation often claim to falsify mainstream theories, or at least <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2014.0455\">exploit a poor understanding</a> of what certainty means in scientific methods.</p>\n\n<p>Like most conspiracy theories, the chemtrail story tends not to meet the criteria of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/\">parsimony</a>, also known as Occam’s razor, which suggests that the more suppositions a theory requires to be true, the less likely it actually is. While <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/contrary-to-occams-razor-the-simplest-explanation-is-often-not-the-best-one/\">not perfect</a>, this concept can be an important way to think about probability <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.15086\">when it comes to conspiracy theories</a>. Is it more likely that the government is covering up a massive weather program, mind-control program or both that involve thousands or millions of silent, complicit agents, from the local weather reporter to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or that we’re seeing ice crystals from plane engines? </p>\n\n<p>Of course, calling something a “conspiracy theory” <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429020353\">does not automatically invalidate it</a>. After all, real conspiracies do exist. But it’s important to remember scientist and science communicator <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/articles-and-essays/carl-sagan-and-the-tradition-of-science/carl-sagan-researcher-educator-communicator-advocate-and-activist\">Carl Sagan</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/159724/brocas-brain-by-carl-sagan/\">adage</a> that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-are-chemtrails-made-of/\">In the case of chemtrails</a>, the evidence just isn’t there.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9xtpqXzyfA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Scientists explain how humans are susceptible to believing conspiracy theories.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Psychology of conspiracy theory belief</h2>\n\n<p>If the evidence against it is so powerful and the logic is so weak, why do people believe the chemtrail conspiracy theory? As I have argued in my new book, “<a href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/post-weird/9781978840164/\">Post-Weird: Fragmentation, Community, and the Decline of the Mainstream</a>,” conspiracy theorists create bonds with each other through shared practices of interpreting the world, seeing every detail and scrap of evidence as unshakable signs of a larger, hidden meaning. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003317623-23\">Uncertainty</a>, ambiguity and chaos can be overwhelming. Conspiracy theories are symptoms, ad hoc attempts to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.111966\">deal with the anxiety</a> caused by feelings of powerlessness in a chaotic and complicated world where <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.112042\">awful things</a> like tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires can happen seemingly at random for reasons that even well-informed people struggle to understand. When people feel overwhelmed and helpless, they create fantasies that <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/bul0000392\">give an illusion of mastery and control</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although there are liberal chemtrail believers, aversion to uncertainty might explain why the theory has become so popular with Carlson’s audience: Researchers have <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/4421-the-authoritarian-personality\">long</a> <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-authoritarian-personality\">argued</a> that authoritarian, right-wing beliefs have a similar underlying structure.</p>\n\n<p>On some level, chemtrail theorists would rather be targets of an evil conspiracy than face the limits of their knowledge and power, even though conspiracy beliefs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417718261\">are not completely satisfying</a>. Sigmund Freud described a <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/76031\">fort-da</a> (“gone-here”) game played by his grandson where he threw away a toy and dragged it back on a string, something Freud interpreted as a simulation of control when the child had none. Conspiracy theories may serve a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00335630.2016.1155127\">similar purpose</a>, allowing their believers to feel that the world isn’t really random and that they, the ones who see through the charade, really have some control over it. The grander the conspiracy, the more brilliant and heroic the conspiracy theorists must be. </p>\n\n<p>Conspiracies are dramatic and exciting, with clear lines of good and evil, whereas real life is boring and sometimes scary. The chemtrail theory is ultimately prideful. It’s a way for theorists to feel powerful and smart when they face things beyond their comprehension and control. Conspiracy theories come and go, but responding to them in the long term means finding better ways to embrace uncertainty, ambiguity and our own limits alongside a new embrace of the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-to-tell-if-a-conspiracy-theory-is-probably-false-229081\">tools we do have</a>: logic, evidence and even humility.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269770/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Calum Lister Matheson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Although the second launch is never as flashy as the first, this mission is still significant in several ways.</p>\n\n<p>For one, it launched a pair of NASA spacecraft named <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/escapade/\">ESCAPADE</a>, which are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nasa-goes-on-an-escapade-twin-small-low-cost-orbiters-will-examine-mars-atmosphere-269321\">headed to Mars orbit</a> to study that planet’s magnetic environment and atmosphere. The twin spacecraft will first <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/escapade/2025/11/13/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-go-for-launch/\">travel to a Lagrange point</a>, a place where the gravity between Earth, the Moon and the Sun balances. The ESCAPADE spacecraft will remain there until Mars is in better alignment to travel to.</p>\n\n<p>And two, importantly for Blue Origin, New Glenn’s first stage booster successfully <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/science/blue-origin-launch-rocket.html\">returned to Earth and landed</a> on a barge at sea. This landing allows the booster to be reused, substantially reducing the cost to get to space.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pviGlY1PiHQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Blue Origin launched its New Glenn rocket and landed the booster on a barge at sea on Nov. 13, 2025.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PxIOz7cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">space policy expert</a>, I see this launch as a positive development for the commercial space industry. Even though SpaceX has pioneered this form of launch and reuse, New Glenn’s capabilities are just as important.  </p>\n\n<h2>New Glenn in context</h2>\n\n<p>Although Blue Origin would seem to be following in SpaceX’s footsteps with New Glenn, there are <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/new-glenn-rocket-launch-blue-origin-jeff-bezos-spacex-2010183\">significant differences</a> between the two companies and their rockets.</p>\n\n<p>For most launches today, the rocket consists of several parts. The first stage helps propel the rocket and its spacecraft toward space and then drops away when its fuel is used up. A second stage then takes over, propelling the payload all the way to orbit.</p>\n\n<p>While both New Glenn and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX’s most powerful rocket currently available, are partially reusable, <a href=\"https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/08/19/titans-of-the-new-space-race-comparing-blue-origins-new-glenn-and-spacexs-falcon-heavy/\">New Glenn</a> is taller, more powerful and can carry a greater amount of payload to orbit.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Origin <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn\">plans to use</a> New Glenn for a variety of missions for customers such as NASA, Amazon and others. These will include missions to Earth’s orbit and eventually to the Moon to support Blue Origin’s own lunar and space exploration goals, as well as NASA’s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/\">NASA’s Artemis program</a>, which endeavors to return humans to the Moon, is where New Glenn may become important. In the past several months, several <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/10/30/former-nasa-administrators-urge-space-agency-to-rethink-plans-for-artemis-moon-lander/\">space policy leaders</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/duffy-nasa-to-reopen-artemis-3-hls-contract/\">NASA officials</a>, have expressed concern that Artemis is progressing too slowly. If Artemis stagnates, China may have the opportunity to leap ahead and beat NASA and its partners to the lunar south pole.</p>\n\n<p>These concerns stem from problems with two rockets that could potentially bring Americans back to the Moon: the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/\">space launch system</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/spacex-launches-most-powerful-rocket-in-history-in-explosive-debut-like-many-first-liftoffs-starships-test-was-a-successful-failure-204248\">SpaceX’s Starship</a>. NASA’s space launch system, which will launch astronauts on its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/\">Orion crew vehicle</a>, has been criticized as <a href=\"https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4924/1\">too complex and costly</a>. SpaceX’s Starship is important because NASA plans to use it to land humans on the Moon during the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/\">Artemis III mission</a>. But its development has been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-gone-wrong-between-nasa-and-elon-musks-spacex-268577\">much slower</a> than anticipated.  </p>\n\n<p>In response, Blue Origin has <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/10/28/blue-origin-details-lunar-exploration-progress-amid-artemis-3-contract-shakeup/\">detailed some</a> of its lunar exploration plans. They will begin with the launch of its uncrewed lunar lander, <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon\">Blue Moon</a>, early next year. The company is also developing a crewed version of Blue Moon that it will use on the Artemis V mission, the planned third lunar landing of humans. </p>\n\n<p>Blue Origin officials have said <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/10/28/blue-origin-details-lunar-exploration-progress-amid-artemis-3-contract-shakeup/\">they are in discussions</a> with NASA over how they might help accelerate the Artemis program.</p>\n\n<h2>New Glenn’s significance</h2>\n\n<p>New Glenn’s booster landing makes this most recent launch quite significant for the company. While it took SpaceX <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_first-stage_landing_tests\">several tries</a> to land its first booster, Blue Origin has achieved this feat on only the second try. Landing the boosters – and, more importantly, reusing them – has been key to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-spacex-lowered-costs-and-reduced-barriers-to-space-112586\">reducing the cost</a> to get to space for SpaceX, as well as others such as Rocket Lab.</p>\n\n<p>That two commercial space companies now have orbital rockets that can be partially reused shows that SpaceX’s success was no fluke.</p>\n\n<p>With this accomplishment, Blue Origin has been able to build on its previous experience and success with its suborbital rocket, <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/new-shepard\">New Shepard</a>. Launching from Blue Origin facilities in Texas since 2015, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard\">New Shepard has taken</a> people and cargo to the edge of space, before returning to its launch site under its own power.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A short, wide rocket lifts off from a launchpad.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702568/original/file-20251114-56-uxgzrg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Blue Origin’s suborbital rocket, New Shepard.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/blue-origins-new-shepard-lifts-off-from-the-launch-pad-news-photo/1329693390?adppopup=true\">Joe Raedle/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>New Glenn is also significant for the larger commercial space industry and U.S. space capabilities. It represents real <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bezos-blue-origin-has-successfully-launched-its-new-glenn-rocket-to-orbit-a-feat-15-years-in-the-making-247424\">competition for SpaceX</a>, especially its Starship rocket. It also provides <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bezos-blue-origin-has-successfully-launched-its-new-glenn-rocket-to-orbit-a-feat-15-years-in-the-making-247424\">more launch options</a> for NASA, the U.S. government and other commercial customers, reducing reliance on SpaceX or any other launch company.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Blue Origin is looking to build on the success of New Glenn’s launch and its booster landing. New Glenn will <a href=\"https://rocketlaunch.org/launch-schedule/blue-origin/new-glenn\">next launch</a> Blue Origin’s Blue Moon uncrewed lander in early 2026.</p>\n\n<p>This second successful New Glenn launch will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-awarded-critical-national-security-space-launch-contract\">rocket’s certification</a> for <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12900\">national security space launches</a>. This accomplishment will allow the company to compete for contracts to launch sensitive reconnaissance and defense satellites for the U.S. government. </p>\n\n<p>Blue Origin will also need to increase its number of launches and reduce the time between them to compete with SpaceX. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/with-another-record-broken-the-worlds-busiest-spaceport-keeps-getting-busier/\">SpaceX is on pace</a> for between 165 and 170 launches in 2025 alone. While Blue Origin may not be able to achieve that remarkable cadence, to truly build on New Glenn’s success it will need to show it can scale up its launch operations.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269786/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Wendy Whitman Cobb is affiliated with the US School of Advanced Air and Space Studies.

However, amid the joy of gathering and indulging in delicious food, it is essential to keep food safety in mind. Foodborne illnesses can quickly put a damper on your celebrations. </p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/faculty-and-staff/lisa-cuchara/\">immunologist and infectious disease specialist</a>, I study how germs spread – and how to prevent them from doing so. In my courses, I teach my students how to reduce microbial risks, including those tied to activities such as hosting a big Thanksgiving gathering, without becoming germophobes.</p>\n\n<p>Foodborne illnesses sicken 48 million Americans – <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/about/index.html\">1 in 6 people</a> – each year. Holiday meals such as Thanksgiving pose special risks because these spreads often involve large quantities, long prep times, buffet-style serving and mingling guests. Such conditions create many opportunities for germs to spread.</p>\n\n<p>This, in turn, invites a slew of microbial guests such as <em>Salmonella</em>\nand <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>. Most people recover from infections with foodborne bacteria, but each year <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/about/index.html\">around 3,000 Americans die</a> from the illnesses they cause. More routinely, these bugs can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea within hours to a couple of days after being consumed – which are no fun at a holiday celebration. </p>\n\n<h2>Foods most likely to cause holiday illness</h2>\n\n<p>Most foodborne illnesses come from raw or undercooked food and foods left in the so-called danger zone of cooking temperature – 40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit – in which bacteria multiply rapidly. Large-batch cooking without proper reheating or storage as well as cross contamination of foods during preparation can also cause disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A turkey on a counter being stuffed by two sets of hands.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702259/original/file-20251113-56-i0bne2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Put that bird right in the oven as soon as you’ve stuffed it to keep bacteria from multiplying inside.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/preparing-turkey-for-thanksgiving-dinner-royalty-free-image/1034417874\">kajakiki/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Not all dishes pose the same risk. Turkey can harbor <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em> and <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>. <a href=\"https://foodprotection.org/publications/food-protection-trends/archive/2021-03-consumer-handling-of-whole-turkeys-identification-of-common-mishandling-practices/\">Undercooked turkey remains a leading cause</a> of Thanksgiving-related illness. Raw turkey drippings can also easily spread bacteria onto hands, utensils and counters. And don’t forget the stuffing inside the bird. While the turkey may reach a safe internal temperature, the stuffing often does not, making it a higher-risk dish.</p>\n\n<p>Leftovers stored too long, reheated improperly or cooled slowly also bring hazards. If large pieces of roasted turkey aren’t divided and cooled quickly, any <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> they contain might have time to produce toxins. This increases the risk of getting sick from snacking on leftovers – even reheated leftovers, since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.15906\">these toxins are not killed by heat</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, each November and December <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000825.htm\">outbreaks involving this bacterium spike</a>, often due to encounters with turkey and roast beef leftovers.</p>\n\n<h2>Don’t wash the turkey!</h2>\n\n<p>Washing anything makes it cleaner and safer, right? Not necessarily. </p>\n\n<p>Many people think washing their turkey will remove bacteria. However, it’s pretty much impossible to wash bacteria off a raw bird, and attempting to do so actually increases cross contamination and your risk of foodborne illness. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2005, federal food safety agencies <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/holiday-turkey.html\">have advised against washing turkey or chicken</a>. Despite this, a 2020 survey found that 78% of people still reported rinsing their turkey before cooking – often because older recipes or family habits encourage it. </p>\n\n<p>When you rinse raw poultry, water can splash harmful bacteria around your kitchen, contaminating counter tops, utensils and nearby foods. If you do choose to wash turkey, it’s critical to immediately clean and disinfect the sink and surrounding area. A 2019 USDA study found that 60% of people who <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2019/08/20/washing-raw-poultry-our-science-your-choice\">washed their poultry had bacteria in their sink</a> afterward – and 14% had bacteria in the sink even after cleaning it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Family enjoying Thanksgiving meal\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702261/original/file-20251113-56-sk7afc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A few food prep precautions can help keep the holiday free of gastrointestinal distress.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/happy-woman-and-her-extended-family-during-royalty-free-image/1740855806\">Drazen Zigic/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Food prep tips for a safe and healthy Thanksgiving</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Wash your hands regularly.</strong> Before cooking and after touching raw meat, poultry or eggs, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\">at least 20 seconds</a>. Improper handwashing by people handling food is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/827965\">major source of bacterial contamination</a> with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. This bacterium’s toxins are hard to break down, even after cooking or reheating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thaw turkey safely.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/poultry/turkey-basics-safe-thawing\">safest way to thaw a turkey</a> is in the refrigerator. Allow 24 hours per 4-5 pounds. There’s also a faster method, which involves <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/poultry/your-safe-thanksgiving-guide\">submerging the turkey in cold water</a> and changing the water every 30 minutes – but it’s not as safe because it requires constant attention to ensure the water temperature stays below 40 F in order to prevent swift bacteria growth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stuff your turkey immediately before cooking it.</strong> Stuffing the turkey the night before is risky because it allows bacteria in the stuffing to multiply overnight. The toxins produced by those bacteria do not break down upon cooking, and the interior of the stuffing may not get hot enough to kill those bacteria. The <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/food-safety-tips-healthy-holidays\">USDA specifically warns against prestuffing</a>. So <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/holiday-turkey.html\">cook stuffing separately</a>, if possible, or if you prefer it inside the bird, stuff immediately before roasting, making sure it reaches 165 F.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cook food to the right temperature.</strong> A thermometer is your best friend – use it to ensure <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/poultry/your-safe-thanksgiving-guide\">turkey and stuffing both reach 165 F</a>. Check <a href=\"https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts\">casseroles and other dishes</a> too. It’s best not to rely on an <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/meat-thermometers/meat-thermometer-or-pop-up-timer-for-turkey\">internal pop-up thermometer</a>, since they can be inaccurate, imprecise and could even malfunction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid cross contamination.</strong> Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, vegetables and bread. Change utensils and plates after handling raw meat before using them for cooked foods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep food at safe temperatures.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/programs-services/disease-prevention/infectious-disease-control/enteric-diseases-foodborne-and/food\">Serve hot foods immediately</a>, and make sure hot foods are served above 140 F and cold dishes below 40 F to keep them out of the microbial danger zone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be cautious with buffet-style serving.</strong> Limit food time on the table to two hours or less – longer than that, any bacteria present can <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/danger-zone-40f-140f\">double every 20 minutes</a>. Provide dedicated serving utensils, and avoid letting guests serve with utensils they have eaten from.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be mindful of expiration dates.</strong> Don’t forget to check dates on food items to make sure that what you are serving isn’t expired or left from last Thanksgiving. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Educate guests on food safety.</strong> Remind guests to wash their hands before preparing or serving food, and politely discourage double-dipping or tasting directly from communal dishes.</p>\n\n<p>Thanksgiving should be a time of gratitude, not gastrointestinal distress. By following these simple food safety tips, you can help ensure a safe and healthy holiday.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269320/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lisa Cuchara does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

You’re not alone.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KKQXJ_8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">labor economist</a> who studies how technology and organizational change affect productivity and well-being. In a study published in an <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5386372\">August 2025 working paper</a>, I found that the way people allocate their time to work has changed profoundly since the COVID-19 pandemic began.</p>\n\n<p>For example, among professionals in occupations that can be done remotely, 35% to 40% worked remotely on Thursdays and Fridays in 2024, compared with only 15% in 2019. On Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, nearly 30% worked remotely, versus 10% to 15% five years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>And white-collar employees have also become more likely to log off from work early on Fridays. They’re starting the weekend sooner than before the pandemic, whether while working at an office or remotely as the workweek comes to a close. Why is that happening? I suspect that remote work has diluted the barrier between the workweek and the weekend – especially when employees aren’t working at the office.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>The changing rhythm of work</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/tus/\">American Time Use Survey</a>, which the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts annually, asks thousands of Americans to recount how they spent the previous day, minute by minute. It tracks how long they spend working, commuting, doing housework and caregiving.</p>\n\n<p>Because these diaries cover both weekdays and weekends, and include information about whether respondents could work remotely, this survey offers the most detailed picture available of how the rhythms of work and life are changing. This data also allows me to see where people conduct each activity, making it possible to estimate the share of time American professionals spend working from home.</p>\n\n<p>When I examined how the typical workday changed between 2019 and 2024, I saw dramatic shifts in where, when and how people worked throughout that period.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of professionals who had never worked remotely <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-workers-with-remote-friendly-jobs-are-still-working-from-home-nearly-half-the-time-5-years-after-the-pandemic-began-251758\">suddenly did so full time</a> at the height of the pandemic. Hybrid arrangements <a href=\"https://wfhresearch.com/\">have since become common</a>; many employees spend two or three days a week at home and the rest in the office.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5386372\">I found another change</a>: From 2019 to 2024, the average number of minutes worked on Fridays fell by about 90 minutes in jobs that can be done from home. That change accounts for other factors, such as a professional’s age, education and occupation. </p>\n\n<p>The decline for employees with jobs that are harder to do remotely was much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you just look at the raw data, U.S. employees with the potential to work remotely were working about 7½ hours per weekday on average in 2024, down about 13 minutes from 2019. These averages mask substantial variation between those with jobs that can more easily be done remotely and those who must report to the office most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>For example, among workers in the more remote-intensive jobs, they spent 7 hours, 6 minutes working on Fridays in 2024, but 8 hours, 24 minutes in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>That means I found, looking at the raw data, that Americans were working 78 fewer minutes on Fridays in 2024 than five years earlier. And controlling for other factors (e.g., demographics), this is actually an even larger 90-minute difference for employees who can do their jobs remotely. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, those employees were working longer hours on Wednesdays. They worked 8 hours, 24 minutes on Wednesdays in 2024, half an hour more than the 7 hours, 54 minutes logged on that day of the week in 2019. Clearly, there’s a shift from some Friday hours, with employees making up the bulk of the difference on other weekdays.</p>\n\n<h2>Fridays have long been a little different</h2>\n\n<p>Although employees are shifting some of this skipped work time to other days of the week, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4517661\">most of the reduction</a> – whether at the office or at home – has gone to leisure.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, Fridays have always been a little different than other weekdays. Many bosses allowed their staff to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/casual-friday-and-the-end-of-the-office-dress-code/484334/\">dress more casually</a> on Fridays and permitted people to depart early, long before the pandemic began. But the ability to work remotely has evidently <a href=\"https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/it-is-4pm-quitting-time\">amplified that tendency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This informal easing into the weekend, once confined to office norms, can be a morale booster. But as it has expanded, it’s become more individualized through remote and hybrid arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Those workers in remote-intensive occupations who are single, young or male reduced their working hours across the board the most, relative to 2019, although their time on the job increased a bit in 2024.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Pencils on a desk spell out TGIF, an abbreviation of thank God it's Friday.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700375/original/file-20251104-56-vwdbo6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Office workers have always been eager to get started with their weekends.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pencils-on-a-desk-arranged-to-spell-tgif-royalty-free-image/86146997?phrase=fridays&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Epoxydude/fStop via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The benefits and limits of flexibility</h2>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qju032\">a few causal studies</a> on the effects of remote work on productivity and well-being in the workplace, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01428\">including some in which I participated</a>. A general takeaway is that people tend to spend less time collaborating and more time on independent tasks when they work remotely.</p>\n\n<p>That’s fine for some professions, but in roles that depend on frequent coordination, that pattern can <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5106503\">complicate communication</a> or <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4016657\">weaken team cohesion</a>. Colocation – being physically present with your colleagues – <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4517661\">does matter for some types of tasks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But even if <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07500-2\">productivity doesn’t necessarily suffer</a>, every hour of unscheduled, independent work can be an hour not spent in coordinated effort with colleagues. That means what happens when people clock out or log off early on a Friday – whether at home or at their office – depends on the nature of their work. </p>\n\n<p>In occupations that require continuous handoffs – such as journalism, health care or customer service – <a href=\"https://staffready.com/2025/06/18/why-staggered-start-times-may-be-your-organizations-secret-weapon/\">staggered schedules can actually improve efficiency</a> by spreading coverage across more hours in the day. </p>\n\n<p>But for employees in project-based or collaborative roles that depend on overlapping hours for brainstorming, review or decision-making, uneven schedules can create friction. When colleagues are rarely online at the same time, small delays can compound and slow collective progress.</p>\n\n<p>The problem arises when flexible work becomes so individualized that it erodes shared rhythms altogether. The time-use data I analyzed suggests that remote-capable employees now spread their work more unevenly across the week, with less overlap in real time. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, that can make it harder to sustain the informal interactions and team cohesion that once happened organically when everyone left the office together at the end of the week. As some of <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4016657\">my other research</a> has shown, that also can reduce job satisfaction and increase turnover in jobs requiring greater coordination.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Businesswoman interacts with her with teammates in meeting at their office.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700374/original/file-20251104-66-k13ya1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">For many professions, team interaction is easier to have when people work at an office.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businesswoman-having-conversation-with-team-mates-royalty-free-image/2234648402?phrase=office%20work&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Morsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The future of work</h2>\n\n<p>To be sure, allowing employees to do remote work and have some scheduling flexibility on any day of the week <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm\">isn’t necessarily bad for business</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits – in terms of work-life balance, autonomy, recruitment and reducing turnover – can be very real.</p>\n\n<p>Flexible and remote arrangements expand the pool of potential applicants by freeing employers from strict geographic limits.

It seems counterintuitive that lower food access is associated with greater obesity risk. One explanation is that not having <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.1012734\">access to enough nutritious food</a> may lead people to eat a higher-fat, higher-sugar diet that includes food that’s cheap and filling but may cause them to gain weight.</p>\n\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-shutdown-brought-people-who-rely-on-snap-an-extra-helping-of-economic-hardship-112088\">temporary disruptions to the disbursement of SNAP benefits</a> can harm American kids. While the effects of brief food shortages can be hard to measure, a study on a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1994.tb00759.x\">temporary food shortage in Kenya</a> suggests that even short-term food shortages can influence both parents and their kids for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>And SNAP spending cuts, including those in what Trump called his “big beautiful bill,” are <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/snap-cuts-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-will-significantly-impair-recession-response/\">bound to hurt many children</a> whose families were relying on SNAP to get enough to eat and are now losing their benefits.</p>\n\n<p>A study by researchers from Northwestern and Princeton universities, published in 2025, followed more than 1,000 U.S. children into adulthood. It showed that food insecurity in early childhood predicted <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.1062\">higher cardiovascular risks in adulthood</a>. But those researchers also found that SNAP benefits could reduce cardiovascular risks later in life for kids facing food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Food insecurity in pregnancy is dangerous too, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14523\">not just for mothers</a>. It also <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105187\">poses risks to their babies</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Another study published in 2025 reviewed the medical records of over 19,000 pregnant U.S. women. It found that pregnant women who experience food insecurity are more likely to <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.55955\">have pregnancy-related complications</a>, such as giving birth weeks or months before their due date, developing gestational diabetes or spending extra time in the hospital, with their baby requiring a stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. </p>\n\n<p>This same study found that when pregnant women received SNAP benefits and other forms of government food assistance, they were <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.55955\">largely protected from these</a> risks tied to food insecurity. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"KdbiX\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KdbiX/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Food insecurity harms children’s mental health</h2>\n\n<p>A 2021 analysis of more than 100,000 U.S. children led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Kaiser Permanente showed that when kids experienced food insecurity sometimes or often in a 12-month period, they ran a <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054263\">50% greater risk</a> of anxiety or depression compared to kids who didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>Food insecurity in childhood is also associated with more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2009-0583\">behavior problems</a> and worse <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/135.12.2831\">academic performance</a>. These mental health, academic and behavioral problems in childhood can put people on a path toward poorer health and fewer job opportunities later on.</p>\n\n<p>Children and babies experiencing food insecurity are more likely to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-005-0036-0\">have nutrient deficiencies</a>, including insufficient iron. A review of decades of research that I participated in found that iron deficiency during infancy and early childhood, when the brain is developing quickly, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40124-014-0058-4\">can cause lasting harm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other research projects I’ve taken part in have found that iron deficiency in infancy is associated with <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/dev0001030\">cognitive deficits, not getting a high school diploma or going to college</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.12.008\">mental health problems</a> later on.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Food insecurity is often one of many sources of stress kids face</h2>\n\n<p>If a child is experiencing food insecurity, they are often dealing with other types of stress at the same time. Food insecurity is more common for children <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10796126.2014.891973\">experiencing poverty</a> and <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S1051-1377(03)00032-9\">homelessness</a>. It’s also common for kids with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-0347\">little access to health care</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Research from the research group I lead as well as other researchers have found that experiencing multiple sources of stress in childhood can harm <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3048\">mental and physical health</a>, including how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/0000413-006\">bodies manage stress</a>. These different sources of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1159/000510696\">stress often pile up</a>, contributing to health problems.</p>\n\n<p>Parents experiencing food insecurity often get stressed out because they’re scrambling to get enough food for their children. And when <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01488376.2011.607367\">parents are stressed</a> they become more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-010-0080-1\">susceptible to mental health problems</a>, and may become more likely to lose their tempers or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/lat0000203\">be physically aggressive</a> with their kids. </p>\n\n<p>In turn, when parents are stressed out, have mental health problems or develop harsh parenting styles, it’s bad for their kids. </p>\n\n<h2>SNAP falls short, even in normal times</h2>\n\n<p>To be sure, even before the <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/social-policy/explainer-understanding-snap-program-and-what-cuts\">2025 government shutdown disrupted SNAP funding</a>, its benefits <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.30\">didn’t cover the full cost</a> of feeding most families.</p>\n\n<p>Because they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.30\">fell short of what was necessary to prevent</a> food insecurity, many families with SNAP benefits needed to regularly visit food pantries and food banks – especially toward the end of the month once their benefits had been spent.</p>\n\n<p>A grocer in my rural hometown in South Dakota <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1GkqxSLsVo/\">posted on Facebook in November 2025</a> about the effects of food insecurity on families that he regularly sees. He explained that he keeps his stores open after midnight on SNAP disbursement days. Many of his customers, he said, are in a rush to get their “first real food in days.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269362/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jenalee Doom receives research funding from the National Institutes of Health. </span></em></p>",

As a family doctor, I see the common cold every day. My patients are usually skeptical when I first recommend nasal saline irrigation. However, they frequently return to tell me that this practice has changed their life. Not only does it help with upper respiratory viruses, but it also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787\">helps manage allergies</a>, chronic congestion, postnasal drip and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654\">recurrent sinus infections</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What is nasal saline irrigation?</h2>\n\n<p>Nasal saline irrigation is a process by which the nasal cavity is bathed in a saltwater solution. In some studies, this is accomplished using a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1\">pump-action spray bottle</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In others, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044\">participants used</a> a traditional <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/multimedia/neti-pot/img-20008137\">neti pot</a>, which is a vessel resembling a teapot.</p>\n\n<p>This practice of nasal irrigation originated in <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/balance/ayurvedic-treatments\">the Ayurvedic tradition</a>, which is a system of alternative medicine from India dating back more than 5,000 years.</p>\n\n<p>The neti pot can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S002221512100030X\">traced back to the 15th century</a>. It garnered mainstream interest in the U.S. in 2012 after Dr. Oz <a href=\"https://www.oprah.com/health/your-questions-answered/5\">demonstrated it on the “Oprah Winfrey Show</a>.” But it’s not the only device that has historically been employed for such purposes. Ancient Greek and Roman physicians <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S002221512100030X\">had their own nasal lavage devices</a>. Such practices were even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)83808-3\">discussed in medical journals</a> such as The Lancet over a century ago, in 1902.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"woman using a neti pot over a sink with water draining out her nostril\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701749/original/file-20251111-56-jxrwf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A neti pot is one tool for irrigating your nasal passages.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-using-a-natural-nasal-saline-irrigation-to-royalty-free-image/1772604489?phrase=ayurvedic+medicine+nasal&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">swissmediavision/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How does nasal saline irrigation work?</h2>\n\n<p>Nasal saline has a few key benefits. First, it physically flushes debris out of the nasal passage. This not only includes mucus and crust, but also the virus itself, along with allergens and other environmental contaminants.</p>\n\n<p>Second, salt water is slightly lower on the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/ph-scale-0\">pH scale</a> compared with fresh water. Its acidity creates an environment that is <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2640010/\">inhospitable for viruses</a> and makes it harder for them to replicate.</p>\n\n<p>Third, nasal saline helps restore the actions of part of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787\">our natural defense system</a>, which is composed of microscopic, hairlike projections called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/cilium\">cilia</a> that line the surface of the nasal passage. These cilia beat in a coordinated fashion to act like an escalator, propelling viruses and other foreign particles out of the body. Nasal saline irrigation helps keep this system running effectively.</p>\n\n<h2>What the research shows</h2>\n\n<p>A study of more than 11,000 people published in The Lancet in 2024 demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation, initiated at the first sign of symptoms and performed up to six times per day, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1\">reduced the duration of symptomatic illness</a> by approximately two days. Meanwhile, smaller studies have reported that the reduced duration of illness could be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y\">as high as four days</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Research has also demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation can help prevent the spread of illness. A study in hospitalized patients showed that after detection of COVID-19 via nasal swab, nasal saline irrigation performed every four hours over a 16-hour period <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y\">decreased COVID-19 viral load by 8.9%</a>. Meanwhile, the viral load in the control group continued to increase during that time.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of nasal saline also extend beyond acute infectious illnesses. When performed regularly by patients with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever\">allergic rhinitis</a>, also known as hay fever, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials showed that nasal saline irrigation can enable a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787\">62% reduction in the use of allergy medications</a>. It’s also effective for chronic congestion, postnasal drip and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654\">recurrent sinus infections</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Besides helping patients feel better faster, one of the most valuable benefits of nasal saline irrigation is that its use can help <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1\">decrease unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions</a>, which are a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis509\">major contributor to antibiotic resistance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is well established that antibiotics <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08758-y\">do not shorten the duration or reduce the severity</a> of respiratory tract infections. Despite this, studies have shown that patients are happier when they leave their doctor’s office <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00522.x\">with an antibiotic prescription in hand</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This may be why <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-1337\">10 million inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions</a> are given each year for viral respiratory tract infections. In one study of more than 49,000 patient encounters for respiratory infections, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac302\">antibiotics were unnecessarily prescribed</a> to 42.4% of patients. </p>\n\n<p>One reason patients with upper respiratory viral infections tend to initially feel better with antibiotics is because of their <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2801304/\">off-target, anti-inflammatory properties</a>. However, this benefit <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.925\">can be better achieved with anti-inflammatory medications</a> such as ibuprofen or naproxen, that can be taken in conjunction with nasal saline irrigation.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, nasal saline irrigation is a cheap, effective, evidence-based alternative that will not only shorten the duration of illness but also prevent its spread, minimize the need for unnecessary antibiotics and keep people out of the hospital.</p>\n\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dpPAfbPjjc0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Irrigating your nasal passages as soon as you feel the first signs of illness is proven to reduce the duration and severity of the common cold.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For those who want to try it, you don’t need anything fancy. Even a neti pot is not necessary. Many pharmacies sell salt water in a container with a nozzle and even spray bottles that can be refilled with a homemade saltwater solution.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll mix approximately half a teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 1 cup of water. It’s important for your safety that the water be either distilled water or boiled for at least five minutes and then cooled to destroy any harmful bacteria.

For best results, you’ll want to start irrigating the nasal passage at the first sign of an infection. You can repeat rinses throughout the day as often as needed for the duration of the illness. At minimum, you’ll want to irrigate the nasal passages every morning and evening. You can also consider gargling salt water as an adjunctive therapy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266659/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mary J.

It’s the placeholder icon for a “missing image.” </p>\n\n<p>But have you ever wondered why this scene came to be universally adopted? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/adventure-9798765101469/\">As a scholar of environmental humanities</a>, I pay attention to how symbols of wilderness appear in everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>The little mountain icon – sometimes with a sun or cloud in the background, other times crossed out or broken – has become the standard symbol, across digital platforms, to signal something missing or something to come. It appears in all sorts of contexts, and the more you look for this icon, the more you’ll see it.</p>\n\n<p>You click on it in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint when you want to add a picture. You can purchase <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/i/art-print/Broken-Internet-Image-Icon-by-TheShirtYurt/13019447.1G4ZT\">an ironic poster</a> of the icon to put on your wall. The other morning, I even noticed a version of it in my Subaru’s infotainment display as a stand-in for a radio station logo.  </p>\n\n<p>So why this particular image of the mountain peaks? And where did it come from?</p>\n\n<h2>Arriving at the same solution</h2>\n\n<p>The placeholder icon can be thought of as <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9780814742952/convergence-culture/\">a form of semiotic convergence</a>, or when a symbol ends up meaning the same thing in a variety of contexts. For example, the magnifying glass is widely understood as “search,” while the image of a leaf means “eco-friendly.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s also related to something called “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-024-00669-z\">convergent design evolution</a>,” or when organisms or cultures – even if they have little or no contact – settle on a similar shape or solution for something. </p>\n\n<p>In evolutionary biology, you can see convergent design evolution in bats, birds and insects, who all <a href=\"https://a-z-animals.com/animals/lists/animals-with-wings/\">utilize wings</a> but developed them in their own ways. Stilt houses emerged <a href=\"https://www.magicbricks.com/web-stories/variety-of-stilt-house-across-the-world/136313.html\">in various cultures across the globe</a> as a way to build durable homes along shorelines and riverbanks. More recently, engineers <a href=\"https://aiaa.org/about-aiaa/history-heritage/history-of-flight-around-the-world/\">in different parts of the world</a> designed similar airplane fuselages independent of one another. </p>\n\n<p>For whatever reason, the little mountain just worked across platforms to evoke open-ended meanings: Early web developers needed a simple shorthand way to present that something else should or could be there. </p>\n\n<p>Depending on context, a little mountain might invite a user to insert a picture in a document; it might mean that an image is trying to load, or is being uploaded; or it could mean an image is missing or broken.</p>\n\n<h2>Down the rabbit hole on a mountain</h2>\n\n<p>But of the millions of possibilities, why a mountain?</p>\n\n<p>In 1994, visual designer Marsh Chamberlain created <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CtY0WrdAtpc/?img_index=2\">a graphic featuring three  colorful shapes</a> as a stand-in for a missing image or broken link for the web browser Netscape Navigator. The shapes appeared on a piece of paper with a ripped corner. Though the paper with the rip <a href=\"https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.485923661.1240/st,small,845x845-pad,1000x1000,f8f8f8.u1.jpg\">will sometimes now appear with the mountain</a>, it isn’t clear when the square, circle and triangle became a mountain.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A generic camera dial featuring various modes, with the 'landscape mode' – represented by two little mountain peaks – highlighted.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=590&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=741&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=741&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697950/original/file-20251023-56-1l07b3.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=741&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two little mountain peaks are used to signal ‘landscape mode’ on many SLR cameras.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ModeDial.svg\">Althepal/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/141160/where-did-the-mountain-sun-image-iconography-originate\">Users on Stack Exchange</a>, a forum for developers, suggest that the mountain peak icon may trace back to the “landscape mode” icon on the dials of Japanese SLR cameras. It’s the feature that sets the aperture to maximize the depth of field so that both the foreground and background are in focus.</p>\n\n<p>The landscape scene mode – visible on many digital cameras in the 1990s – was generically represented by two mountain peaks, with the idea that the camera user would intuitively know to use this setting outdoors.</p>\n\n<p>Another insight emerged from the Stack Exchange discussion: The icon bears a resemblance to the Microsoft XP wallpaper called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(photograph)\">Bliss</a>.” If you had a PC in the years after 2001, you probably recall the rolling green hills with blue sky and wispy clouds. </p>\n\n<p>The stock photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.cizucu.com/en/magazines/2023-11-window-xp-bliss\">National Geographic photographer Charles O’Rear</a>. It was then purchased by Bill Gates’ digital licensing company Corbis in 1998. The empty hillside in this picture became iconic through its adoption by Windows XP as its default desktop wallpaper image.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A colorful stock photo of green rolling hills, a blue sky and clouds.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=482&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=606&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=606&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697957/original/file-20251023-74-3cc4ig.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=606&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">If you used a PC at the turn of the 21st century, you probably encountered ‘Bliss.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/Bliss_%28Windows_XP%29.png\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Mountain riddles</h2>\n\n<p>“Bliss” became widely understood as the most generic of generic <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/stock-photo-9798765108901/\">stock photos</a>, in the same way the placeholder icon became universally understood to mean “missing image.” And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that they both feature mountains or hills and a sky.</p>\n\n<p>Mountains and skies are mysterious and full of possibilities, even if they remain beyond grasp. </p>\n\n<p>Consider Japanese artist Hokusai’s “36 Views of Mount Fuji,” which were his series of paintings from the 1830s – the most famous of which is probably “<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/45434\">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>,” where a tiny Mount Fuji can be seen in the background. <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/57000\">Each painting</a> features the iconic mountain from different perspectives and is full of little details;

And the Japanese photography company <a href=\"https://www.fujifilm.com/us/en/consumer/digitalcameras\">Fujifilm</a> even borrowed the namesake of that mountain for their brand.</p>\n\n<p>The enticing aesthetics of mountains also reminded me of the environmental writer Gary Snyder’s 1965 translation of Han Shan’s “<a href=\"https://www.counterpointpress.com/books/riprap-and-cold-mountain-poems/\">Cold Mountain Poems</a>.” Han Shan – his name literally means “Cold Mountain” – was a Chinese Buddhist poet who lived in the late eighth century. “Shan” translates as “mountain” and is represented by the Chinese character 山, which also resembles a mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Han Shan’s poems, which are little riddles themselves, revel in the bewildering aspects of mountains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Cold Mountain is a house<br>\nWithout beams or walls.<br>\nThe six doors left and right are open<br>\nThe hall is a blue sky.<br>\nThe rooms are all vacant and vague.<br>\nThe east wall beats on the west wall<br>\nAt the center nothing.</blockquote>\n\n<h2>The mystery is the point</h2>\n\n<p>I think mountains serve as a universal representation of something unseen and longed for – whether it’s in a poem or on a sluggish internet browser – because people can see a mountain and wonder what might be there. </p>\n\n<p>The placeholder icon does what mountains have done for millennia, serving as what the environmental philosopher Margret Grebowicz describes as <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667100/mountains-and-desire-by-margret-grebowicz/\">an object of desire</a>. To Grebowicz, mountains exist as places to behold, explore and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/k2-last-problem-of-the-himalayas/554618/\">conquer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The placeholder icon’s inherent ambiguity is baked into its form: Mountains are often regarded as distant, foreboding places. At the same time, the little peaks appear in all sorts of mundane computing circumstances. The icon could even be a curious sign of how humans can’t help but be “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/william-wordsworth-and-the-romantics-anticipated-todays-idea-of-a-nature-positive-life-196129\">nature-positive</a>,” even when on computers or phones. </p>\n\n<p>This small icon holds so much, and yet it can also paradoxically mean that there is nothing to see at all. </p>\n\n<p>Viewing it this way, an example of semiotic convergence becomes a tiny allegory for digital life writ large: a wilderness of possibilities, with so much just out of reach.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268169/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher Schaberg does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Germany, Spain, Malaysia, the Czech Republic – all have substantial coal reserves and coal use today, yet they are among the <a href=\"https://poweringpastcoal.org/members/\">more than 60 countries</a> that have joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance and set phase-out deadlines between 2025 and 2040. </p>\n\n<p>Several governments in the <a href=\"https://beyondfossilfuels.org/europes-coal-exit/\">European Union</a> and <a href=\"https://poweringpastcoal.org/news/latin-america-emerges-as-a-leader-on-coal-phase-out/\">Latin America</a> are now coal phase-out leaders, and <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/total-greenhouse-gas-emission-trends\">EU greenhouse gas emissions continue to fall</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Progress, and challenges ahead</h2>\n\n<p>So, where do things stand for phasing out coal burning globally? The picture is mixed. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The accelerating deployment of renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and energy efficiency globally offer hope that global emissions are <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-new-country-climate-plans-barely-move-needle-on-expected-warming/\">on their way to peaking</a>. More than 90% of the new electricity capacity installed worldwide in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025/key-findings\">came from clean energy sources</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-electricity-demand-to-keep-growing-robustly-through-2026-despite-economic-headwinds\">energy demand is also growing quickly</a>, so new renewable power does not always replace older fossil fuel plants or prevent new ones, including coal.</p></li>\n<li><p>China now burns more coal than the rest of the world combined, and it continues to <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/chinas-construction-of-new-coal-power-plants-reached-10-year-high-in-2024/\">build new coal plants</a>. But China is also a <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/china-energy-transition-review-2025/\">driving force</a> in the dramatic growth in solar and wind energy investments and electricity generation inside China and around the world. As the industry leader in renewable energy technology, it has a strong economic interest in solar and wind power’s success around the world.</p></li>\n<li><p>While climate policies that can reduce coal use are being subject to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/glep_a_00684\">backlash politics and policy rollbacks</a> in the U.S. and several European democracies, many other governments around the world continue to enact and implement <a href=\"https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/climate-policy-strengthens-globally-despite-unprecedented-contestation-us-and-europe\">cleaner energy and emissions reduction policies</a>. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phasing out coal isn’t easy, or happening <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-countries-struggle-to-quit-fossil-fuels-despite-higher-costs-and-30-years-of-climate-talks-and-treaties-266993\">as quickly as studies show is needed</a> to slow climate change. </p>\n\n<p>To meet the 2015 Paris Agreement’s goals of limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial times, and aiming to keep warming under 1.5 C (2.7 F), research shows that the world will need to <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/\">rapidly reduce nearly all</a> fossil fuel burning and associated emissions. It is <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/climate-commitments-not-on-track-to-meet-paris-agreement-goals-as-ndc-synthesis-report-is-published\">not close to being on track</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Ensuring a just transition for coal communities</h2>\n\n<p>Many countries with coal mining operations worry about the transition for coal-dependent communities as mines shut down and jobs disappear. </p>\n\n<p>No one wants a repeat of then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s <a href=\"https://theecologist.org/2024/feb/12/unjust-transition\">destruction of British coal communities</a> in the 1980s in her effort to break the mineworkers union. Mines rapidly closed, and many coal communities and regions were left languishing in economic and social decline for decades.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two men put coal chunks into a sack with a power plant in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702367/original/file-20251113-56-4yvkae.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Two men collect coal for cooking outside the Komati Power Station, where they used to work, in 2024, in Komati, South Africa.

Shifting to renewable energy also has added benefits: It’s much <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/want-to-make-america-healthy-again-stop-fueling-climate-change-269269\">less harmful to the health</a> of those who live and work nearby than mining and burning coal is.</p>\n\n<p>There are still challenges in the transition to clean energy, but also clear ways forward.

This program supports nearly 700,000 college students per year and is often an essential way students pay their expenses and remain in school.</p>\n\n<p>The program has <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/modernizing-federal-work-study-to-support-work-based-learning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">generally garnered</a> <a href=\"https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/gillibrand-collins-announce-bipartisan-legislation-to-expand-federal-work-study-program-to-include-jobs-in-early-childhood-education/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">broad bipartisan support</a> since its creation in 1964. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the Trump administration is proposing to cut <a href=\"https://ticas.org/affordability-2/federal-budget-and-tax-policy/fy26-white-house-budget-statement-june-2-2025/#:%7E:text=Cuts%20the%20maximum%20Pell%20Grant,hourly%20wage%20to%2025%20percent.\">$980 million from work-study</a> programs. The government appropriated $1.2 billion to work study from October 2023 through September 2024. </p>\n\n<p>The government <a href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook/2024-2025/vol6/ch2-federal-work-study-program?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">typically subsidizes</a> as much as 75% of a student’s work-study earnings, though that amount can vary. Colleges and universities make up the rest. </p>\n\n<p>With no federal budget passed for fiscal year 2026 – meaning Oct. 1, 2025, through September 2026 – the future of work-study funding remains uncertain. </p>\n\n<p>In May 2025, Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\">called work study</a>  a “poorly targeted program” that is a “handout to woke universities.”</p>\n\n<p>As college enrollment experts with over 40 years of combined <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/drsamhicks/\">financial aid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coastal.edu/aboutccu/leadership/universityleadershipbios/amandacraddock/\">admissions experience</a>, we have seen how work study creates opportunities for both students and universities. We have also seen the need to change some parts of work study in order to maintain the program’s value in a shifting higher education landscape.  </p>\n\n<h2>Work study’s roots</h2>\n\n<p>Congress established <a href=\"https://undergradaid.northwestern.edu/work-study/about/history.html\">the Federal Work-Study Program</a> in 1964 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Economic-Opportunity-Act\">Economic Opportunity Act</a>, which created programs to help poor Americans by providing more education and job-training opportunities. </p>\n\n<p>Work study was one way to help colleges and universities create part-time jobs for poor students to work their way through college. </p>\n\n<p>Today, part-time and full-time undergraduate students who have applied for federal financial aid and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2015.06.006\">have unmet financial needs</a> can apply for work-study jobs. Students in these positions typically work as research assistants, campus tour guides, tutors and more. </p>\n\n<p>Students earn at least federal minimum wage – currently $7.25 an hour – in these part-time jobs, which typically take up 10 to 15 hours per week. </p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the National Center for Education Statistics <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/ssa/college-student-employment\">reported that</a> 40% of full-time and 74% of part-time undergraduate students were also employed in both work-study and non-work-study jobs. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person leans against a calculator that has a black graduation cap on top in a graphic image.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702018/original/file-20251112-56-ryv7rh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The federal government typically allocates more than $1 billion for the Federal Work-Study Program, covering about 75% of student workers’ wages.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/student-loan-calculation-education-budget-royalty-free-illustration/1365511379?phrase=college%20students%20work%20study%20jobs&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Nuthawut Somsuk/iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How work study helps students</h2>\n\n<p>Financial aid plays a critical role in a student’s ability to enroll in college, stay in school and graduate. </p>\n\n<p>Cost and lack of financial aid are the most significant barriers to higher education enrollment, according to 2024 findings by the <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/34147/Report_The_Biggest_Barriers_to_Higher_Ed_Enrollment_Are_Cost_and_Lack_of_Financial_Aid\">National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When students drop out of college because of cost, the consequences are significant both for the students and for the institutions they leave behind. </p>\n\n<p>One other key factor in student retention is the sense of belonging. <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/640609\">Research shows that students</a> who feel connected to their campus communities are more likely to succeed in staying in school. We have found that work study also helps foster a student’s sense of belonging. </p>\n\n<p>Work-study programs can also help students stay in school by offering them valuable career experience, often aligned with their academic interests.</p>\n\n<h2>Points of contention</h2>\n\n<p>Financial aid and enrollment professionals agree that <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/FWS\">work study helps</a> students who need financial aid. </p>\n\n<p>Still, some researchers have criticized the program for not meeting its intended purpose. For example, some nonpartisan <a href=\"https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/participation-federal-work-study.html\">research groups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-work-study-past-its-prime-or-ripe-for-renewal/\">think tanks</a> have noted that the average amount a student earns from work study each year – approximately $2,300 – only covers a fraction of rising tuition costs.  </p>\n\n<p>Another issue is which students get to do work study. The government gives work-study money directly to institutions, not students. As universities and colleges have broad flexibility over the program, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-work-study-past-its-prime-or-ripe-for-renewal/\">research has suggested</a> that in some cases, lower-income students are actually less likely than higher-income students to receive a work-study job.  </p>\n\n<p>Other <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/rethinking-federal-work-study-incremental-reform-not-enough\">researchers criticize</a> the lack of evidence showing work study is effective at helping students stay in school, graduate or pay their daily costs.  </p>\n\n<p>A final factor that prompts criticism is that full-time students who hold jobs <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21568235.2022.2047084\">often struggle to balance</a> juggling work, school and other important parts of their lives.</p>\n\n<h2>Areas for possible change</h2>\n\n<p>Many students who are eligible for work study don’t know that they are eligible – or don’t know how to get campus jobs. There is no standard practice of how institutions award work study to students. </p>\n\n<p>At some schools, the number of work-study jobs may be limited. If a student does not get a job, the school can reallocate the federal money to a different student. </p>\n\n<p>Another option is for schools to carry over any unused money <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/25873/Pop_Quiz_Can_Unspent_2020-21_Federal_Work-Study_FWS_Funds_be_Carried_Forward_for_Use_During_the_2021-22_Award_Year#:%7E:text=Answer:,updated%20in%20NASFAA's%20Today's%20News.\">to students in the next</a> academic year – though that doesn’t mean the same students will automatically get the money. </p>\n\n<p>We think that schools can clear up this confusion about who receives federal work-study opportunities. </p>\n\n<p>We also think that schools should explore how they are ensuring that eligible students receive work-study jobs. </p>\n\n<p>Universities and colleges could also benefit from more proactively promoting work-study opportunities. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/college-experience/2025/04/01/how-help-college-students-navigate-work-study\">University of Miami’s First Hires</a> program educates students about work study, provides personalized outreach and supports career readiness through resume development and interview preparation. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, colleges and universities could evaluate how work-study jobs align with students’ academic and career goals.</p>\n\n<p>By creating clerical and professional roles within academic departments, schools can offer students relevant work experience that makes it easier for them to find work after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>In an era of heightened scrutiny on <a href=\"https://www.aacrao.org/resources/newsletters-blogs/aacrao-connect/article/finalized-fvt-and-ge-reporting-deadlines-explained\">student outcomes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/resource-library/higher-ed-state-funding-report\">reduced public funding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/15/growing-share-of-americans-say-the-us-higher-education-system-is-headed-in-the-wrong-direction/\">growing skepticism</a> about the value of a four-year degree, we believe that universities could benefit from reimagining their financial aid strategies – especially work study.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266211/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Samantha Hicks is affiliated with the South Carolina Association of Financial Aid Administrators as current member and President-Elect and the Southern Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators as a current member and volunteer.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Amanda Craddock does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

His <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-barack-obama-election.html\">impressive grassroots campaign</a> made big promises <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\">targeted at working-class New Yorkers</a>: universal child care, rent freezes and faster, free buses. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://x.com/PollTracker2024/status/1985840648696516845\">questions remain</a> about whether Mamdani’s policies are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/the-economics-behind-zohran-mamdanis-biggest-plans-71551f5a?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\">economically</a> and <a href=\"https://time.com/7331036/mamdani-nyc-mayor-election-campaign-promises/\">practically</a> feasible. </p>\n\n<p>Critics, from <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157\">President Donald Trump</a> to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/zohran-mamdani-new-york-democrats-wary\">establishment Democrats</a>, condemned his platform as radical and unrealistic. And <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/opinion/mayor-mamdani-new-york-election.html\">The New York Times</a> warns that Mamdani risks becoming the latest “big-city civic leader promising bold, progressive change” to “mostly deliver disappointment.” Among past offenders, it lists former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. </p>\n\n<p>But the comparison to de Blasio reveals a paradox. </p>\n\n<p>As candidate for mayor in 2013, after the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/occupy-wall-street-25862\">Occupy Wall Street movement</a> against economic inequality, de Blasio campaigned on the core progressive tenet of tackling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/nyregion/despite-citys-progress-de-blasio-campaigns-on-pledge-to-lessen-inequities.html\">inequality</a> through social welfare and the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/opinion-rich-yeselson-bill-de-blasios-nyc-mayoral-election-096017\">redistribution</a> of wealth. </p>\n\n<p>De Blasio’s promises – strikingly similar to Mamdani’s – included <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/nyregion/nyc-public-preschool-system.html\">universal pre-K</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BilldeBlasio/status/1954666511538229443\">rent freezes</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/06/new-york-raises-minimum-wage-city-employees\">US$15 minimum wage</a>. De Blasio <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/bill-de-blasio-remains-unpopular.html\">delivered on all three</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So what was the “disappointment” the Times so confidently cites?</p>\n\n<p>New Yorkers today <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ6Uh8MmyNk\">remember</a> de Blasio not for his policies but for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/16/20694916/bill-de-blasio-2020-polls-eric-garner\">his persistent unpopularity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over two terms, de Blasio alienated many New Yorkers and <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2021/06/mayor-and-pariah-de-blasio-becomes-an-issue-in-the-mayoral-race/182807/\">became a pariah</a> among <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/08/09/de-blasio-is-raising-money-for-state-senate-candidates-but-does-anybody-really-want-his-help-548304\">Democratic politicians</a>. A committed progressive, he is perceived to have lost touch with the movements and communities that he hoped to lead.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the question is not whether Mamdani’s policies are realistic, but what it actually takes to win over citizens with a progressive vision. De Blasio himself cautions that it takes more than policy. <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/mamdani-de-blasio-affordability/#\">He recently said</a> that he “often mistook good policy for good politics, a classic progressive error.” </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://karshinstitute.virginia.edu/person/nicole-west-bassoff\">a scholar of public policy</a>, I think that policy achievements are neither self-evident nor self-sustaining. In my research on urban governance, I have found that it takes continuous political work to maintain local belief in urban progress and its leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Based on an analysis of de Blasio’s two terms, I have identified three key respects in which his politics fell short.</p>\n\n<h2>Keep up the ground game</h2>\n\n<p>Many accounts of de Blasio’s unpopularity emphasize his personal flaws. Open and humorous in person, he was described by critics – and even some supporters – as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/09/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-ny-mayor.html\">stubborn, didactic and self-righteous</a>. His designs on higher offices – first governor, then president – <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/opinion/2019/01/how-bill-de-blasio-seeking-the-national-spotlight-backfires/177807/\">repeatedly backfired</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But for someone elected with the support of progressives, de Blasio’s bigger problem was losing touch with local progressive politics. He missed the rise of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/the-ocasio-cortez-left-goes-to-war-with-jeff-bezos\">the anti-corporate left in Queens in 2018</a>, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – so much so that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html\">his team miscalculated</a> and agreed to place an Amazon headquarters near her district. </p>\n\n<p>And while de Blasio successfully ended his predecessor Mike Bloomberg’s <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/landmark-decision-judge-rules-nypd-stop-and-frisk-practices\">racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk policing</a> – <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/01/03/374737067/rift-between-nyc-mayor-and-police-could-become-dangerous\">feuding with the New York Police Department</a> in the process – he later alienated progressives, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-bill-de-blasio-lost-new-york-city.html\">including his own staff</a>, with his tepid response to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a coat points his finger at someone.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=453&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702051/original/file-20251112-56-m6eug4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=570&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many New Yorkers remember former Mayor Bill de Blasio for his unpopularity.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/NYCMayorsRace/0be1ca231b294b9f835b8361192dbd8f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Seth Wenig</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The contours of progressive politics can shift under one’s feet. But as a veteran of street-level politics, Mamdani has the skills to respond to, and keep shaping, the city’s progressive movement. A dynamic “ground game” – on the model of his <a href=\"https://hellgatenyc.com/zohran-mamdani-goes-the-distance/\">walk of the length of Manhattan</a> – will likely remain as important in governing as it was in campaigning.</p>\n\n<h2>Protect local autonomy</h2>\n\n<p>In New York, hostility between the city’s mayor and the governor is <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-mayor-zohran-mamdani\">a time-honored tradition</a>. De Blasio and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo famously <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2017/01/revenge-is-coming-how-everything-fell-apart-between-andrew-cuomo-and-bill-de-blasio/179033/\">took hostility to the extreme</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Early in de Blasio’s first term, while seeking state funding for universal pre-K, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/de-blasio-universal-pre-k.html\">de Blasio angered Cuomo by insisting on</a> funding it through a tax on the city’s wealthy. Lacking necessary state approval, de Blasio eventually accepted a different state funding source. Universal pre-K became de Blasio’s cornerstone achievement, but the lasting feud with Cuomo remained a problem, even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/cuomo-coronavirus-orthodox-shutdown.html\">compromising the city’s plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Critics also thought de Blasio could have been tougher on Big Tech. Letting a <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/google-is-transforming-nycs-payphones-into-a-personalized-propaganda-engine/\">Google-backed</a> consortium run the city’s free Wi-Fi program without meaningful oversight left the city with a <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/press-release/nyclu-citys-public-wi-fi-raises-privacy-concerns\">privacy scandal</a> and <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/linknyc-vendors-owe-nyc-millions-dollars-city-official-says\">serious financial deficits</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In trying to attract Amazon’s headquarters, de Blasio’s administration offended New Yorkers’ sensibilities by allowing the company to <a href=\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&amp;context=lg_pubs\">bypass local development review processes</a>. Though famously byzantine, these processes were created to ensure <a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2020/1/22/21073049/nyc-zoning-ulurp-land-use-review-city-council\">local control over development decisions</a>. One could not simply bulldoze them aside. </p>\n\n<p>In another case, and to his credit, de Blasio was quick to see the need to regulate Uber’s explosive growth, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/nyregion/uber-vote-city-council-cap.html\">it took years to overcome</a> the company’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/07/uber-rewrites-the-book-on-beating-de-blasio-025110\">aggressive opposition campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Though some progressives wish <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vksfr\">mayors ruled the world</a>, U.S. cities have traditionally depended on states, the federal government and private companies for capital and resources. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439251348175\">As I</a> and <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/city-power-9780190246662?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">others</a> have shown, and de Blasio’s experiences attest, these outside players can undermine the progressive ideal of a city that seeks to redistribute economic benefit. </p>\n\n<p>Mayoral powers are limited, but Mamdani can use his popularity to protect New York City’s capacity for self-government from outside interference, while cooperating strategically with the state when necessary. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s endorsement of Mamdani, <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/10/mamdani-hochul-universal-child-care-new-york/\">driven by a shared interest in universal child care</a>, was a start. United, they stand a better chance of defending local – city and state – autonomy against <a href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2025/10/14/president-trump-renews-his-attacks-on-zohran-mamdani-and-his-threats-against-new-york-city\">threats from President Donald Trump</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, there is <a href=\"https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1228&amp;context=reports\">little evidence</a> that it pays for cities to court private businesses with expensive incentives – a common but contested city practice. Instead, <a href=\"https://teamster.org/2024/10/teamsters-mayor-breed-and-california-leaders-rally-to-demand-amazon-recognize-union/\">following mayors elsewhere</a>, Mamdani might pressure tech companies to end union-busting practices and thereby ensure local workers’ right to organize.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Several people gather to watch a screen.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702053/original/file-20251112-56-ogkkwa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Supporters for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani watch returns during election night, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/APTOPIXElection2025MayorNewYork/9c979f524bb5461285379a24d37c0392/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lead with the social compact</h2>\n\n<p>Though de Blasio delivered many progressive policies, he was unable to keep alive his campaign promise to end New York’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_zMTrhgAw\">tale of two cities</a>” – the stark divide between extreme wealth and poverty.</p>\n\n<p>A major, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/01/de-blasio-says-homelessness-was-biggest-failure/\">self-admitted</a> failure was on homelessness, especially among <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/de-blasio-report-card-inequity.html\">single adults</a>. Homelessness among this group grew despite increased spending on <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/mugged-by-reality-on-homelessness\">homeless services</a>, creating the impression that de Blasio was insufficiently concerned with <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2021/12/27/de-blasio-promised-to-fix-nycs-tale-of-two-cities-but-critics-say-he-failed-when-it-came-to-housing-and-the-homeless/\">the welfare of his city’s most beleaguered residents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Such inconsistencies loomed large in the public discussion. Over time, de Blasio’s administration could no longer convince the public that its energies were being channeled toward a coherent vision of progress. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that urban governance is about clarifying the rights and responsibilities that urban residents can expect to have, what I think of as the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.mainelaw.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1551&amp;context=mlr\">social compact</a> between the city and its subjects. De Blasio’s growing unpopularity weakened his ability to show that his policy achievements amounted to upholding a tacit progressive promise to guarantee basic economic rights for all.</p>\n\n<p>Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, father of losing mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/postscript-mario-cuomo\">often said</a>: “You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.” While campaigning, Mamdani offered a poetic vision for a new social compact in New York. </p>\n\n<p>“City government’s job,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/mamdani-cuomo-free-city-services.html\">he has said</a>, “is to make sure each New Yorker has a dignified life, not determine which New Yorkers are worthy of that dignity.” </p>\n\n<p>Many commentators insist that Mamdani must now abandon poetry and deliver the policy. But that is only partly right. </p>\n\n<p>New Yorkers will disagree about the details, but the election results suggest that they want to believe in the promise of a dignified life for all. Mamdani’s ability to lead New York City – and a wider post-Trump progressive movement – will be a matter of setting an example in rearticulating and reaffirming what that promise means, to him and to his city.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269062/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nicole West Bassoff does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

More than half of them are <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/manufacturing/news/program/2024/what-is-driving-the-demand-for-distribution-transformers\">over 33 years old</a> – approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.</p>\n\n<p>Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/4-years-into-a-difficult-transformers-market-in-the-us-is-there-a-potential-end-in-sight/\">four to six times what they cost before 2022</a>, in addition to the multiyear wait times.</p>\n\n<p>To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them – <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/manufacturing/news/program/2024/what-is-driving-the-demand-for-distribution-transformers\">perhaps twice as many as already exist</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person drives a forklift near a group of large metal canisters.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702079/original/file-20251112-56-rofieq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Even smaller transformers like these are in high demand and short supply.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/SuperstormSandy/6b24d9bb11c54c96b5f1fce9c1455fdc/photo\">AP Photo/Mel Evans</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SRA_2025.pdf\">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a> says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks – more than two years – in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks – up to four years. Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are <a href=\"https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87653.pdf\">back-ordered as much as two years</a>. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.</p>\n\n<p>Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use <a href=\"https://www.thyssenkrupp-steel.com/en/products/electrical-steel/electrical-steel-grain-oriented/electrical-steel-grain-oriented.html\">grain-oriented electrical steel</a>, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by <a href=\"https://www.qualitrolcorp.com/resource-library/advancing-the-grid/chokeholds-supply-chain/\">Cleveland-Cliffs</a> at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/transformer-troubles-manufacturing-and-policy-constraints-hit-us-transformer-supply/\">80% of large transformers</a> have historically been imported from Mexico, China and Thailand. But <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/power-transformers-and-distribution-transformers-will-face-supply-deficits-of-30-and-10-in-2025/\">global demand has also surged</a>, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.</p>\n\n<p>In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy <a href=\"https://www.nema.org/news-trends/view/nema-responds-to-department-of-energy-s-final-distribution-transformer-efficiency-rule\">delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules</a> for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.</p>\n\n<p>Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be <a href=\"https://metapowersolutions.com/transformer-efficiency-standards-compliance-guide/\">designed, tested and certified individually</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport – sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable <a href=\"https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/what-is-a-schnabel-car/\">super-heavy-load railcars</a> in the country.

A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that <a href=\"https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/rethinking-load-growth.pdf\">high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times</a> reached about 151 weeks – nearly three years – by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.</p>\n\n<p>Facing similar delays are a <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SRA_2025.pdf\">range of equipment types</a>, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear – a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers and fuses – and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can <a href=\"https://www.offshore-mag.com/renewable-energy/article/55240474/shortage-of-submarine-power-cables-poses-threat-to-offshore-wind-market\">take more than a decade to fill</a>. And fewer than <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/subsea-cables/\">50 cable-laying vessels</a> operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.</p>\n\n<p>Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova have multiyear backlogs as <a href=\"https://www.nrucfc.coop/content/solutions/en/stories/energy-tech/turbine-trouble--why-power-projects-are-facing-delays.html\">new data centers, industrial electrification and peaking-capacity projects</a> flood the order books.

In addition to <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-finalizes-distribution-transformer-rule/712229/\">delaying transformer efficiency requirements</a>, the Biden administration awarded <a href=\"https://www.journal-news.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-turns-back-on-500m-federal-grant-to-upgrade-middletown-plant/6OP4U3CNARDXTBECITPPUT6TFM/\">Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million</a> to upgrade its electrical-steel plants – but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p>Utilities and industry groups are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-29/how-a-shortage-of-transformers-threatens-electricity-supply\">exploring standardized designs and modular substations</a> to cut lead times – but acknowledge that those are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-29/how-a-shortage-of-transformers-threatens-electricity-supply\">medium-term fixes</a>, not quick solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Large government incentives, including grants, loans and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing. Until the underlying supply-chain choke points – steel, copper, insulation materials and heavy transport – expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction, but through choreography.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269448/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kyri Baker receives funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and The Climate Innovation Collaboratory.

In a dimly lit recess in the library hangs the 1899 class portrait. Its year is incorrectly labeled as 1898, and the students are left unnamed. </p>\n\n<p>In the photo, 20 men stand. Only one of them is Black. I can tell you that he was <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/law/highlighting-black-students-colorado-law-1896-1968#franklin-l.-anderson-(ex-1899)\">Franklin LaVeale Anderson</a>, a successful Boulder, Colorado businessman and landowner who entered the law school in 1896 as the university’s first known Black student. </p>\n\n<p>But until recently, people working or studying at the university knew little of his story.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not much different for subsequent Black law students, whose names and accomplishments also remain largely unknown to the Colorado Law community. Many of the earliest Black students’ portraits are in the back of the basement. Their accomplishments were known by their families and their communities, but their former law school had done little to record these individuals who are part of its history.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in 2024, inspired by an <a href=\"https://lawmagazine.bc.edu/2024/07/a-history-of-black-graduates-at-bc-law/\">article published by Boston College Law School</a>, Colorado Law decided to explore its own Black history. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/law/node/12579/rebecca-ciota\">librarian with more than nine years of professional experience</a> in academic settings – and I never shy away from challenging research questions. I agreed to take on the project.</p>\n\n<h2>Searching the archives</h2>\n\n<p>Like Anderson, most of the Black alumni prior to 1968 were unknown to current law school staff who were hired after they graduated.</p>\n\n<p>Due to <a href=\"https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa\">student privacy regulations</a> as well as <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/glorycoloradohis0000davi\">a lack of demographic data prior to 1970</a>, there is no easy way of identifying all students of a certain ethnic or racial background. So my research project began with those old class portraits hanging throughout the school.</p>\n\n<p>I spent several hours squinting in dark corners and climbing onto study tables to find photographs and record class years. It was an imperfect science: Some of the class photos were missing, and not all students were photographed. In the end, I identified more than 210 Black students who had attended Colorado Law from 1899 to 2024.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large brick building with blue skies and clouds in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702345/original/file-20251113-56-vwc47k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Portraits of University of Colorado Law School students and classes line the hallways of the school.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Courtesy of the University of Colorado Law School.</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Among them was Franklin LaVeale Anderson.

The Heritage Center has also done research on Black students from 1896 through the 1920s. </p>\n\n<p>At this point of the research process, I had many names, biographical information and some context about the presence of marginalized groups at the university. I still needed more biographical information, so I began searching beyond the university.</p>\n\n<h2>The search continued</h2>\n\n<p>First, I collected genealogical information – birth and death dates, marriage certificates and places of residence – from <a href=\"https://www.familysearch.org/en/united-states/\">FamilySearch</a>, a subsidiary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I chose FamilySearch because it provides resources similar to the better-known Ancestry.com, but for free. </p>\n\n<p>The genealogical information began to tell a story.</p>\n\n<p>I learned that Anderson, the university’s first known Black student, <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/law/highlighting-black-students-colorado-law-1896-1968#franklin-l.-anderson-(ex-1899)\">was born a free person in Missouri</a> in 1859 while slavery was legal in Missouri. He took up barbering while still in Missouri. He moved to Minnesota at the age of 26 and married his first wife there. The couple moved to Boulder in 1892, where they purchased multiple lots in town. Anderson continued his work as a barber. Around 1900, he spent a few years in Fort Morgan and then moved to Sheridan, Wyoming, before settling in Los Angeles. He died there in 1918.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I searched historical newspapers, primarily the <a href=\"https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/\">Colorado Historic Newspapers</a> collection, in hopes of finding more details about Colorado Law’s Black students. The student newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/cmdinow/buffs-journalism-1892-today#:%7E:text=University%20of%20Colorado's%20first%20student%20publication%20launches,first%20issue%2C%20published%20in%201892.\">The Silver &amp; Gold</a>, revealed that Anderson joined his classmates for a <a href=\"https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=SAG18990407-01.2.7\">party at law professor William A.

At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.</p>\n\n<p>But as a <a href=\"https://americanstudies.nd.edu/faculty/thomas-tweed/\">historian of religion</a>, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.</p>\n\n<p>Communal rituals of giving thanks <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/thanksgiving/history\">have a longer history</a> in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/45367\">emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing</a> and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.</p>\n\n<h2>Farming faiths and harvest festivals</h2>\n\n<p>The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mashpeewampanoagtribe-nsn.gov/\">The Wampanoag</a>, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the <a href=\"https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/resources/Cranberry-Day\">cranberry harvest</a>, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.</p>\n\n<p>As I note in my 2025 book, “<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300221480/religion-in-the-lands-that-became-america/\">Religion in the Lands That Became America</a>,” for instance, celebrants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/2694566\">gathered for a communal feast</a> in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cahokian-culture-spread-across-eastern-north-america-1-000-years-ago-in-an-early-example-of-diaspora-130106\">That Native city</a>, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An overhead view of a grassy green area with several raised mounds.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700696/original/file-20251106-56-wreyf5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The St. Louis, Mo., skyline is seen beyond Monks Mound at Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Collinsville, Ill., on July 11, 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-st-louis-skyline-is-seen-on-the-horizon-beyond-monks-news-photo/1161853230?adppopup=true\">Daniel Acker for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Cahokians and their neighbors <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/2694566\">came in late summer or early autumn</a> to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.</p>\n\n<h2>‘Days of Thanksgiving’</h2>\n\n<p>The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants. </p>\n\n<p>The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-first-pilgrims-and-the-puritans-differed-in-their-views-on-religion-and-respect-for-native-americans-240974\">Catholic elements</a> that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-pilgrims-before-plymouth-111851259/\">church and community in Holland</a>. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-england-soul-9780199890972?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">historians have noted</a>, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief. </p>\n\n<p>The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress <a href=\"https://1777.org/first-national-thanksgiving/\">declared a Day of Thanksgiving</a> to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/july-9-1812-proclamation-day-fasting-and-prayer\">announced Days of Thanksgiving</a> during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states <a href=\"https://pilgrimhall.org/pdf/TG_Presidential_Thanksgiving_Proclamations_1862_1869.pdf\">did the same</a> during the Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>This tradition influenced Americans such as <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mal.2669900/?st=grid\">Sarah Hale</a>, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “<a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/sarah-hale\">Mary Had a Little Lamb</a>,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvest feast of 1621</h2>\n\n<p>Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in <a href=\"https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/thanksgiving/sq1ss1.html#gallery02\">a Jean Ferris painting</a> by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to <a href=\"https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/jennie-augusta-brownscombe/the-first-thanksgiving-at-plymouth-1914/\">another popular image</a> painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A painting in muted colors of a small group of people in plain clothing seated around a table outside, with a log cabin in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=375&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700693/original/file-20251106-76-8voq8h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=471&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A.

The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees. </p>\n\n<p>Only one <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/a09810.0001.001\">eyewitness account</a> survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-edward-winslow-plymouth-hero-thanksgiving-180961174/\">Edward Winslow</a>. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300227024/the-saltwater-frontier/\">historians suggest</a>, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.</p>\n\n<p>Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-edward-winslow-plymouth-hero-thanksgiving-180961174/\">as Winslow recalled</a> – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/mayflower-400-a-deep-dive-into-american-thanksgiving-1.5807974/thanksgiving-squanto-true-story-marked-by-slavery-and-treachery-says-historian-1.5807979\">the lone survivor</a> of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3201/edi1602.090276\">a regional epidemic</a> that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.</p>\n\n<h2>Pilgrims’ primacy</h2>\n\n<p>The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/01733.05p658.pdf\">1863 proclamation</a>, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/01733.05p776-777.pdf\">illustrated follow-up</a>. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-thanksgiving-south-history-20171223-story.html\">many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving</a>, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Several small black-and-white illustrations around a larger one of a woman with long hair and a star headdress kneeling in prayer.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1057&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1057&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700692/original/file-20251106-56-5158jg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1057&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">This ‘Thanksgiving Day’ illustration, made by cartoonist Thomas Nast, commemorated its first celebration as a U.S. holiday.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://onlinecollections.syr.edu/objects/41379/thanksgiving-day-november-26-1863\">Syracuse University Art Museum</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had <a href=\"https://dos.fl.gov/historical/explore/el-camino-real/places-to-go/st-augustine/\">founded St. Augustine</a> in 1565. According to <a href=\"https://floridapress.org/9780813068428/pedro-menendez-de-aviles-and-the-conquest-of-florida/\">an eyewitness account</a>, the Spanish leader asked a priest to <a href=\"https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/163971\">celebrate Mass</a> on Sept. 8, 1565, <a href=\"https://floridapress.org/9780813007762/the-cross-in-the-sand/\">which Native Americans attended</a>, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”</p>\n\n<p>Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300190397/american-judaism/\">Jewish engineer</a>. The English had more success when they <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/a-short-history-of-jamestown.htm\">settled Jamestown, Virginia</a>, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “<a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/f8d2c580-b9e7-0132-86ac-58d385a7bbd0?canvasIndex=0\">a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God</a>” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.</p>\n\n<p>But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674238510\">toward the center of the national holiday</a> – and America’s founding narrative.</p>\n\n<p>In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster <a href=\"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/danielwebsterplymouthorationcomplete.htm\">gave a speech</a> commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “<a href=\"https://ia601302.us.archive.org/32/items/chroniclesofpilg00young/chroniclesofpilg00young.pdf\">Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers</a>,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”</p>\n\n<h2>Rising immigration</h2>\n\n<p>Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/immigrant-population-over-time\">the peak of immigration to the U.S.</a>, and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration in faded colors of a group of men and women standing, a bit disoriented, on a hill beside the ocean.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=463&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701537/original/file-20251110-56-7r4qkv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=582&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A late-1800s depiction of the Plymouth landing, published by the printmaking business Currier and Ives.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/45367\">Mabel Brady Garvan Collection/Yale University Art Gallery</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Irish Catholics already <a href=\"https://globalboston.bc.edu/index.php/home/eras-of-migration/first-wave/\">had a presence in Boston</a> when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population <a href=\"https://globalboston.bc.edu/index.php/home/eras-of-migration/second-wave/\">increased further</a> as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.</p>\n\n<p>The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/33039235/\">Our Country</a>,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”</p>\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300221480/religion-in-the-lands-that-became-america/\">300th anniversary</a> of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/about-us-stamps-bureau-period-1894-1939-commemorative-issues-1898-1925/pilgrim\">commemorative stamps</a> <a href=\"https://www.money.org/1920-1921-pilgrim-tercentenary-half-dollar/\">and coins</a>. Officials <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.thepilgrimspirit00sawy/?st=pdf\">staged pageants</a>, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear <a href=\"https://pplma.omeka.net/exhibits/show/president-day---august-21--192\">President Warren Harding</a> and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”</p>\n\n<p>Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act\">Immigration Act of 1924</a>, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades. </p>\n\n<p>Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy <a href=\"https://www.lbjlibrary.org/news-and-press/media-kits/immigration-and-nationality-act\">became more welcoming in 1965</a>, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s <a href=\"https://america250.org/\">250th anniversary</a>. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267944/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Thomas Tweed does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

As China continues to invest in expensive space capabilities, it will also likely become increasingly sensitive to losing them. The rise in space debris may create incentives for Chinese officials to cooperate with the United States on measures that reduce the risk of collisions.</p>\n\n<h2>Space debris – a growing issue</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aerospace.org/article/space-debris-101\">Space debris</a> is creating growing problems for space operations. It includes any artificial objects  in orbit not operating as satellites or spacecraft. It ranges in size from a fleck of paint to large rocket bodies roughly the size of a school bus. </p>\n\n<p>In the most commonly used orbit – <a href=\"https://www.space.com/low-earth-orbit\">low Earth orbit</a> – this debris can move at speeds of roughly 18,000 mph, almost <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/headquarters/library/find/bibliographies/space-debris/\">seven times the speed of a bullet</a>. At such high speeds, even tiny pieces of space debris can be highly destructive, to the point that this debris might continue to multiply until one day it makes certain critical orbits unusable. When space debris collides with other objects and fragments, they can break into smaller pieces, <a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/\">generating even more debris</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s somewhat ironic that China’s spacecraft took a hit from space junk. The country is responsible for creating the <a href=\"https://www.cna.org/archive/CNA_Files/pdf/chinas-role-in-making-outer-space-more.pdf\">majority of space debris</a>. In 2007, China blew up a defunct Fengyun-1c weather satellite to test an anti-satellite weapon. It generated the <a href=\"https://www.swfound.org/publications-and-reports/chinese-direct-ascent-anti-satellite-testing-fact-sheet\">most space debris in history</a> – over 3,000 pieces are still orbiting today. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zoQmV3PGNc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">This short clip shows the increase in space debris in orbit around Earth.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>On several occasions, the International Space Station has had to maneuver to narrowly avoid being struck by debris from this test, including as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-chunk-of-chinese-satellite-almost-hit-the-international-space-station-they-dodged-it-but-the-space-junk-problem-is-getting-worse-171735\">recently as 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Anti-satellite weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Why would China, or any other country, want to develop an anti-satellite weapon? Satellites provide significant <a href=\"https://www.aerospacedefensereview.com/news/the-strategic-importance-of-military-satellites-nwid-1852.html\">benefits to militaries</a>. They help with reconnaissance and intelligence, allow for the precise targeting and guidance of long-range munitions, support communication over large distances and supply weather data, to name just a few uses. </p>\n\n<p>These advantages were showcased during the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war\">first Gulf War</a>, often called the “<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gps-and-the-world-s-first-space-war/\">first space war</a>.” The United States used space technologies to quickly and decisively defeat the Iraqi military within weeks, and with far fewer casualties than expected. The Gulf War had a profound impact on Chinese military thinking, with analysts in the People’s Liberation Army <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-new-military-strategy-winning-informationized-local-wars\">recognizing the importance</a> of space technologies in modern warfare. </p>\n\n<p>Whereas the United States has been and remains highly dependent on space capabilities, China has historically been less dependent on them. This means that China has traditionally had far less to lose from striking satellites in orbit and comparatively more to gain from disabling an adversary’s satellites. </p>\n\n<p>Since the 1990s, China has <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/04/how-china-expanding-its-anti-satellite-arsenal/404283/\">invested in technologies</a> that can jam, disable or outright destroy another country’s satellites. This effort has been driven by a desire to counter what it sees as a key vulnerability of the U.S. military – its heavy reliance on space capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Yet much has changed since China’s first anti-satellite test in 2007. </p>\n\n<p>China has gradually narrowed the gap with the United States in space capabilities and is now one of the most powerful spacefaring nations on Earth. As a result, China now has more at stake if it were to lose access to space. </p>\n\n<p>Space debris is becoming a serious threat to Chinese interests in space. In 2022, for example, reports emerged that debris from Russia’s 2021 ASAT test came dangerously <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/chinese-satellite-in-near-miss-with-russian-asat-test-debris/\">close to a Chinese satellite</a>. Similarly, in 2021 China filed a claim at the United Nations that China’s Tiangong space station had to perform avoidance maneuvers due to “<a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2021/aac_105/aac_1051262_0_html/AAC105_1262E.pdf\">close encounters</a>” with Starlink satellites. And now, in November 2025, China’s Shenzhou-20 spacecraft has actually been struck by space debris.</p>\n\n<h2>Recognizing the problem</h2>\n\n<p>It is too early to gauge how seriously Chinese officials view the threat of space debris. However, the high-profile nature of this recent incident may alert China’s public and officials to the risks posed by space debris. </p>\n\n<p>China’s space station, its astronauts and its satellites are <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/power-of-the-space-club/B26F1CB83AF8DB49CCFF2C3B7723A2EA\">important to the Chinese Communist Party</a>. If space debris permanently destroyed parts or all of China’s space station, or even killed a Chinese astronaut, it would likely lead to significant public outcry.</p>\n\n<p>China’s space station is a project over three decades in the making and is the crown jewel of its space program. The Tiangong is set to become the only space station in orbit if the United States proceeds with its plans to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/\">deorbit the ISS</a> in 2030. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A space station, which looks like several connected cylinders with solar panels coming off them, orbiting the planet Earth.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701973/original/file-20251112-66-6d641u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An illustration of China’s Tiangong space station.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/chinese-space-station-orbiting-the-planet-earth-on-royalty-free-image/1164146039?phrase=tiangong%20Alejomiranda&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">alejomiranda/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Just as an owner of an expensive Lamborghini may become increasingly worried about dangerous road conditions that may damage their prized possession, Chinese officials may become anxious about China’s ability to operate its space station should space junk continue to clutter low Earth orbit.</p>\n\n<p>Even if space debris does not damage China’s space station, it still poses a risk to Chinese satellites.

This is called home appraisal bias.</p>\n\n<p>An appraisal represents an expert opinion <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2023-06/understanding-appraisals-and-why-they-matter\">of the value of a home</a>. It is determined by a licensed professional who applies industry standard rules and practices.</p>\n\n<p>The appraisal is critical to securing a mortgage to purchase a home or to refinancing an existing mortgage. It can determine whether an applicant gets a mortgage and influence how much the mortgage costs. For example, if a borrower must take out a mortgage for more than 80% of a property’s value, they may be required to pay for private mortgage insurance in some cases. Getting the appraisal value right is key to ensuring that homebuyers and those seeking to refinance a mortgage can do so under fair and equal conditions.</p>\n\n<p>We are two academics who study <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C22&amp;q=ira+goldstein+philadelphia&amp;oq=Ira+Goldstein+\">urban places</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kiThOLQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">the people who live in them</a>. Together, we have more than 80 years of experience working at federal civil rights agencies, teaching at research universities and consulting for the housing industry, city and state agencies, and nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently we have been working with Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker on a plan to <a href=\"https://www.reinvestment.com/insights/philadelphia-home-appraisal-bias-task-force-report-and-recommendations/\">reduce racial bias in home appraisals in Philly</a>.  </p>\n\n<h2>Fair Housing Act of 1968</h2>\n\n<p>In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter45&amp;edition=prelim\">Fair Housing Act</a>, which made it unlawful to deny housing based on race, color, religion or national origin. Congress added sex in 1974 and handicap and familial status in 1988. </p>\n\n<p>The Fair Housing Act was passed just seven days <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/fair-housing-act-fifty-years-later\">after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and two months after the release of the <a href=\"https://belonging.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/kerner_commission_full_report.pdf?file=1&amp;force=1\">Kerner Commission report</a>. This federal report examined the causes of racial violence in the U.S. in the 1960s and concluded, “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.”   </p>\n\n<p>Passage of the Fair Housing Act did not end housing discrimination. But over the years, <a href=\"https://s4.ad.brown.edu/Projects/Diversity/Data/Report/report08122021.pdf\">residential segregation has declined slowly</a>, and the most egregious and overt discriminatory acts, such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/03/archives/cross-burned-at-another-li-home.html\">cross burnings and blockbusting</a>, rarely happen anymore. </p>\n\n<p>In recent years, attention has focused on racial disparities in home valuation established by appraisals. This reflects, in part, some high-profile, public allegations of racial bias in appraising revealed through homeowners’ “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/couple-faced-discrimination-home-appraisal-wifes-%20race/story?id=73203432\">whitewashing” of their homes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Whitewashing describes how a Black homeowner who receives a low appraisal removes all signs that a Black person lives in a home, replaces family photos with photos of white people, and has a white friend at home when a second appraiser arrives, giving the impression that it is the home of a white family. Bias is revealed when the second appraisal produces a higher value than the first. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm\">94% of appraisers and assessors in the U.S. are white</a> may be a contributing factor. </p>\n\n<p>Appraisal discrimination is unfair, contributes to racial wealth disparities and violates the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"mQSxU\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mQSxU/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Home appraisal bias is a national issue</h2>\n\n<p>Multiple studies establish that homes in Black and brown neighborhoods across the U.S., all else equal, are <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018.11_Brookings-Metro_Devaluation-Assets-Black-Neighborhoods_final.pdf\">valued less than comparable homes in white neighborhoods</a>. Appraisal bias is just one factor in this, as are historical and contemporary <a href=\"https://controller.phila.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/redlining_report-1.pdf\">redlining</a> and real estate practices, individual choices and other factors. </p>\n\n<p>One way to identify appraisal discrimination would be to compare how often appraisals are below agreed-upon sale prices in nonwhite neighborhoods compared to white neighborhoods. Our research has documented that <a href=\"https://www.fhfa.gov/document/wp2406.pdf\">appraisals themselves</a> are sometimes <a href=\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/33c9b1a8/files/uploaded/Home-Appraisals-in-Black-and-White_Final_10.21.24.pdf\">biased representations of home values</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Nationally, the percentage of appraisals below the sale price is <a href=\"https://www.fhfa.gov/data/dashboard/uad-aggregate-statistics-dashboard-portal\">substantially greater in nonwhite neighborhoods</a> than in white neighborhoods. There is no apparent reason that appraisals should be systematically higher or lower than sale prices in nonwhite or white neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<h2>It’s a Philly issue too</h2>\n\n<p>Appraisal bias also persists in Philadelphia, as we’ve demonstrated in our own analyses using the <a href=\"https://www.reinvestment.com/insights/examining-evidence-of-racial-equality-in-home-appraising-in-the-philadelphia-metropolitan-area/\">Federal Housing Finance Agency’s uniform appraisal dataset</a>, or UAD.</p>\n\n<p>The UAD is the only neighborhood-level source of information on home appraisal activity. However, the dataset reports less than half of census tracts in Philadelphia because the FHFA often suppresses data due to privacy concerns. In tracts with few transactions, reporting the data could identify individual homeowners.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, we employed a different approach <a href=\"https://www.illinoisrealtors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8.5x11_ColorAndCollateralStudy_2021.pdf\">using 2021-24 lending data</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/\">Home Mortgage Disclosure Act</a>. HMDA is an annually released federal database containing detailed information on most mortgage applications in the U.S. The data includes race, mortgage characteristics, property value, location and other details.</p>\n\n<p>We wanted to understand whether there was a pattern of denied applications for cash-out refinance mortgages where the lender’s single reason for denial was collateral, which is generally established by the appraisal. Cash-out refinance mortgages are loans that pay off the homeowner’s existing loan and allow that homeowner to additionally borrow some of the equity they have in their home. </p>\n\n<p>Our study shows that it was substantially more frequent that collateral was the single reason for that denial in nonwhite neighborhoods and for nonwhite homeowners. </p>\n\n<p>This was the case whether the homeowner was seeking a conventional mortgage or a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA borrowers frequently have lower credit or a lower down payment than a conventional borrower and pay an insurance fee that compensates for the higher risk they represent.  </p>\n\n<p>These two Philadelphia-based studies used different methodologies to arrive at the same conclusion, which we shared in a September 2025 report for the nonprofit Reinvestment Fund, where one of us is a senior adviser. That conclusion is this: Whether you want to buy a home or access the stored wealth in the home you already own in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.reinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Reinvestment-Fund_Appraisal-Brief_PHL-2025.pdf\">you are disadvantaged in the valuing of the real estate</a> if you are a person of color or if the home is located in a mostly Black or Hispanic neighborhood.</p>\n\n<h2>Possible solutions</h2>\n\n<p>Remedies are available, but in the current political climate the burden is increasingly on local governments, nonprofit advocacy groups and industry actors rather than the federal government.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More transparency:</strong> The home appraisal industry is opaque. While the uniform appraisal dataset provides some insight into appraisal bias, much of its data <a href=\"https://www.reinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Reinvestment-Fund_Appraisal-Brief_PHL-2025.pdf\">is not public</a>. Further, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has not included neighborhood-level appraisal data for Federal Housing Administration transactions. </p>\n\n<p>A national database of appraisals, similar to the HMDA database for loan applications, would improve transparency and accountability. While the HMDA did not eliminate lending discrimination, it is a <a href=\"https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/research-and-policy/too-big-to-hide-the-importance-of-public-data-on-the-mortgage-market/\">valuable tool to uncover and address discrimination</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Get informed:</strong> A fair appraisal ensures that homeowners have an independent, accurate, expert opinion of the value of their home. But homeowners must understand how that opinion was derived and how they can contest that opinion of value when appropriate. Some lenders now allow an owner to get a second opinion if the owner feels the appraised value is inaccurate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raise public awareness:</strong> Local officials can inform the public about the nuts and bolts of appraisals and outline what can be done when bias occurs. Philadelphia is taking steps. The city’s <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/programs/home-appraisal-bias-program/\">Home Appraisal Bias Program</a> is working to <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/philly-launches-program-to-reduce-home-appraisal-disparities\">increase diversity of local appraisers</a>, enhance appraisal transparency and educate consumers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>File a complaint:</strong> HUD has substantially pulled back from combating appraisal bias, including <a href=\"https://x.com/HUDgov/status/1943412466416750973\">disbanding the Biden-era PAVE Task Force</a>, which was making progress on the issue. The Trump administration has further impaired enforcement of the Fair Housing Act through layoffs and the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/resource/hud-sends-disparate-impact-rule-changes-omb\">withdrawal of critical policies</a> long found to be effective in fighting housing discrimination. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, those who believe they have been subjected to appraisal bias can file complaints with HUD or their state or local fair housing agencies. This will at least create a record of the frequency of the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Given the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-shutdown-and-the-houses-inaction-helps-pave-congress-path-to-irrelevance-268536\">reduced role of the federal government</a> today, there is an extra burden on state and local civil rights agencies and nonprofits to ensure alleged violations are investigated and, when appropriate, prosecuted.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268479/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

What’s their history, and how do they affect a drug’s use?</p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/\">clinical pharmacologist and pharmacist</a> studying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280241277551\">drug prescribing</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626\">safety</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.2045\">effectiveness</a> for over 25 years. </p>\n\n<p>Black box warnings – or as the FDA officially calls them, boxed warnings – are a tool for alerting pharmacists and clinicians that the medication may have serious risks. These health care professionals are then expected to communicate those risks to consumers.  </p>\n\n<h2>An official source of drug information</h2>\n\n<p>Black box warnings for particular medications appear on the product package inserts that the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to create for each prescription drug.</p>\n\n<p>Product package inserts provide official information about the drug to health care professionals. These pamphlets are attached to bulk containers of drugs purchased by pharmacies so that the pharmacist has the most updated official information on the product. The package inserts are also published in textbooks such as the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/pdr\">Physician’s Desk Reference</a> and on websites maintained by drug manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>The requirement for product package inserts came out of a consumer protection law passed in 1966, called the <a href=\"https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-package-insert\">Fair Packaging and Labeling Act</a>, which aimed to prevent unfair or deceptive packaging in products used by consumers. </p>\n\n<p>The package insert carries a <a href=\"https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-package-insert\">set of official information</a> about the drug, provided by the manufacturer and regulated by the FDA. The insert must include who the drug is approved for, proper dosing and administration, and a description of the key clinical trial results that showed it was effective and safe.  </p>\n\n<p>It must also disclose any health risks that the drug poses – such as a boxed warning. </p>\n\n<h2>Flagging safety risks</h2>\n\n<p>The FDA has two categories for the health risks that medications could pose: <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/warnings-and-precautions-contraindications-and-boxed-warning-sections-labeling-human-prescription\">precautions and warnings</a>. Both are listed on the package insert. </p>\n\n<p>Precautions warn clinicians of possible harm that could result in minor or moderate injury to patients. Warnings, on the other hand, alert them to the potential risk of dangerous adverse events that could result in serious injury or death. The <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/article/what-are-boxed-warnings.html\">most serious warnings</a> for a drug are called boxed warnings. The text of those warnings is enclosed by a black box on the insert so they will not be missed by clinicians. </p>\n\n<p>According to a 2022 study, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2022.08.033\">more than 400 medications</a> currently carry black box warnings. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7a42FY8-J9U?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The FDA announced it was removing the black box warning from hormone therapy for menopause.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Antidepressants are one example. While such drugs can lessen the severity of depression symptoms, researchers have found that during the first few weeks of taking them, patients have an increased risk of suicide – particularly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ph3092861\">children and young adults</a>. The FDA first <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1408480\">issued a black box warning</a> about the drugs’ use in children and adolescents in 2004 and expanded the warning to young adults in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/019758s062lbl.pdf\">clozapine, a drug used to suppress delusions</a> experienced by people with schizophrenia. Although the drug is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11071030\">very effective</a>, the FDA first gave it a black box warning when it was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.56781/ijsrbp.2025.6.1.0024\">reintroduced to the market in 1989</a> because it can stop the production of white blood cells, potentially leading to life-threatening infections.</p>\n\n<p>Hormone replacement therapy for menopause got its black box warning in 2003 after a clinical trial called the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-womens-health-initiative-has-shaped-womens-health-for-over-30-years-but-its-future-is-uncertain-255311\">Women’s Health Initiative</a> pointed to an increased risk of breast cancer without a reduced risk of heart disease in women who used it. </p>\n\n<p>In subsequent years, reanalyses of the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6542\">Women’s Health Initiative</a> results, as well as data from other studies, have shown that the therapy is safe in women ages 50 to 60. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493191/\">Newer, safer formulations of estrogen and progestin</a> have also emerged. These factors <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.22259\">prompted the FDA to remove the warnings</a> in November 2025, saying the therapy <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-fda-initiates-removal-of-black-box-warnings-from-menopausal-hormone-replacement-therapy-products.html\">doesn’t pose significant risks</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Medical and legal realities</h2>\n\n<p>Black box warnings <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.57597\">can influence clinicians’ choice</a> of whether or not to prescribe a particular drug. For example, since other drugs for schizophrenia do not carry the serious risks that clozapine does, clinicians usually reserve that medicine for people who could not use those other drugs. </p>\n\n<p>The black box warnings can also <a href=\"https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-package-insert\">play a role in malpractice cases</a>. In some states, package inserts and any warnings they contain can be used to establish a standard of care, leaving clinicians who deviate from them liable for damages. In other states, the warnings they list can be used to support findings of negligence. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, the black box warning on the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/020785s067lbl.pdf\">insert of the drug thalidomide</a> states it can cause birth defects. It instructs clinicians to obtain a\na negative pregnancy test before use and ensure the patient is not able to get pregnant or is taking precautions to avoid pregnancy before prescribing. Failure to do so could make the clinician liable if the person taking the drug bears a child with birth defects. </p>\n\n<p>Product package inserts are living documents. As new information becomes available, the FDA may find a medication’s risk is untenable and request the drug be removed from the market. Or it may decide to remove the boxed warning from the drug if new data shows the drug is less dangerous than previously thought.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269470/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>C.

For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/responsibility-and-impact/sustainability/#Expand\">Wells Fargo dropped</a> its goal for the companies the bank finances to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, saying the conditions necessary for meeting that goal, such as policy certainty, consumer behavior and the pace of clean technology development, hadn’t fully materialized. Oil giant BP told investors that earlier optimism about a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/10/energy-transition-trump-climate-ceraweek/%22%22\">fast transition to renewable energy was “misplaced</a>” given the changing regulatory environment.</p>\n\n<p>However, many others, including the <a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/largest-retailers/\">world’s largest retailer</a>, Walmart, aren’t trading their long-term risk planning for Washington’s focus on short-term <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way\">cost savings</a>. They are continuing their climate policies, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/29/the-remarkable-rise-of-greenhushing\">but often doing so quietly to avoid scrutiny</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These companies still face ongoing pressure from state and local governments, the European Union, customers and other sources to reduce their impact on the climate.

For my new book, “<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262553186/corporations-at-climate-crossroads/\">Corporations at Climate Crossroads</a>,” I interviewed executives and analyzed corporate climate actions and environmental performance of <a href=\"https://fortunemedia.mediaroom.com/2025-07-29-Fortune-Announces-2025-Fortune-Global-500-List\">Global 500</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#data\">S&amp;P 500</a> companies over the past decade.</p>\n\n<p>These companies’ climate decisions are <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709970/Theory-of-Multilevel-Governance-Drivers-of\">driven by a complex interplay</a> of pressures from existing and future laws and the need to earn goodwill with employees, customers, investors, regulators and others. </p>\n\n<h2>States wield influence, too</h2>\n\n<p>In the U.S., state climate regulations affect multinational corporations. That’s especially true in California – the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/04/23/california-is-now-the-4th-largest-economy-in-the-world/\">world’s fourth largest economy</a> and the state with the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">largest population</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While President Donald Trump dismantles U.S. climate policies, California has moved in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p>California’s newly enacted climate laws <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1207\">extend its cap-and-trade program</a>, now called “cap and invest,” which is designed to ratchet down corporate emissions. They also lock in binding targets to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. And they set clean-power levels that rival the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">Europe Union’s Green Deal</a> and outpace most national governments.</p>\n\n<p>Other states have joined California in committing to meet the goals of the international Paris climate agreement as part of the <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/2024-annual-report-oct-2024/\">U.S. Climate Alliance</a>. The <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/members/\">bipartisan coalition of 24 governors</a>, from Arizona’s to Vermont’s, represents over half of the U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"NCJKl\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NCJKl/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Several states have been <a href=\"https://www.quorum.us/spreadsheet/external/xfFTMjAKXRGVTRlQOeOI/\">considering “polluters pay” laws</a>. These laws would require companies to pay for their contributions to climate change, with the money going into funds for adaptation projects. <a href=\"https://ncel.net/articles/polluters-pay-how-states-are-filling-the-federal-climate-funding-gap-in-2025/\">Vermont and New York passed</a> similar laws in 2024. </p>\n\n<h2>Climate laws still apply in Europe and elsewhere</h2>\n\n<p>Outside the U.S., several countries have climate regulations that multinational companies must meet.</p>\n\n<p>The European Union aims to cut its emissions by at least 50% by 2030 through policies including binding <a href=\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en\">climate reporting rules</a> for large corporations and <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\">carbon taxes for goods entering the EU</a>, along with <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/green-deal-industrial-plan_en\">initiatives to support innovation and competitiveness</a> in clean energy and green infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>Companies also face emissions reporting requirements in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-enshrine-mandatory-climate-disclosures-for-largest-companies-in-law\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/mandatory-climate-related-financial-disclosures/\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sgx.com/sustainable-finance/sustainability-reporting\">Singapore</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/exxon-apple-and-other-corporate-giants-will-have-to-disclose-all-their-emissions-under-californias-new-climate-laws-that-will-have-a-global-impact-214630\">California</a> and cities like <a href=\"https://www.sfc.hk/en/Rules-and-standards/Securities-and-Futures-Ordinance-Part-XV---Disclosure-of-Interests\">Hong Kong</a>. Timelines for some of those laws have shifted, but they’re moving forward.  </p>\n\n<p>The International Court of Justice also issued a recent <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">advisory opinion</a> establishing that countries around the globe have a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-world-court-just-ruled-countries-can-be-held-liable-for-climate-change-damage-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us-262272\">legal obligation to protect the climate</a>. That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p>\n\n<h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2>\n\n<p>Multinational companies’ efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers – meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers.</p>\n\n<p>Given its enormous purchasing volume, Walmart’s procurement standards ripple through vast supply chains. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca Cola, Samsung and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. </p>\n\n<p>Walmart did <a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-misses-emissions-reduction-goals/\">push back the deadlines</a> for two of its more ambitious emissions reduction targets in 2025. At the same time, almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is working toward zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p>\n\n<h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"o29Ub\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/o29Ub/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and start-ups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI’s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p>\n\n<p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200%</a>, and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the over 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings.</p>\n\n<h2>Companies look to the future</h2>\n\n<p>As climate risks grow alongside political headwinds, companies are facing both pushes toward and pulls away from protecting the planet from catastrophic effects. Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. </p>\n\n<p>This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268761/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lily Hsueh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Bukaty</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Every few years, Democrats try to convince themselves they’ve found the one – a candidate who can finally speak fluent rural, who looks and sounds like the voters they’ve lost. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rural-voters-dont-necessarily-love-walz-despite-the-camo-hat-and-small-town-upbringing-236973\">that hope was pinned on Tim Walz</a>, the flannel-wearing, “Midwestern nice” governor whose small-town roots were supposed to unlock the rural Midwest for a Harris–Walz victory. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/walz-harris-election-loss-interview\">It did not</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now those expectations have migrated to New England, onto <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-08-21/who-is-graham-platner-and-why-is-he-everywhere-right-now\">Graham Platner – the tattooed veteran and oyster farmer from Maine</a> who swears from the stump, wears sweatshirts instead of suits, and, some believe, could be the party’s blue-collar savior against Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican incumbent running her sixth campaign for U.S. Senate. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-rural-voter/9780231211581/\">I study rural politics and live in rural Maine</a>. I’m skeptical whether Platner can reach the independents and rural moderates Democrats need. But I also see why people think he might: He’s speaking to grievances that are real, measurable and decades in the making.</p>\n\n<p>Platner represents Democrats’ anxieties about class and geography – a projection of the authenticity they hope might reconcile their national brand with rural America. On paper, he’s the kind of figure they imagine can bridge the divide: a plainspoken Mainer. </p>\n\n<p>But his story cuts both ways. He’s the grandson of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/arts/design/warren-platner-designer-is-dead-at-86.html\">a celebrated Manhattan architect</a>, <a href=\"https://lawyers.justia.com/lawyer/bronson-platner-1009435\">his father is a lawyer</a> and his mother is a <a href=\"https://www.ironboundmaine.com/news-updates/ironbound-restaurant-reopening-may-21-2025\">restaurateur whose business caters to summer tourists</a>. He attended the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/maines-graham-platner-thinks-voters-will-overlook-his-past-to-support-a-new-type-of-candidate\">elite Hotchkiss</a> School.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a life of silver spoons and salt air. That tension mirrors the Democratic party itself, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-in-rural-suburban-and-urban-communities/\">led and funded by urban professionals</a> who are increasingly aware of just how far they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-suzanne-mettler.html\">strayed from their working-class roots</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If Platner is to prevail, he must assemble a coalition that expands beyond what the party has become – concentrated in urban and coastal enclaves, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/business/dealbook/dnc-democratic-party-money-machine.html\">financed nationally</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-politics-rural-america\">culturally distant from much of rural America</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Platner’s immediate hurdle isn’t rural Maine at all. It is the Democratic primary, and those voters do not live where his campaign imagery is set.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of people in a meeting listen to someone.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701984/original/file-20251112-56-lbmspo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Crowd members at a town hall meeting in the southern Maine town of Ogunquit listen to U.S. senatorial candidate Graham Platner on Oct. 22, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/USElection2026MaineSenate/68f4bd2477974e5c802bfbe45a160cca/photo?vs=false\">Sophie Park/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Opportunity zone</h2>\n\n<p>In 2024, nearly 6 in 10 registered Democrats in Maine <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/news/latest-enrolled-and-registered-data-files-posted-online\">lived south of the state capital Augusta</a>. That part of the state would not constitute an urban metropolis anywhere else in the U.S., but it is a drastically different world than the one Platner is fighting for. </p>\n\n<p>The party’s gravitational center sits in Cumberland and York counties: Greater Portland and the southern coastal strip. That electorate is more <a href=\"https://hdpulse.nimhd.nih.gov/data-portal/_social/education/table?statefips=23&amp;demo=00006\">educated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2025/01/15/census-suggests-a-new-richest-portland-suburb-fewer-french-mainers/\">affluent</a> and <a href=\"http://www.maine.gov/dafs/economist/news/may-15-25/population-growth-trends-maine-cities-and-towns-2023-2024\">urban</a> than the state as a whole, clustered in Portland’s walkable neighborhoods, college towns such as Brunswick and artsy coastal communities that swell with summer tourists. </p>\n\n<p>Southern Maine – closer in feel to Boston’s suburbs than to the paper mills and potato fields up north – is where Democrats are already strong. Collins’ vulnerability lies instead among independents in small cities and towns, in deindustrialized and rural counties <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/11/11/politics/elections/maine-political-realignment-after-election-joam40zk0w/\">drifting rightward for two decades</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Maine,_2020\">2020 U.S. Senate race</a> – one that nearly every analyst, myself included, <a href=\"https://newspaper.pressherald.com/infinity/article_popover_share.aspx?guid=056b2cb6-04da-40d8-922a-50389d96940d\">thought Collins was doomed to lose</a> to Democrat Sara Gideon – makes that reality clear. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-senate-elections-susan-collins-24bf18aa14a2c1178d36e02eaeed6941\">Collins outperformed Donald Trump in every county</a>. She built commanding margins in rural Maine, offsetting Democratic gains in Portland and the southern coast. Her real breakthrough came in the kinds of small towns where Trump lost and she won or closed the margin: Ellsworth, Brewer, Machias, Gardiner and Winterport.</p>\n\n<p>Those former mill towns and service hubs <a href=\"https://maineaflcio.org/news/maine-workers-who-joined-uprising-34\">once anchored the Maine Democratic Party</a>. They’re home to exactly the kinds of voters who, in principle, might give someone like Platner a hearing: not deeply ideological, modestly skeptical of both parties and wary of national polarization. </p>\n\n<p>But they are also the voters least represented in the Democratic primary electorate or the donor class fueling Platner’s campaign.</p>\n\n<h2>Doing it as a Democrat</h2>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S6ME00373/\">most recent Federal Election Commission figures</a>, only about 12% of Platner’s haul has even come from inside Maine. The nationalization of campaign finance is <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X231220639\">becoming more common for U.S. Senate candidates</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But there are two differences worth noting. </p>\n\n<p>Platner’s in-state share is higher and more geographically diffuse than Gideon’s 2020 campaign. Then, in what became <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2020-10-16/sara-gideon-took-in-39-million-last-quarter-more-than-four-times-what-susan-collins-raised\">Maine’s most expensive Senate race</a>, just 4% of Gideon’s war chest was homegrown. Most of that Maine money was heavily concentrated in Portland and the southern coastal corridor. </p>\n\n<p>While 64% of Gideon’s Maine total fundraising amount came from the three southernmost counties, 88% of Platner’s current in-state funding is from outside the urban-suburban core of southern Maine. </p>\n\n<p>That divergence matters. It suggests that while Platner’s campaign is still fueled by national money, its local base – however small – extends beyond the usual Portland orbit.</p>\n\n<p>And there is a reason Platner’s message has not been dead on arrival. </p>\n\n<p>The economic populism he’s advancing speaks directly to the material frustrations many rural residents express – frustration with corporate consolidation, rising costs and the feeling that prosperity never reaches their communities. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/X11EP6\">2024 Cooperative Election Study</a> shows that rural independents and moderates often share progressive instincts on precisely these issues: Large majorities of rural, moderate/independent New Englanders support higher taxes on the wealthy and expanded health coverage. Platner is emphasizing those issues – corporate power, health costs, infrastructure, wages – where the urban–rural divide is narrowest. </p>\n\n<p>Platner may be closing that gap. In an October 2025 survey, 58% of likely <a href=\"https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1896&amp;context=survey_center_polls\">Democratic primary voters named him</a> as their first choice for the 2026 Senate nomination. While that support has likely changed in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-know-about-maines-tumultuous-senate-primary-race\">two controversies</a> – his chest tattoo that resembled a Nazi icon and recent posts on Reddit, including one in which he says rural people “actually are” “stupid” and “racist” – that poll’s most notable finding is the consistency of support across income and education levels. </p>\n\n<p>Still, while his message may bridge income and education, the biggest obstacle facing Platner is the simplest one: He’s trying to do all of this as a Democrat. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman in a red parka speaking into a microphone at a lectern, in front of an American flag.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/702032/original/file-20251112-66-c5hodb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Republican U.S. Sen.

Those alignments fade when policy is framed through the institutions and moral language of a party many no longer see as compatible with rural ways of living. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not clear yet how Platner will respond on issues that don’t poll well in rural Maine – environmental regulation, gun control or immigration – where loyalty to the national agenda has <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-rural-voter/9780231211581/\">undone many would-be reformers before him</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And that schism is not because rural voters misunderstand their “self-interest” or because racial dog whistles have led them astray. It is hostility toward a party that, with rare exception, sees the future as something rural America must adapt to, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/05/white-rural-rage-myth-00150395\">not something it should help define</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That is the danger of treating biography as the solution to a decades-long realignment. Platner might be as close as Democrats have come in years to a candidate who can talk credibly to rural voters about power, place and policy. But he still has to do it while wearing the “scarlet D” – the weight of a party brand built over generations.</p>\n\n<p>Whether he wins or loses, his campaign already points to a deeper question: Can Democrats do more than rent rural authenticity? Put more bluntly, the real test is not whether Platner can speak to rural Maine, it is whether his party can finally learn to hear it.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269466/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Nicholas Jacobs does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>In the most talked-about film from the final year of the 20th century, “<a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/matrix\">The Matrix</a>,” a computer hacker named Neo finds that the world he lives and works in isn’t real. It’s a virtual reality, created by artificial intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, the idea seemed like science fiction. In the years since, however, that concept has become an increasingly credible theory: “<a href=\"https://builtin.com/hardware/simulation-theory\">the simulation hypothesis</a>.” This theory posits that, like Neo, living things are characters inside a computer-generated simulation – or, as I describe in <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/774523/the-simulation-hypothesis-by-rizwan-virk/\">my 2025 book</a>, a massively multiplayer video game. In this hypothesis, the physical world around us is actually <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/3849579\">part of a virtual reality</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Simulation theory raises the kind of questions <a href=\"https://rerc-journal.tsd.ac.uk/index.php/religiousexp/article/view/142\">once reserved for mystics and religious scholars</a>: Why are we here? Is there more to reality than we can see? Is there a creator? Are we more than our physical bodies? </p>\n\n<p>The science and technology may be modern, but in some ways, this hypothesis echoes ideas that faith traditions have explored for centuries.</p>\n\n<h2>Living in a game?</h2>\n\n<p>Simulation theory <a href=\"https://simulation-argument.com/simulation/\">became popular from the work</a> of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQwpz3QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">philosopher Nick Bostrom</a>, particularly a paper he published in 2003. The basic argument goes like this: If technology continues to improve, humans will be able to build virtual worlds indistinguishable from physical reality, and AI characters indistinguishable from biological beings. This suggests it’s possible that a more advanced civilization has already reached that point – and that we are inside one of their simulations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A bald man wearing glasses and a gray top poses solemnly in front of a whiteboard with equations in green marker.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=416&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701186/original/file-20251107-56-czwn7w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=523&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Philosopher Nick Bostrom, pictured in 2015, first proposed the simulation hypothesis in 2003.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nick-bostrom-philosopher-at-the-future-of-humanity-news-photo/502680318?adppopup=true\">Tom Pilston for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/do-we-live-in-a-computer-simulation-like-in-the-matrix-my-proposed-new-law-of-physics-backs-up-the-idea-215552\">Physicists</a>, <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/CAMOTT-5\">mathematicians</a>, technologists and computer scientists have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/phpr.13122\">jumped into the game</a>. Opinions span a wide range of probabilities. Columbia University astronomer <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=UXY08zEAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">David Kipping</a> tried to <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/\">evaluate the odds</a> we live in a simulation and came up with about 50/50. Some thinkers doubt that the question is even answerable, while others think the theory is impossible – like a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.22128/jhap.2025.1024.1118\">2025 paper</a> arguing that no purely algorithmic system can explain the universe.</p>\n\n<p>The simulation hypothesis does not have to mean that people in the simulation are only soulless, computed AI inside someone else’s creation. In “The Matrix,” for example, even though Neo and other humans are characters inside the simulation, they also existed outside of the virtual world. </p>\n\n<h2>Higher intelligence</h2>\n\n<p>Simulation theory implies there is a greater intelligence than our own that exists beyond the physical world and may have created our universe – echoing foundational beliefs in many religious traditions. Transhumanist philosopher David Pearce, in fact, called Bostrom’s argument “the first interesting <a href=\"https://simulation-argument.com/\">argument for the existence of a Creator</a> in 2000 years.”</p>\n\n<p>The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, for example, all worship a single creator. The biblical <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.1?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0\">Book of Genesis</a> describes God creating the world in six days, and there is <a href=\"https://quran.com/al-araf/54\">a similar narrative</a> <a href=\"https://quran.com/al-araf\">in the Quran</a>. According to these scriptures, God simply spoke, and it happened.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the simulation hypothesis argues that the world was created through commands – that is, through code. Today, users of AI issue verbal prompts to automatically create realistic pictures and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real people and landscapes. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, users can even prompt AI programs to create characters that insist they aren’t virtual, as some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfV4sidcJM\">have done in recent months</a> – a phenomenon <a href=\"https://hybridhorizons.substack.com/p/the-prompt-theory-phenomenon\">called “prompt theory</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>In August 2025, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time\">Google released Genie 3</a>, which lets users create realistic-looking worlds that they can navigate through, like in a video game. In the past, these virtual worlds needed to be created by hand by teams of designers, limiting how big or complex they could be. Today, as AI advances, the idea that vast virtual worlds could be created to seem as large as our own is no longer considered such a fantasy.</p>\n\n<h2>Body and soul</h2>\n\n<p>A second way modern simulation theory echoes traditional religions is in the idea of the relationship between the soul and the body. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393635805\">One version of the hypothesis</a> – what I call the RPG, or “role-playing game,” version – suggests the simulation <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/774523/the-simulation-hypothesis-by-rizwan-virk/\">is like a multiplayer video game</a>. Each character inside the game represents the external player who controls them, meaning that, in some sense, the characters exhibit free will. </p>\n\n<p>The term for such a character, an “avatar,” is rooted in Sanskrit, <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/language-and-linguistics/sanskrit-language\">the language of many Hindu, Buddhist and Jain texts</a>. In Hinduism, an “avatar” refers to the incarnation of a divine being in the form of a human body.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Small, intricately carved ivory statues of human and half-human, half-animal figures.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701187/original/file-20251107-56-1wxxjr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The 10 main avatars of the Hindu deity Vishnu.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dashavtar_closeup_national_museum_india.JPG\">Nomu420/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The idea of incarnation, or a soul entering a body, is one of the most mysterious aspects of many religious traditions. Describing the development of an unborn child, the Hadith – the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad – describe a moment when “<a href=\"https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6594\">the soul is breathed into him</a>.” The Bible, too, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&amp;version=KJV\">uses the metaphor of breath</a> to describe incarnation: “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</p>\n\n<p>Another common metaphor is that the soul dons the body, just as the body puts on clothing. Rumi, whose poetry often explores mystic Sufi themes, <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/RUMITheMathnawiVol3Vol4/RUMI_The-Mathnawi-Vol-3-Vol-4_djvu.txt\">compared the body to a garment</a> that could be <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Essence_of_Rumi_s_Masnevi.html?id=_aIaAQAAIAAJ\">taken off or changed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A similar metaphor was used in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Bhagavad_Gita.html?id=7m7XAAAAMAAJ\">the Bhagavad Gita</a>, a Hindu scripture: “Just as you throw out used clothes and put on other clothes, new ones, the Self discards its used bodies and puts on others that are new.”</p>\n\n<p>If we think about the soul as the player of a virtual reality game, and the body as merely their character inside who has forgotten about the outside world, then the parallels between religion and simulation theory are clear. The game may end, or the character may die, but the player continues to exist outside the game. Some religions teach that each soul can be reincarnated, having many lives – as though the player goes in and plays the game again and again, playing many different characters.</p>\n\n<h2>Immersed in a dream</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A stone statue of a man with a topknot wearing loosely draped robes, with a circle behind his head.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=995&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=995&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=995&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1250&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1250&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701188/original/file-20251107-64-50r4pr.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1250&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A first- or second-century C.E. depiction of the Buddha from Gandhara, in present-day Afghanistan.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg\">Tokyo National Museum/World Imaging via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There is also an even more fundamental way simulation theory echoes some religious teachings: the idea that the physical world is not real, or is not all there is to reality.</p>\n\n<p>This is clear in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, which describe the world being a result of “maya,” or an illusion. Often, this is expressed through the metaphor of the world being like a dream that one can awaken from. Indeed, a popular definition of the term “Buddha” is someone who has “awakened.”</p>\n\n<p>The “Samadhiraja Sutra,” or “<a href=\"https://www.lionsroar.com/the-playful-dance-of-awakened-mind/\">King of Samadhi Sutra</a>,” for example, teaches:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Know all things to be like this:<br>\nA mirage, a cloud castle,<br>\nA dream, an apparition,<br>\nWithout essence, but with qualities that can be seen.</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452\">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>, a Hindu monk who died in 1952, wrote “Autobiography of a Yogi,” which introduced meditation and yoga to many in the West. Trying to explain the idea of “maya,” which is often translated as “illusion,” he compared people’s sense of physical reality <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452\">to actors playing in a motion picture</a> – relatively new technology in the 1920s, when he came from India to make his home in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"https://harpercollins.co.in/product/wisdom-of-a-yogi/\">my 2023 book about Yogananda</a>, were the famous swami alive today, perhaps he would update the metaphor to use today’s technology: video games.</p>\n\n<p>In a critical scene in “The Matrix,” Neo’s mentor, Morpheus – named after the Greek god of dreams – tells him that he has been living in a dream world. The simulation hypothesis, too, proposes that people may be living in a dream world, albeit one that is virtual, created and maintained by AI.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the only reaction is to echo Neo and say: Whoa.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269335/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rizwan Virk owns shares in Google, and in various video game companies.

This atmosphere would have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/our-mostly-dry-planetary-neighbors-once-had-lots-of-water-what-does-that-imply-for-us-43817\">enabled liquids to flow</a> on its surface, creating the channels and gullies that scientists can still observe today. </p>\n\n<p>But where did the bulk of this atmosphere go? Its loss turned Mars into the cold and dry world it is today, with a surface air pressure <a href=\"https://marsed.asu.edu/mep/atmosphere\">less than 1% of Earth’s</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Mars also once <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/mars-has-the-remnants-of-a-lopsided-magnetic-field\">had a magnetic field</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/earths-magnetic-field-protects-life-on-earth-from-radiation-but-it-can-move-and-the-magnetic-poles-can-even-flip-216231\">like Earth’s</a>, that helped to shield its atmosphere.

These measurements will help to reveal where the atmosphere went and how quickly Mars is still losing it today.</p>\n\n<h2>Weathering space on a budget</h2>\n\n<p>Space is not a friendly place. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-space-made-of-an-astrophysics-expert-explains-all-the-components-from-radiation-to-dark-matter-found-in-the-vacuum-of-space-235402\">Most of it is a vacuum</a> – that is, mostly empty, without the gas molecules that create pressure and allow you to breathe or transfer heat. These molecules keep things from getting too hot or too cold. In space, with no pressure, a spacecraft can easily get too hot or too cold, depending on whether it is in sunlight or in shadow. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the Sun and other, farther astronomical objects <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/radtown/cosmic-radiation\">emit radiation</a> that living things do not experience on Earth. Earth’s magnetic field protects you from the worst of this radiation. So when humans or our robotic representatives leave the Earth, our spacecraft must survive in this extreme environment not present on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE will overcome these challenges with a shoestring <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-escapade-mission-launch-date?\">budget totaling US$80 million</a>. That is a lot of money, but for a mission to another planet it is inexpensive. It has kept costs low by leveraging commercial technologies for deep space exploration, which is now possible because of prior investments in fundamental research.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/grail/\">GRAIL mission</a>, launched in 2011, previously used two spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, to map the Moon’s gravity fields. ESCAPADE takes this concept to another world, Mars, and costs <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/new-nasa-mission-to-reveal-moons-internal-structure-and-evolution/\">a fraction as much as GRAIL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Led by Rob Lillis of UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/escapade/2025/09/22/nasas-escapade-spacecraft-return-to-florida-to-prepare-for-launch/\">this collaboration</a> between spacecraft builders Rocket Lab, trajectory specialists Advanced Space LLC and launch provider Blue Origin – all commercial partners funded by NASA – aims to show that deep space exploration is now faster, more agile and more affordable than ever before.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJpt0MPmr7Y?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">NASA’s ESCAPADE represents a partnership between a university, commercial companies and the government.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>How will ESCAPADE get to Mars?</h2>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE will also use a new trajectory to get to Mars. Imagine being an archer in the Olympics. To hit a bull’s-eye, you have to shoot an arrow through a 15-inch – 40-centimeter – circle from a distance of 300 feet, or 90 meters. Now imagine the bull’s-eye represents Mars. To hit it from Earth, you would have to shoot an arrow through the same 15-inch bull’s-eye at a distance of over 13 miles, or 22 kilometers. You would also have to shoot the arrow in a curved path so that it goes around the Sun. </p>\n\n<p>Not only that, but <a href=\"https://www.space.com/16875-how-far-away-is-mars.html\">Mars won’t be at the bull’s-eye</a> at the time you shoot the arrow. You must shoot for the spot that Mars will be in 10 months from now. This is the problem that the ESCAPADE mission designers faced. What is amazing is that the physical laws and forces of nature are so predictable that this was not even the hardest problem to solve for the ESCAPADE mission.</p>\n\n<p>It takes energy to get from one place to another. To go from Earth to Mars, a spacecraft has to carry the energy it needs, in the form of rocket fuel, much like gasoline in a car. As a result, a high percentage of the total launch mass has to be fuel for the trip.</p>\n\n<p>When going to Mars orbit from Earth orbit, as much as 80% to 85% of the spacecraft mass has to be propellant, which means not much mass is dedicated to the part of the spacecraft that does all the experiments. This issue makes it important to pack as much capability into the rest of the spacecraft as possible. For ESCAPADE, the propellant is only about <a href=\"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/advspace.publicshare/Papers-Presentations/2022/Parker_ESCAPADE-A-Low-Cost-Formation-at-Mars.pdf\">65% of the spacecraft’s mass</a>.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE’s route is particularly fuel-efficient. First, Blue and Gold will go to the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-a-lagrange-point/\">L2 Lagrange point</a>, one of five places where gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth cancel out. Then, after about a year, during which they will collect data monitoring the Sun, they will fly by the Earth, using its gravitational field <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/primer/\">to get a boost</a>. This way, they will arrive at Mars in about 10 more months. </p>\n\n<p>This new approach has another advantage beyond needing to carry less fuel: Trips from Earth to Mars are typically favorable to save fuel about every 26 months due to the two planets’ relative positions. However, this new trajectory makes the departure time more flexible. Future cargo and human missions could use a similar trajectory to have more frequent and less time-constrained trips to Mars.</p>\n\n<p>ESCAPADE is a testament to a new era in spaceflight. For a new generation of scientists and engineers, ESCAPADE is not just a mission – it is a blueprint for a new collaborative era of exploration and discovery.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was updated on Nov. 13, 2025 to reflect the ESCAPADE launch’s date and success.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269321/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Christopher E.

      "content": "<p>There never seems to be a shortage of good crime shows on TV, and network television is teeming with detectives who think – and act – differently. </p>\n\n<p>This fall, new seasons of “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26591110/\">Elsbeth</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22091076/\">High Potential</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31495377/\">Patience</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22475008/\">Watson</a>” have aired, and they all feature leads who share similar characteristics: They’re outsiders, they’re socially awkward, they can be emotionally distant, and their minds operate in unconventional ways. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, they all possess traits that align with what many people now associate with neurodivergence – <a href=\"https://neuroqueer.com/neurodiversity-terms-and-definitions/\">what scholar Nick Walker defines as</a> “a mind that functions in ways that diverge significantly from the dominant societal standards of ‘normal.’”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qDgI93wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">As a scholar of popular culture</a>, I’ve long been fascinated by this recurring character type – detectives who might, today, be diagnosed as having autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n\n<p>While researching my forthcoming book, “The Autistic Detective,” I’ve come to realize that most detectives in popular culture – yes, even Sherlock Holmes – exhibited neurodivergent characteristics, long before the term existed.</p>\n\n<h2>The thin line between genius and madness</h2>\n\n<p>In the late 19th century, when Sherlock Holmes was created, there was widespread scientific interest in the workings of the mind, particularly the thin line between genius and madness.  </p>\n\n<p>British psychologist <a href=\"https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-children-and-childhood-studies/chpt/sully-james#_\">James Sully</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_27/August_1885/Genius_and_Insanity\">described “men of genius</a>” as exhibiting “intellectual or moral peculiarities which are distinctly symptomatic of mental disease,” naming Edgar Allan Poe as an example of the “tragic fatefulness of geniuses.” Italian criminologist <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/cesare-lombroso\">Cesare Lombroso</a>, meanwhile, proposed that madness, genius and criminality were all closely intertwined.</p>\n\n<p>Such a fascination with exceptional minds – and the idea that madness and genius are two sides of the same coin – fed into the heart of detective fiction. And although later scholars <a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253018007/imagining-autism/\">have criticized the linking of neurodivergence</a> to pathology, violence or genius, the trope remains common in popular culture, where it’s often used to signal the exceptional mind of a detective figure.</p>\n\n<p>Now, however, many fans are able to connect these characteristics to specific diagnostic labels. According to CDC data from April 2025, autism diagnoses in U.S. children have risen sharply over the past two decades – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-autism-rates-are-rising-and-why-that-could-lead-to-more-inclusive-communities-257811\">from about 1 in 150 in 1998 to roughly 1 in 31 today</a>. This reflects not only a broadened definition of the autism spectrum but also signals greater public awareness and acceptance of neurodivergence.</p>\n\n<p>That growing understanding has led to renewed interest in Holmes. From online fan forums to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06diagnosis-t.html\">The New York Times</a>, people have debated whether Holmes <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainsnacks/201110/did-sherlock-holmes-have-asperger-syndrome\">might be autistic</a>, wondered whether <a href=\"https://globalcomment.com/bbcs-sherlock-asperger%E2%80%99s-syndrome-and-sociopathy/\">another label would be more appropriate</a>, or highlighted <a href=\"https://wellingtongoose.tumblr.com/post/73655375305/sherlock-should-not-represent-autism-from-4\">the futility of trying to diagnose a fictional character</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Super intelligence and social dysfunction</h2>\n\n<p>That said, it’s hard not to see some neurodivergent traits in Sherlock Holmes and other fictional detectives.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-tunnel-vision/\">Tunnel vision</a>, <a href=\"https://embrace-autism.com/autism-strengths-and-challenges/\">pattern recognition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=67018&amp;section=2.2\">attention to detail</a> are all traits that could be exhibited by autistic people. </p>\n\n<p>Holmes was fixated on minute details: One story highlighted how he authored <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm#chap04\">a study on the ashes of 140 different varieties</a> of pipe, cigar and cigarette tobacco. He had an unmatched talent for noticing overlooked details and piecing together disparate clues. And he was obsessed with forensic science. </p>\n\n<p>He could also come off as cold. As Holmes declared in “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2097/2097-h/2097-h.htm\">The Sign of the Four</a>,” “Emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning.”</p>\n\n<p>In Edgar Allan Poe’s 1841 short story “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25525/25525-h/25525-h.htm#chap07\">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>,” which is widely considered the first detective fiction story, the protagonist, C. Auguste Dupin, also hyperfocuses on small details, reasons through “pure logic” and is socially reclusive – all qualities displayed by Holmes. </p>\n\n<p>Even Dr. Watson, Holmes’ sidekick, noticed the resemblance. </p>\n\n<p>“You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin,” he tells Holmes in “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/244/244-h/244-h.htm\">A Study in Scarlet</a>.” “I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle famously killed off the detective <a href=\"https://alpinehikers.com/reichenbach-falls-meiringen-switzerland-the-end-of-sherlock-holmes-the-first-time/\">at Reichenbach Falls</a> in his 1893 story “<a href=\"https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/pdf/a4/1-sided/fina.pdf\">The Final Problem</a>,” there was so much public outrage that the author was eventually forced <a href=\"https://booksofbrilliance.com/2025/09/03/how-the-public-brought-sherlock-holmes-back-from-the-dead/\">to bring him back from the dead</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These 19th-century Sherlock enthusiasts <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-companion-to-sherlock-holmes/sherlockian-fandom/B86822AEA7E2A6422183B2B82204B964\">were predecessors to today’s media fandoms</a>. Their level of devotion, unlike anything previously seen for a fictional character, was a testament to the power of Doyle’s formula: an extraordinary investigator with savantlike cognitive abilities who upholds logic over emotion, thrives in solitude and yet still depends on his companion – in Holmes’ case, Dr. Watson, who serves as an emotional counterbalance. </p>\n\n<p>In the 21st century, that formula has been revived in <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315637518-34/transnational-media-fan-studies-lori-morimoto\">wildly popular</a> TV shows such as “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/\">Bones</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452046/\">Criminal Minds</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/\">Sherlock</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, “Sherlock” co-creator Steven Moffat <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160106-how-sherlock-holmes-changed-the-world\">told the BBC</a>, “Doyle began the idea that super-intelligence comes at the price of some kind of social dysfunction, something that we’ve grasped as a narrative possibility ever since.” </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the more eccentric – or socially dysfunctional – a detective is, the more ingenious the hero seems.  </p>\n\n<h2>A new era for the detective</h2>\n\n<p>Detective fiction might have started as a way to explore the deviant, non-normative minds of detectives and the criminals they pursued. But it has since become a space for neurodivergent self-representation.</p>\n\n<p>Today, scholars, fans, reviewers and scientists <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003011668-7/psychopath-sociopath-autistic-malynnda-johnson\">openly discuss diagnostic labels for fictional characters</a>. This surge in interest coincides with a rise in research on <a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9781477324943/\">portrayals of autism in the media</a> and a growing number of autistic voices examining <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2023.104484\">how those portrayals shape public understanding</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Disability scholars have long warned of disabled characters <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/on-screen-and-on-stage-disability-continues-to-be-depicted-in-outdated-cliched-ways-130577\">being used as mere plot devices</a> and have criticized the lack of diversity in representations of <a href=\"https://the-art-of-autism.com/we-need-more-autistic-women-on-tv-and-heres-why/\">detectives who appear to be autistic</a> on screen.</p>\n\n<p>Yet many of the new shows <a href=\"https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/cinemaetcie/article/view/16393\">push back against some of the stereotypes</a> of autistic people as cold, lonely and incapable of affection. Instead, they have friends. They have romantic partners. They’re empathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The series “Elsbeth” and “High Potential” center on quirky, intelligent female investigative leads who appear to be on the autism spectrum. In HBO’s 2020 miniseries “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8550800/\">The Outsider</a>,” detective Holly Gibney appears as one of the first Black, autistic female detectives on television.</p>\n\n<p>While most of these characters aren’t explicitly identified as autistic in their shows, “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20869502/\">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>” features a female attorney whose diagnosis is openly discussed by the show’s characters.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxeXECe2t-c?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">‘Extraordinary Attorney Woo’ is a Korean series centered on an autistic, early-career attorney.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The British-Belgian series “Patience,” meanwhile, is the first detective show to feature an explicitly autistic character played by a neurodivergent actress, Ella Maisy Purvis.</p>\n\n<p>“It was really important to me that she wasn’t this kind of robotic, asexual drone,” <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/culture/tv/ella-maisy-purvis-interview-patience-autism/\">Purvis told the Big Issue in 2025</a>. “Patience is highly empathetic. She cares so much about her job and the people around her. It’s just expressed in a different way.”</p>\n\n<p>These varied portrayals coincide with the rise of online fan communities where neurodivergent fans share what these stories mean to them. If the archetypal detective once tried to “make sense” of neurodivergent minds, today’s neurodivergent fans and creators are now having a hand in shaping them.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, they no longer have to wonder whether they’re being represented on screen.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267069/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Soohyun Cho does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And a subset of those workers believed they <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/10/us-news/trump-pledges-to-abide-by-deal-to-end-government-shutdown-but-vows-to-upend-obamacare-subsidies/\">may not have a job to come back to</a> amid efforts by the Trump administration to lay them off permanently. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the University of Michigan’s monthly index on consumer sentiment <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">tumbled to a near record low in November</a> –  a level not seen since the depth of the pandemic. Because lower consumer sentiment is related to reduced spending, that has a <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/ex/mobilecommercedaily/how-the-current-government-shutdown-may-affect-retail-spending\">short-term impact on retailers</a>, too.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"KQQPj\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KQQPj/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>And because parks and monuments have been closed throughout the shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.ustravel.org/press/1-billion-lost-every-week-impact-government-shutdown-travel#\">tourism activity has been down</a> – a decline no doubt worsened <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/business/airlines-cancellations-senate-deal.html\">by the reduction in flights</a> enforced due to shortages in air traffic controllers.</p>\n\n<p>The effect was particularly pronounced in places like Washington D.C. – one of the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2025/05/06/tourism-international-visitors-decline-2025\">most popular destination for tourists</a> – and Hawaii. This short-term effect will likely extend to secondary businesses, such as hotels. Indeed, prior to the shutdown, the U.S. Travel Association warned that such an event would <a href=\"https://www.ustravel.org/press/1-billion-lost-every-week-impact-government-shutdown-travel\">cost the total travel industry</a> around US$1 billion a week.</p>\n\n<h2>And the longer-term impact?</h2>\n\n<p>Estimates range, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that the cost to America’s gross domestic product in lost productivity <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/federal-shutdown-could-cost-us-economy-up-14-billion-2025-10-29/\">is in the range of $7 billion to $14 billion</a> – and that is a cost from a self-imposed wound that will never be recovered.</p>\n\n<p>And from an international macroeconomic point of view, <a href=\"https://devere-investment.com/us-government-shutdown-could-affect-markets-globally/\">trust in the U.S. has been hit</a>. Even before the shutdown, political dysfunction in Washington contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/scope-downgrades-us-credit-rating-public-finance-governance-deterioration-2025-10-24/\">downgrade in the U.S. credit rating</a> – something that could <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o\">result in higher borrowing costs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The shutdown further erodes the United States’ standing as the global leader of the free market and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-rules-based-order-how-this-global-system-has-shifted-from-liberal-origins-and-where-it-could-be-heading-next-250978\">rules-based international order</a>. Accompanied by the economic rise of China, this shutdown further <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-erosion-trust-could-shake-americas-economic-stability\">erodes international investors’ impression of the U.S.</a> as an arbiter and purveyor of the established trade and finance system – and that can only hurt Washington’s global economic standing.</p>\n\n<h2>Has the economic pain been felt evenly?</h2>\n\n<p>Certainly not. Large numbers of Americans have been hit, but the shutdown affected regions and demographics differently. </p>\n\n<p>Those on the lower end of the income distribution have been hit harder. This is in large part due to the impact the shutdown has had on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Some <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-struggling-families-put-food-on-the-table-0\">92% of SNAP benefits go to American households</a> below the federal poverty line. </p>\n\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-gets-snap-benefits-to-buy-groceries-and-what-the-government-pays-for-the-program-in-5-charts-269032\">42 million Americans rely</a> on SNAP payments. And they were caught up in the political maelstrom – left not knowing if their SNAP payments will come, if they will be fully funded and when they will appear.</p>\n\n<p>There is also research that shows <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/01/14/684432894/barely-treading-water-why-the-shutdown-disproportionately-affects-black-american\">Black Americans are affected more</a> by shutdowns than other racial groups. This is because traditionally, Black workers have made up a <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/black-federal-workers-by-state/\">higher percentage of the federal workforce</a> than they do the private sector workforce. </p>\n\n<p>Geographically, too, the impact of this shutdown has been patchy.</p>\n\n<p>California, Washington D.C. and Virginia have <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/workforce-information-faq/general/which-states-has-the-most-federal-employees/\">the highest proportion of federal employees</a>, so that means a larger chunk of the workers in those regions were furloughed. Hawaii has also been disproportionately hit due to the large number of military there. One <a href=\"https://www.khon2.com/local-news/hawai%CA%BBi-lands-at-2-for-most-impacted-states-in-federal-government-shutdown/\">analysis found that with 5.6% of people</a> in the state federally employed, and a further 12% in nonprofit jobs supported by federal funding, Hawaii was the <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/government-shutdown-report/1111\">second-hardest-hit state</a> during the shutdown.</p>\n\n<h2>How easy is it for the US to recover from a shutdown?</h2>\n\n<p>Because shutdowns are always temporary, recovery depends on how long it has gone on for. Traditionally, the long-term economic trend <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/shutdowns-usually-dont-do-much-economic-damage-but-there-are-reasons-to-worry-this-time\">is not badly affected</a> by the short-term pain of shutdowns.</p>\n\n<p>But it may be slightly different this time around. This shutdown went on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598315/government-shutdown-longest-history\">longer than any other shutdown in U.S. history</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the nature of this shutdown raises some concerns. This was the first shutdown in which a president said that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/08/nx-s1-5565233/furloughed-federal-workers-face-threat-of-no-back-pay\">backpay was not a sure thing</a> for all furloughed federal employees. And the uncertainty over those threatened with layoffs again broke from past precedent. Both matters seemed to have been <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/10/government-shutdown-reopen-senate-deal-reverse-firings\">settled with the deal ending the shutdown</a>, but even so, the ongoing uncertainly may have affected the spending patterns of many affected.</p>\n\n<p>And we also do not know what the <a href=\"https://www.airlines.org/news-update/new-data-shows-huge-impact-of-the-government-shutdown-on-airlines-and-our-customers/\">economic impact of the reduction of domestic flights</a> will be.</p>\n\n<h2>Have other economic factors exacerbated the shutdown affect?</h2>\n\n<p>While the shutdowns in Trump’s first administration did take place while tariffs were being used as a foreign policy and economic tool, this year is different.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-trump-tariffs-early-modelling-shows-most-economies-lose-the-us-more-than-many-262491\">tariff war this time around</a> is across the board, hitting both adversaries and allies. As a result, the U.S. economy has been more tentative, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/oct/how-tariffs-are-affecting-prices-2025\">greater uncertainty on inflation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Related to that is the <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings\">rising grocery prices</a> that have contributed to an upward tick in inflation.</p>\n\n<p>This all makes the job of the Federal Reserve harder when it is trying to fine-tune monetary policy to meets its <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate\">dual mandates</a> of full employment and price stability. Add to that the lack of government data for over a month, and it means the Fed is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fed-lowers-interest-rates-as-it-struggles-to-assess-state-of-us-economy-without-key-government-data-267204\">grasping in the dark</a> a little when it comes to charting the U.S. economy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269471/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Amitrajeet A.

But while its risk to grains such as wheat, corn and rice can be alarming, Fusarium isn’t new to American farmers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates it costs wheat and barley farmers <a href=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2025/discovery-may-flip-the-genetic-script-on-fungal-threat-of-wheat/\">more than $1 billion a year</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-sze7nIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Tom Allen</a>, an extension and research professor of plant pathology at Mississippi State University, explains what Fusarium graminearum is and isn’t.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What is <em>Fusarium graminearum</em>?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13081159\"><em>Fusarium graminearum</em></a> is a common fungal plant pathogen that creates problems for farmers across the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>It causes a disease in barley and wheat called <a href=\"https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/bp/bp-33-w.pdf\"><em>Fusarium</em> head blight, or scab</a>. It can also damage rice and rot corn ears and stalks. In severe cases, scab could cut a farm’s yield by 45%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scab has been responsible for some of the greatest annual <a href=\"https://cropprotectionnetwork.org/publications/wheat-disease-loss-estimates-from-the-united-states-and-ontario-canada-2024\">crop losses</a> in the U.S. In 2024, estimates from extension and research plant pathologists suggested scab reduced the U.S. wheat crop by <a href=\"https://cropprotectionnetwork.org/publications/wheat-disease-loss-estimates-from-the-united-states-and-ontario-canada-2024\">approximately 31 million bushels</a> or roughly 2%.</p>\n\n<p>When compared with other wheat diseases that harm the head and kernels, scab is by far the most concerning because it occurs across wide areas and affects the crop at advanced growth stages.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is <em>Fusarium graminearum</em> a concern?</h2>\n\n<p>As a plant pathogen, the fungus responsible for scab produces a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/natural-toxins-food/mycotoxins\">mycotoxin</a> in grain that can harm humans and livestock. In addition, when wheat grain used for seed is infested with the fungus, the seeds are less likely to germinate and produce new plants in the next growing season. </p>\n\n<p>The mycotoxin is widely <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins4111120\">categorized as a vomitoxin</a>. It can induce vomiting if ingested in high enough concentrations, but prolonged exposure can also cause gastronintestinal damage, <a href=\"https://cropprotectionnetwork.org/publications/mycotoxin-faqs\">harm the immune system</a> and inflame the central nervous system. </p>\n\n<p>In animals, repeated exposure to the mycotoxin in food can decrease their growth and weight, and livestock can <a href=\"https://cropwatch.unl.edu/strategies-handling-scabby-and-vomitoxin-affected-wheat-grain/\">develop an immune response</a> to the toxin that can harm their ability to reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-and-fda-advisory-levels-deoxynivalenol-don-finished-wheat-products-human\">issued advisory levels</a>, basically limits for the amount of mycotoxin considered a health hazard in grain products.</p>\n\n<p>Since barley and wheat are important as food for humans and livestock, harvested grain is <a href=\"https://cropprotectionnetwork.org/publications/grain-and-silage-sampling-and-mycotoxin-testing\">routinely tested</a> when farmers bring their crops to grain elevators for sale. Entire loads of grain may be rejected if they’re found to have mycotoxin concentrations above the FDA limits. </p>\n\n<p>Wheat <a href=\"https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/handling-FHB-wheat\">can be treated</a> to remove scabby kernels. If mycotoxin levels aren’t too high, it could also be used for livestock feed. The advisory threshold for the mycotoxin is higher for adult cattle and chickens, at 10 parts per million, than it is for humans, at 1 ppm.</p>\n\n<h2>What does the law say about importing and moving plant pathogens?</h2>\n\n<p>These risks are why importing and even moving plant pathogens within the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or USDA-APHIS, through the <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/plant-protect-act.pdf\">Plant Protection Act of 2000</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Federal law restricts the movement of plant pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses, even for research purposes, as well as their release into the environment. A scientist who wants to move a plant pathogen, either within the U.S. or from outside the U.S., must go through a permitting process with <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/\">USDA-APHIS</a> that can take up to six months to complete.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Travelers in an airport with a sign in the foreground warning against bringing in bananas, soil or plants to avoid harming crops.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/682518/original/file-20250728-56-48vr4f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A sign at a Colombian airport warns about the spread of a type of <em><em>Fusarium</em></em> that affects bananas and plantains.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/bogota-colombia-el-dorado-international-airport-baggage-news-photo/1459105502?adppopup=true\">Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The goal of these rules is to reduce the risk of introducing something new that could be even more destructive for crops. </p>\n\n<p>Even with <em>Fusarium graminearum</em>, which has appeared on every continent but Antarctica, there is potential for introducing new genetic material into the environment that may exist in other countries but not the U.S. and could have harmful consequences for crops.</p>\n\n<h2>How do you manage <em>Fusarium graminearum</em> infections?</h2>\n\n<p><em>Fusarium graminearum</em> infections generally occur during the plant’s flowering, rainfall and periods of <a href=\"https://cropprotectionnetwork.org/publications/an-overview-of-fusarium-head-blight\">high humidity</a> during early stages of grain production. </p>\n\n<p>Wheat in the southern U.S. is conducive to infection during the spring. As the season progresses, the <a href=\"https://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/\">risk from scab progresses north</a> through the U.S. and into Canada as the grain crops mature across the region, with continued periods of conducive weather throughout the summer.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/3867/fusarium3.gif?1754084682?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=720&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2\"><figcaption>How Fusarium graminearum risk progressed in 2025. Yellow is low risk, orange is medium risk, and red is high risk.<a href=\"http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/\"> Fusarium Risk Tool/Penn State</a> </figcaption></figure> \n\n<p>Between seasons, <em>Fusarium graminearum</em> survives on barley, wheat and corn plant residues that remain in the field after harvest. It reproduces by producing microscopic spores that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13081159\">can then travel long distances</a> on wind currents, spreading the fungus across large geographic areas each season.</p>\n\n<p>In wheat and barley, farmers can suppress the damage by spraying a fungicide onto developing wheat heads when they’re most susceptible to infection. Applying fungicide <a href=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/30200525/470%20Integration%20of%20Fungicide%20Application%20and%20Cultivar%20Resistance%20to%20Manage%20Fusarium%20Head%20Blight%20in%20Wheat.pdf\">can reduce scab and its severity</a>, improve grain weight and reduce mycotoxin contamination.</p>\n\n<p>However, integrated approaches to manage plant diseases are generally ideal, including planting barley or wheat varieties that are resistant to scab and also using a carefully timed fungicide application, rotating crops, and tilling the soil after harvest to reduce residue where <em>Fusarium graminearum</em> can survive the winter.</p>\n\n<p>Even though fungicide applications may be beneficial, fungicides offer only some protection and can’t cure scab. If the environmental conditions are extremely conducive for scab, with ample moisture and humidity during flowering, the disease will still occur albeit at reduced levels.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFhtnjQIKeo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A discussion of <em><em>Fusarium</em></em> head blight in the northern Plains.

When Melissa arrived, it struck the same fragile infrastructure that Cubans had barely begun to rebuild.</p>\n\n<p>Haiti’s fragile situation before Hurricane Melissa cannot be overstated. The island nation was still reeling from years of cascading disasters – deadly hurricanes, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/haiti\">political instability</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/instability-haiti\">gang violence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2025/10/28/cholera-returns-to-haiti-as-thousands-of-displaced-people-survive-under-catastrophic-conditions_6746838_114.html\">an ongoing cholera crisis</a> and <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166080\">widespread hunger</a> – with over half the population already <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/haiti-57-million-people-face-high-levels-acute-food-insecurity-gang-violence-tightens-its-grip-across-country-ipc-acute-food-insecurity-snapshot-september-2025-june-2026\">in need of humanitarian assistance</a> even before this storm hit. </p>\n\n<p>This is the new reality of the climate crisis: Disasters hitting the Caribbean are compounding and can trigger infrastructure collapse, social erosion and economic debt spirals.</p>\n\n<h2>The compounding disaster trap</h2>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WDOutcQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">study disasters</a>, with a focus on how Caribbean island systems absorb, adapt to and recover from recurring shocks, like the nations hit by Melissa are now experiencing.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just that hurricanes are more frequent; it’s that the time between major storms is now <a href=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/where/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean_en\">shorter than the time required for a full recovery</a>. This pulls islands into a trap that works through three self-reinforcing loops:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Infrastructure collapse</strong>: When a major hurricane hits an already weakened system, it causes <a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-danger/\">simultaneous infrastructure collapses</a>. The failure of one system – such as power – cascades, taking down water pumps, communications and hospitals all at once. We saw this in <a href=\"https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Documents/GHRI%20Tracker/CenterPoint_Beryl_After_Action_Final_Report.pdf\">Grenada after Hurricane Beryl</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.uwi.edu/ekacdm/node/106\">Dominica after Hurricane Maria</a>. This kind of cascading damage is now the baseline expectation for the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Economic debt spiral:</strong> When countries exhaust their economic reserves on one recovery, <a href=\"https://drgr.org/news/debt-disasters-and-the-price-of-delay-toward-resilient-reform-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/\">borrow to rebuild and are then hit again while still paying off that debt</a>, it becomes a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/14/01/49/pr04240\">vicious cycle</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Ivan, which struck the region in 2004, cost Grenada over <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2018/05/08/developing-a-cost-effective-strategy-for-disaster-risk-financing-to-increase-fiscal-resilience-in-the-oecs-countries\">200% of its gross domestic product</a>; Maria, in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/11/28/a-360-degree-look-at-dominica-post-hurricane-maria\">cost Dominica 224%</a> of its GDP; and Dorian, in 2019, <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/en/impact-hurricane-dorian-bahamas-view-sky\">cost the Bahamas 25%</a> of GDP. With each storm, debt balloons, credit ratings drop and borrowing for the next disaster <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bridging-the-great-finance-divide-in-developing-countries/\">becomes more expensive</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Social erosion:</strong> Each cycle weakens the human infrastructure, too. More than <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/puerto-rico-exodus-after-hurricane-maria-cbsn-originals/\">200,000 people left Puerto Rico</a> for the U.S. mainland in Maria’s aftermath, and <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20180131_acaps_disaster_profile_dominica_v2.pdf\">nearly one-quarter of Dominica’s population left</a> after the same storm. Community networks fragment as people leave, and <a href=\"https://hupcfl.com/how-hurricanes-trigger-long-term-mental-health-struggles/\">psychological trauma becomes layered</a> as each new storm reopens the wounds of the last.

After Beryl, Grenada became the <a href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/08/21/in-a-world-first-grenada-activates-debt-pause-after-hurricane-beryl-destruction/\">first government to activate</a> a hurricane clause with private creditors.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://sdg.iisd.org/news/caribbean-leaders-discuss-debt-for-climate-adaptation-swap-caribbean-resilience-fund/\">Comprehensive debt-for-climate swaps</a> involve reducing existing debt – owed to private banks, institutional investors, countries or multilateral banks – <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/debt-for-climate-swaps-a-primer-for-fics-members/\">in exchange</a> for the debtor country committing funds to climate adaptation or resilience projects.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/why-article-6-should-increase-climate-action-not-delay-it/\">Pre-positioned climate finance</a> is money made available through <a href=\"https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/financially-prepared-case-pre-positioned-finance\">dedicated international climate funds</a>, such as the Green Climate Fund and Loss and Damage Fund, or <a href=\"https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/dam/jcr:0cd24f12-ebfb-425a-ab42-0187c241bf4a/2023-01-corso-guide-of-parametric-insurance.pdf\">parametric insurance mechanisms</a>. It pays out before storms hit, not months later, so countries are ready to respond to the damage.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gca.org/critical-need-for-loss-and-damage-fund-to-help-sids-cope-with-climate-change/\">current international disaster finance system</a>, controlled by global lenders and donors, requires countries <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/how-disaster-relief-and-response-work/\">to prove their losses after a disaster in order to access assistance</a>, often resulting in months of delay. “Proof” is established by formal evaluations or inspections, such as by the United Nations, and aid is released only after meeting certain requirements. This process can stall recovery at the moment when aid is needed the most.</p>\n\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n\n<p>The Caribbean needs a system that provides support before disasters strike, with agreed-upon funding commitments and regional risk-pooling mechanisms that can avoid the delays and bureaucratic burden that slow recovery.</p>\n\n<p>What’s happening in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti today is a glimpse of what’s coming for coastal and island communities worldwide as climate change accelerates. In my view, we can either learn from the Caribbean’s experiences and redesign disaster recovery now or wait until the trap closes around everyone.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268641/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Farah Nibbs does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In computing, some have proclaimed that “a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-01273-w\">year in machine learning</a> is a century in any other field.” But how do you know whether those advancements are hype or reality?</p>\n\n<p>Failures quickly multiply when there’s a deluge of new technology, especially when these developments haven’t been properly tested or fully understood. Even technological innovations from trusted labs and organizations sometimes result in spectacular failures. Think of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/\">IBM Watson</a>, an AI program the company hailed as a revolutionary tool for cancer treatment in 2011. However, rather than evaluating the tool based on patient outcomes, IBM used less relevant measures – possibly even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-00945-9\">irrelevant ones</a>, such as expert ratings rather than patient outcomes. As a result, IBM Watson not only failed to offer doctors reliable and innovative treatment recommendations, it also <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/25/ibm-watson-recommended-unsafe-incorrect-treatments/\">suggested harmful ones</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/ChatGPT\">ChatGPT was released</a> in November 2022, interest in AI <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-01-01%202025-10-18&amp;geo=US&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en\">expanded rapidly</a> across industry <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02980-0\">and in science</a> alongside ballooning <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-ai-dominance-inevitable-a-technology-ethicist-says-no-actually-240088\">claims of its efficacy</a>. But as the vast majority of companies are seeing their <a href=\"https://futurism.com/ai-agents-failing-companies\">attempts at incorporating generative AI fail</a>, questions about whether the technology does what developers promised are coming to the fore.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Black screen with IBM Watson logo on a Jeopardy stand with $1,200 stood between two contestants with $0 each\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700626/original/file-20251105-56-sq8c99.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=504&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">IBM Watson wowed on Jeopardy, but not in the clinic.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/Jeopardy-TopWinners/c65add11f4d146738a4d63a8883fc2e8/photo\">AP Photo/Seth Wenig</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In a world of rapid technological change, a pressing question arises: How can people determine whether a new technological marvel genuinely works and is safe to use? </p>\n\n<p>Borrowing from the language of science, this question is really <a href=\"https://misq.umn.edu/misq/article/doi/10.25300/MISQ/2024/18064/3273/Validity-in-Design-Science\">about validity</a> – that is, the soundness, trustworthiness and dependability of a claim. Validity is the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.17705/1jais.00594\">ultimate verdict</a> of whether a scientific claim accurately reflects reality. Think of it as quality control for science: It helps researchers know whether a medication really cures a disease, a health-tracking app truly improves fitness, or a model of a black hole genuinely describes how it behaves in space.</p>\n\n<p>How to evaluate validity for new technologies and innovations has been unclear, in part because science has mostly focused on validating claims about the natural world. </p>\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_qBDX98AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">work as researchers</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t0ysd44AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">who study how to</a> evaluate science across disciplines, we developed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09466\">framework to assess the validity</a> of any design, be it a new technology or policy. We believe setting clear and consistent standards for validity and learning how to assess it can empower people to make informed decisions about technology – and determine whether a new technology will truly deliver on its promise.</p>\n\n<h2>Validity is the bedrock of knowledge</h2>\n\n<p>Historically, validity was primarily concerned with ensuring the precision of scientific measurements, such as whether a thermometer correctly measures temperature or a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.09723\">psychological test accurately assesses anxiety</a>. Over time, it became clear that there is more than just one kind of validity. </p>\n\n<p>Different scientific fields <a href=\"https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/validity-in-educational-and-psychological-assessment/book239005\">have their own ways of evaluating validity</a>. Engineers test new designs against safety and performance standards. Medical researchers use controlled experiments to verify treatments are more effective than existing options. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers across fields use <a href=\"https://people.tamu.edu/%7Ew-arthur/204/15A/PSYC%20204%2015A%20lecture%20notes,%20Topic%2002,%20Research%20Validity.pdf\">different types of validity</a>, depending on the kind of claim they’re making. </p>\n\n<p>Internal validity asks whether the relationship between two variables is truly causal. A medical researcher, for instance, might run a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-clinical-trial-a-health-policy-expert-explains-137221\">randomized controlled trial</a> to be sure that a new drug led patients to recover rather than some other factor such as the placebo effect. </p>\n\n<p>External validity is about generalization – whether those results would still hold outside the lab or in a broader or different population. An example of low external validity is how many early studies that work in mice <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/expanding-alzheimers-research-with-primates-could-overcome-the-problem-with-treatments-that-show-promise-in-mice-but-dont-help-humans-188207\">don’t always translate</a> to people.</p>\n\n<p>Construct validity, on the other hand, is about meaning. Psychologists and social scientists rely on it when they ask whether a test or survey really captures the idea it’s supposed to measure. Does a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2021.103736\">grit scale</a> actually reflect perseverance or just stubbornness? </p>\n\n<p>Finally, ecological validity asks whether something works in the real world rather than just under ideal lab conditions. A behavioral model or AI system might perform brilliantly in simulation but fail once human behavior, noisy data or institutional complexity enter the picture. </p>\n\n<p>Across all these types of validity, the goal is the same: ensuring that scientific tools – from lab experiments to algorithms – connect faithfully to the reality they aim to explain.</p>\n\n<h2>Evaluating technology claims</h2>\n\n<p>We developed a method to help researchers across disciplines clearly test the reliability and effectiveness of their inventions and theories. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09466\">design science validity framework</a> identifies three critical kinds of claims researchers usually make about the utility of a technology, innovation, theory, model or method.</p>\n\n<p>First, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09466\">criterion claim</a> asserts that a discovery delivers beneficial outcomes, typically by outperforming current standards. These claims justify the technology’s utility by showing clear advantages over existing alternatives. </p>\n\n<p>For example, developers of generative AI models such as ChatGPT may see higher engagement with the technology the more it flatters and agrees with the user. As a result, they may program the technology to be more affirming – a feature <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-92611-2_5\">called sycophancy</a> – in order to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.01395\">increase user retention</a>. The AI models meet the criterion claim of users considering them <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.01395\">more flattering than talking to people</a>. However, this does little to improve the technology’s efficacy in tasks such as helping resolve <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/do-you-talk-to-ai-when-youre-feeling-down-heres-where-chatbots-get-their-therapy-advice-257732\">mental health issues</a> or relationship problems. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5-mnu2BDGk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">AI sycophancy can lead users to break relationships rather than repair them.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Second, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09466\">causal claim</a> addresses how specific components or features of a technology directly contribute to its success or failure. In other words, it is a claim that shows researchers know what makes a technology effective and exactly why it works.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at AI models and excessive flattery, researchers found that interacting with more sycophantic models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.01395\">reduced users’ willingness to repair</a> interpersonal conflict and increased their conviction of being in the right. The causal claim here is that the AI feature of sycophancy reduces a user’s desire to repair conflict. </p>\n\n<p>Third, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09466\">context claim</a> specifies where and under what conditions a technology is expected to function effectively. These claims explore whether the benefits of a technology or system generalize beyond the lab and can reach other populations and settings. </p>\n\n<p>In the same study, researchers examined how excessive flattery affected user actions in other datasets, including the “Am I the Asshole” community on Reddit. They found that AI models were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.01395\">more affirming of user decisions</a> than people were, even when the user was describing manipulative or harmful behavior. This supports the context claim that sycophantic behavior from an AI model applies across different conversational contexts and populations.</p>\n\n<h2>Measuring validity as a consumer</h2>\n\n<p>Understanding the validity of scientific innovations and consumer technologies is critical for scientists and the general public. For scientists, it’s a road map to ensure their inventions are rigorously evaluated. And for the public, it means knowing that the tools and systems they depend on – such as health apps, medications and financial platforms – are truly safe, effective and beneficial. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s how you can use validity to understand the scientific and technological innovations happening around you.</p>\n\n<p>Because it is difficult to compare every feature of two technologies against each other, focus on which features you value most from a technology or model. For example, do you prefer a chatbot to be accurate or better for privacy? Examine claims for it in that area, and check that it is as good as claimed. </p>\n\n<p>Consider not only the types of claims made for a technology but also which claims are not made. For example, does a chatbot company address bias in its model? It’s your key to knowing whether you see untested and potentially unsafe hype or a genuine advancement.</p>\n\n<p>By understanding validity, organizations and consumers can cut through the hype and get to the truth behind the latest technologies.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259030/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

I look forward to familiar traditions with friends and family, eggnog in my coffee, and the sense that everyone is feeling a little lighter and more connected. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I feel anxious and annoyed by the manufactured sense of urgency around gift giving: the endless searching and second-guessing shaped by advertisers, retailers and cultural expectations. </p>\n\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I mostly love giving – and, yes, receiving – gifts during the holidays. But as <a href=\"https://mason.wm.edu/faculty/directory/luchs-m.php\">a researcher who studies consumer psychology</a>, I see how those same forces, amplified by constant buying opportunities and <a href=\"https://stripe.com/resources/more/frictionless-payments-101\">frictionless online payments</a>, make us especially vulnerable and often unwise this time of year. </p>\n\n<p>Buying behavior, including gift giving, doesn’t just reflect needs and wants but also our values. Frequently, the values we talk about are more akin to aspirational ideals. Our actual values are revealed in the seemingly inconsequential choices we make day after day – including shopping.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA/%22\">cumulative effects of our spending behaviors</a> carry enormous implications for society, the environment and everyone’s well-being – from the purchaser and recipient to people working throughout the supply chain. This makes consumer behavior an especially important place to apply the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/HRP.0000000000000205\">emerging social science research on wisdom</a>. While wisdom is defined in different ways, it can be understood as seeing decisions through a broader, values-informed perspective and acting in ways that promote well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, consumer psychology researcher <a href=\"https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/faculty/dgm9t\">David Mick</a> and I <a href=\"https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1037\">have studied</a> what that means when it comes to consumption. “Consumer wisdom?” you may wonder. Isn’t that an oxymoron? </p>\n\n<p>But there are vast differences in how we consume – and as our research shows, this can lead to very different effects on individual well-being. </p>\n\n<h2>Defining consumer wisdom</h2>\n\n<p>Building on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014829631100066X\">some of David’s earlier work</a>, I began my own research on consumer wisdom in the summer of 2015, interviewing dozens of people across the U.S. whom others in their communities had identified as models of wisdom. Previous research guided me to settings where I could easily find people who represented different aspects of wisdom: practicality on farms in upstate New York; environmental stewardship in Portland, Oregon; and community values in Tidewater, Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t use the term “wisdom,” though. It can be intimidating, and people often define it narrowly.

With the help of <a href=\"https://news.vanderbilt.edu/experts/expertprofile/?expert_username=kelly.haws\">a third co-author, Kelly Haws</a>, we validated this framework through <a href=\"https://professorluchs.com/\">national surveys</a> with thousands of participants, creating <a href=\"https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1224\">the consumer wisdom scale</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The scale shows how consumer wisdom is not some lofty ideal but a set of practical habits. Some are about managing money. Some are about goals and personal philosophy, and others are about broader impact. </p>\n\n<p>We have found that six dimensions capture the vast majority of what we would call consumer wisdom:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Responsibility: managing resources to support a rewarding yet realistic lifestyle.</li>\n<li> Purpose: prioritizing spending that supports personal growth, health and relationships.</li>\n<li> Perspective: drawing on past experiences and anticipating future consequences.</li>\n<li> Reasoning: seeking and applying reliable, relevant information; filtering out the noise of advertising and pop culture.</li>\n<li> Flexibility: being open to alternatives such as borrowing, renting or buying used.</li>\n<li> Sustainability: spending in ways that support the buyer’s social or environmental goals and values.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are not abstract traits. They are everyday ways of <a href=\"https://professorluchs.com/\">aligning your spending with your goals, resources and values</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, people with higher scores on the scale <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1224\">report greater life satisfaction</a>, as well as better health, financial security and sense of meaning in life. These results hold even after accounting for known determinants of well-being, such as job satisfaction and supportive relationships. In other words, consumer wisdom makes a distinctive and underappreciated contribution to well-being. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man and woman who appear to be in the 60s or 70s pause and look at a product as they push a grocery cart through a market.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700149/original/file-20251104-56-wdbhz7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">One tenet of consumer wisdom is sustainability: Does your purchase support the world you want to live in?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/senior-couple-choosing-the-groceries-to-buy-at-royalty-free-image/1334510124?phrase=grocery%20store%20discussion&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Luis Alvarez/Digital Vision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Putting it in practice</h2>\n\n<p>These six dimensions offer a different lens on holiday norms – one that can reframe how to think about gifts. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the English word “gift” traces back to <a href=\"https://asa-samfundet.se/en/proto-norse-futhark-elder-futhark/the-rune-gifu-gebo-gebu/\">the Old Norse rune gyfu</a>, which means generosity. It’s a reminder that true giving is not about checking boxes on referral, revenue-generating gift guides or yielding to slick promotions or fads. Generosity is about focusing on another person’s well-being and our relationship with them. </p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of consumer wisdom, that means asking what will genuinely contribute to the recipient’s life. One of the most important dimensions of consumer wisdom is “purpose”: the idea that thoughtful spending can nurture personal growth, health, enjoyment and sense of connection. Out with trendy gadgets, fast fashion and clutter-creating décor or knickknacks – things that feel exciting in the moment but are quickly forgotten. In with quality headphones, a shared cooking class, a board game, and a workshop or tools to support a hobby – gifts that can spark growth, joy and deeper connection. </p>\n\n<p>In my ongoing research, people have described wise gifts as those that define value from the recipient’s perspective – gifts that stay meaningful and useful over time. The wisest gifts, respondents say, also affirm the recipient’s identity, showing that the giver truly understands and values them. </p>\n\n<p>Wiser consumption is learnable, measurable and consequential. By choosing gifts that reflect purpose and the original spirit of “gyfu” – true generosity – we can make the holidays less stressful. More importantly, we can make them more meaningful: strengthening relationships in ways that bring joy long after.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265564/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Michael Luchs received funding from the Templeton Foundation through a grant from the University of Chicago School of Divinity.</span></em></p>",

Parmenides of Elea was a Greek philosopher of the sixth to fifth centuries BCE. <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-brief-history-of-the-philosophy-of-time-9780197684108\">Parmenides wondered</a>, if the future is not yet and the past is not anymore, how could events pass from future to present to past? </p>\n\n<p>He reasoned that, if the future is real, then it is real now; and, if what is real now is only what is present, the future is not real. So, if the future is not real, then the occurrence of any present event is a case of something inexplicably coming from nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Parmenides wasn’t the only skeptic about time. Similar reasoning regarding contradictions inherent in the way we talk about time appears in <a href=\"https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html\">Aristotle</a>, in the ancient Hindu school known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=U2fmDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">Advaita Vedanta</a> and in the work of <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3296/3296-h/3296-h.htm\">Augustine of Hippo</a>, also known as St. Augustine, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<h2>Einstein and relativity</h2>\n\n<p>The early modern physicist Isaac Newton <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Principia.html?id=2u_DBAAAQBAJ\">had presumed</a> an unperceived yet real flow of time. To Newton, time is a dynamic physical phenomenon that exists in the background, a regular, ticking universe-clock in terms of which one can objectively describe all motions and accelerations. </p>\n\n<p>Then, Albert Einstein came along.</p>\n\n<p>In 1905 and 1915, Einstein proposed his <a href=\"https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html\">special</a> and <a href=\"https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html\">general theories of relativity</a>, respectively. These theories validated all those long-running suspicions about the very concept of time and change. </p>\n\n<p>Relativity rejects Newton’s notion about time as a universal physical phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>By Einstein’s era, researchers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment\">had shown</a> that the speed of light is a constant, regardless of the velocity of the source. To take this fact seriously, he argued, is to take all object velocities to be relative. </p>\n\n<p>Nothing is ever really at rest or really in motion; it all depends on your “<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/\">frame of reference</a>.” A frame of reference determines the spatial and temporal coordinates a given observer will assign to objects and events, on the assumption that he or she is at rest relative to everything else. </p>\n\n<p>Someone floating in space sees a spaceship going by to the right. But the universe itself is completely neutral on whether the observer is at rest and the ship is moving to the right, or if the ship is at rest with the observer moving to the left. </p>\n\n<p>This notion affects our understanding of what clocks actually do. Because the speed of light is a constant, two observers moving relative to each other will assign different times to different events. </p>\n\n<p>In a famous example, two equidistant lightning strikes occur simultaneously for an observer at a train station who can see both at once. An observer on the train, moving toward one lightning strike and away from the other, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9FY2NGIUM8\">will assign different times</a> to the strikes. This is because one observer is moving away from the light coming from one strike and toward the light coming from the other. The other observer is stationary relative to the lightning strikes, so the respective light from each reaches him at the same time. Neither is right or wrong.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9FY2NGIUM8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a famous example of relativity, observers assign different times to two lightning strikes happening simultaneously.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>How much time elapses between events, and what time something happens, <a href=\"https://web.pa.msu.edu/courses/2000fall/phy232/lectures/relativity/dilation.html\">depends on the observer’s frame of reference</a>. Observers moving relative to each other will, at any given moment, disagree on what events are happening now; events that are happening now according to one observer’s reckoning at any given moment will lie in the future for another observer, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Under relativity, all times are equally real. Everything that has ever happened or ever will happen is happening now for a hypothetical observer. There are no events that are either merely potential or a mere memory. There is no single, absolute, universal present, and thus there is no flow of time as events supposedly “become” present. </p>\n\n<p>Change just means that the situation is different at different times. At any moment, I remember certain things. At later moments, I remember more. That’s all there is to the passage of time. This doctrine, widely accepted today among both physicists and philosophers, is <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/eternalism/\">known as “eternalism</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to a pivotal question: If there is no such thing as the passage of time, why does everyone seem to think that there is?</p>\n\n<h2>Time as a psychological projection</h2>\n\n<p>One common option has been to suggest that the passage of time is an “illusion” – exactly as Einstein <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Stubbornly_Persistent_Illusion/sV8gdLunYo8C\">famously described it</a> at one point.</p>\n\n<p>Calling the passage of time “illusory” misleadingly suggests that our belief in the passage of time is a result of misperception, as though it were some sort of optical illusion. But I think it’s more accurate to think of this belief as resulting from misconception. </p>\n\n<p>As I propose in my book “<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-brief-history-of-the-philosophy-of-time-9780197684108\">A Brief History of the Philosophy of Time</a>,” our sense of the passage of time is an example of psychological projection – a type of cognitive error that involves misconceiving the nature of your own experience.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/color/\">classic example is color</a>. A red rose is not really red, per se. Rather, the rose reflects light at a certain wavelength, and a visual experience of this wavelength may give rise to a feeling of redness. My point is that the rose is neither really red nor does it convey the illusion of redness. </p>\n\n<p>The red visual experience is just a matter of how we process objectively true facts about the rose. It’s not a mistake to identify a rose by its redness; the rose enthusiast isn’t making a deep claim about the nature of color itself. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, my research suggests that the passage of time is neither real nor an illusion: <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/passage-of-time-is-not-an-illusion-its-a-projection/2127B228E79AD102BCEE319813FDF72D\">It’s a projection</a> based on how people make sense of the world. I can’t really describe the world without the passage of time any more than I can describe my visual experience of the world without referencing the color of objects. </p>\n\n<p>I can say that my GPS “thinks” I took a wrong turn without really committing myself to my GPS being a conscious, thinking being. My GPS has no mind, and thus no mental map of the world, yet I am not wrong in understanding its output as a valid representation of my location and my destination. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, even though physics leaves no room for the dynamic passage of time, time is effectively dynamic to me as far as my experience of the world is concerned. </p>\n\n<p>The passage of time is inextricably bound up with how humans represent our own experiences. Our picture of the world is inseparable from the conditions under which we, as perceivers and thinkers, experience and understand the world. Any description of reality we come up with will unavoidably be infused with our perspective. The error lies in confusing our perspective on reality with reality itself.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266634/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adrian Bardon does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

More importantly, we see ways humanity can improve health by tackling climate change. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a look at the risks and some of the steps individuals and governments can take to reduce them.</p>\n\n<h2>Extreme heat</h2>\n\n<p>Greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources <a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/question746.htm\">accumulate in the atmosphere, trapping heat</a> and holding it close to Earth’s surface like a blanket. Too much of it causes global temperatures to rise, leaving more people exposed to dangerous heat more often.</p>\n\n<p>Most people who get minor heat illnesses will recover, but more extreme exposure, especially without enough hydration and a way to cool off, can be fatal. People who work outside, are elderly or have underlying illnesses such as heart, lung or kidney diseases are often at the greatest risk.</p>\n\n<p>Heat deaths have been rising globally, <a href=\"https://lancetcountdown.org/explore-our-data/\">up 23%</a> from the 1990s to the 2010s, when the average year saw more than half a million heat-related deaths. Even in the U.S., the Pacific Northwest heat dome in 2021 killed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/11/climate/deaths-pacific-northwest-heat-wave.html\">hundreds of people</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"CYdz7\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CYdz7/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2305427120\">Climate scientists predict</a> that with advancing climate change, many areas of the world, including U.S. cities such as <a href=\"https://climatecheck.com/florida/miami\">Miami</a>, <a href=\"https://climatecheck.com/texas/houston\">Houston</a>, <a href=\"https://climatecheck.com/arizona/phoenix\">Phoenix</a> and <a href=\"https://climatecheck.com/nevada/las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a>, will confront many more days each year hot enough to threaten human survival.</p>\n\n<h2>Extreme weather</h2>\n\n<p>Warmer air holds more moisture, so climate change brings increasing rainfall and storm intensity, worsening flooding, as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/two-key-ingredients-cause-extreme-storms-with-destructive-flooding-why-these-downpours-are-happening-more-often-254123\">many U.S. communities have experienced</a> in recent years. Warm ocean water also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42669-y\">fuels more powerful hurricanes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Increased flooding carries health risks, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58236-0\">including drownings, electrocution</a> and water contamination from human pathogens and toxic chemicals.

That’s much farther than the <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g32634624/ev-longest-driving-range/\">longest-range electric vehicles on the U.S. market</a>, according to Car and Driver magazine – and twice as far the official rating for the <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a62446256/2024-tesla-model-3-long-range-rwd-test/\">long-range, rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3</a>, which has a maximum rated range of 363 miles.</p>\n\n<p>Current EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are also found in smartphones, laptops and even <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/electricity/grid-scale-storage\">large-scale energy storage systems</a> connected to the power grid. A standard for decades, these batteries have been tweaked and improved by generations of scientists and are now <a href=\"https://www.large-battery.com/blog/theoretical-energy-limits-lithium-batteries/\">close to their physical limits</a>. Even with the best materials and most optimized designs, there is only so much energy that can be packed into a lithium-ion battery. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://www.jalilvandlab.com/\">materials engineer</a> who studies these batteries and seeks alternatives with better performance, improved environmental sustainability and lower cost. One promising design uses sulfur, which could boost battery capacity significantly, though some key roadblocks remain before it can be widely used. </p>\n\n<h2>Lithium-sulfur vs. Lithium-ion</h2>\n\n<p>Any battery has <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/education/celebrating-chemistry-editions/2024-ccew/the-anatomy-of-a-battery.html\">three basic components</a>: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.</p>\n\n<p>In a lithium-ion battery, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nanoenergyadv3020008\">cathode is made of a metal oxide</a>, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2020.12.027\">anode is usually graphite</a>, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A schematic diagram of the inner workings of a lithium-sulfur battery.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700619/original/file-20251105-56-4e6ls6.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=841&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Lithium-sulfur batteries like this one have different chemistry than more commonly known lithium-ion batteries.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Li-S_battery_EN.png\">Egibe via Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.</p>\n\n<p>During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where – rather than sliding in between the cathode layers – they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.</p>\n\n<p>The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202202094\">involves more electrons</a> than the <a href=\"https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/stem-explained/how-does-a-lithium-ion-battery-work\">same process in lithium-ion batteries</a>. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201606823\">store much more energy</a> than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/mineral-resource-month-sulfur/#google_vignette\">Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide</a>, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has <a href=\"https://www.humanium.org/en/the-current-state-of-child-labour-in-cobalt-mines-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/\">limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.</p>\n\n<h2>Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?</h2>\n\n<p>The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before <a href=\"https://www.ecoflow.com/us/blog/how-long-do-lithium-batteries-last\">its capacity starts to fade</a>. That amounts to thousands of car rides.</p>\n\n<p>But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201801188\">fewer than 100 cycles</a>. That’s not very many trips at all.</p>\n\n<p>The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2025.104600\">liquid electrolyte of the battery</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2025.104600\">fewer elements available to release and store energy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity <a href=\"https://eta.lbl.gov/news/56320/sulfur-graphene-oxide-material-for-lithium-sulfur-battery-cathodes\">within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles</a>, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.</p>\n\n<p>New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08298-9\">after thousands of cycles</a>. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.</p>\n\n<p>The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b10641\">physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides</a>, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.</p>\n\n<h2>The road ahead</h2>\n\n<p>Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a <a href=\"https://www.faraday.ac.uk/lis-advantages/\">less volatile cathode</a> than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2024.109265\">chemical reactions involved are more intense</a> with increased energy.</p>\n\n<p>This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-benefits\">high energy capacity and long cycle life</a>, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263896/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Golareh Jalilvand receives funding from NantG Power LLC, and the US Department of Energy for research on lithium-sulfur batteries.</span></em></p>",

Hosting “Saturday Night Live,” he embraced the controversy, defending his heritage and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Pt7qHpWNg&amp;t=6s\">answering his critics in Spanish before declaring</a>, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”</p>\n\n<p>By the time NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell <a href=\"https://x.com/MAGAVoice/status/1981244553777860920\">addressed the backlash</a>, the outrage had already served its purpose. The story had become another front in the culture war between left and right, complete with nationalism, identity politics, media spectacle and performative anger.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a8wEtkYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a researcher of propaganda</a>, I’ve spent the past three years tracking these cycles of outrage across social platforms and partisan media, studying how they hijack the national conversation and spill into local politics. My recent book, “<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Populism-Propaganda-and-Political-Extremism-Building-the-Rage-Machine/Klein/p/book/9781032942049\">\"Populism, Propaganda, and Political Extremism,”</a> is guided by a single question: How much of our political outrage is really our own?</p>\n\n<h2>Outrage before the event</h2>\n\n<p>Culture wars have long shaped American politics, from battles over <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/gun-debate-culture-debate\">gun rights</a> to disputes over <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2019/10/03/religion-in-the-public-schools-2019-update/\">prayer in schools</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-culture-wars-push-students-form-banned-book/story?id=103377259\">book bans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/exploring-the-efforts-to-control-how-u-s-history-is-presented-in-museums-and-monuments\">historical monuments</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/08/09/culture-wars-james-davison-hunter-politics\">Sociologist James Davison Hunter</a> coined the term “culture wars” to describe a recurring struggle, not just over social issues but over “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/20/culture-war-politics-2021-democracy-analysis-489900\">the meaning of America</a>.” These battles once arose from spontaneous events that struck a cultural nerve. An American flag is set ablaze, and citizens quickly take sides as the political world responds in kind.</p>\n\n<p>But today that order has reversed. Culture wars now begin in the political sector, where professional partisans <a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2024/05/06/kansas-gop-leaders-follow-bannons-advice-for-manipulating-media-flood-the-zone-with-s/\">introduce them</a> into the public discourse, then watch them take hold. They’re marketed to media audiences as storylines, designed to spark outrage and turn disengaged voters into angry ones.</p>\n\n<p>One clear sign that outrage is being manufactured is when the backlash begins long before the designated “controversial event” even occurs.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, American audiences were <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/disney-lightyear-anti-lgbtq-panic?srsltid=AfmBOorZ-cgfxX_antarwdI7koxVhinYQJN9GbnhU6Jp-PVB_aiLgW4z\">urged by conservative influencers</a> to condemn Pixar’s film “Lightyear” months before it reached theaters. A same-sex kiss turned the film into a vessel for accusations of Hollywood’s “<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2022/06/17/ted-cruz-slams-woke-disney-for-pushing-gay-agenda-in-pixars-buzz-lightyear-movie/\">culture agenda</a>.” Driven by partisan efforts, the outrage spread online, mixing with darker elements and eventually culminating in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/neo-nazi-groups-spew-hate-disney-world-orlando-officials-say-rcna103186\">neo-Nazi protests</a> outside Disney World.</p>\n\n<p>This primed outrage appears across the political spectrum. </p>\n\n<p>Last spring, when President Donald Trump announced a military parade in Washington, leading Democrats quickly framed it as an unmistakable <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5289715-tim-walz-donald-trump-authoritarianism/\">show of authoritarianism</a>. By the time the parade arrived months later, it was met with dueling <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kings-day-protests-us-counter-trumps-military-parade/story?id=122813898\">“No Kings” demonstrations across the country</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And when HBO host Bill Maher said in March that he would be dining with Trump, the comedian faced a <a href=\"https://x.com/WalshFreedom/status/1903202402171232760\">preemptive backlash</a>, which escalated into vocal criticism from the <a href=\"https://san.com/cc/bill-maher-brushes-off-liberal-critics-ahead-of-trump-meeting/\">political left</a> before either of the men raised a fork.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A theater billboard promotes LGBTQIA+ rights and a movie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=539&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=539&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701514/original/file-20251110-56-ogq3k8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=539&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles promotes LGBTQIA+ Pride Month and Pixar’s ‘Lightyear’ on June 21, 2022.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/general-views-of-the-disneys-el-capitan-theatre-promoting-news-photo/1241444248?adppopup=true\">AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Today, few things are marketed as aggressively as political anger, as seen in the recent firestorm against Bad Bunny. It’s promoted daily through <a href=\"https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1974139293720580479\">podcasts</a>, hashtags, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPjwA2XDvLR/\">memes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/81260094-bad-bunny-haters-unite?countrycode=US&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=%5BG%5D+%5BG.NAM%5D+%5BL.ENG%5D+%5BGEN%5D+%5BC.TShirts%5D+%5BPLF%5D&amp;utm_id=notset&amp;utm_content=donald+trump#321P81260094D1V\">merchandise</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, these fiery narratives originate not in politics but in popular culture, providing an enticing hook for stories about the left’s <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/25/disney-plus-adria-arjona-andor-star-wars-prequel-woke/\">control over culture</a> or the right’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/jason-aldean-country-music-luke-combs/674952/\">claims to real America</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months alone, outrage among America’s polarized political bases has flared over a Cracker Barrel <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bot-networks-are-helping-drag-consumer-brands-into-the-culture-wars-63dffa04\">logo change</a>, “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/superman-movie-james-gunn-slammed-as-woke-rcna217653\">woke Superman</a>,” Sydney Sweeney’s <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/08/11/the-self-sustaining-outrage-cycle-of-sydney-sweeneys-jeans-ad/\">American Eagle ad</a> and, with Bad Bunny, the NFL’s <a href=\"https://www.musictimes.com/articles/110277/20251029/jay-z-calls-out-fake-outrage-over-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show.htm\">Super Bowl performer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Platforms like X and TikTok deliver the next diatribes, amplified by partisan influencers and spread by algorithms. From there, they become national stories, often marked by headlines promising the latest “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/10/29/sports/sydney-sweeneys-world-series-cameo-sparks-a-liberal-meltdown/\">liberal meltdown</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2025/07/21/magas-tantrum-over-woke-superman-is-nastier-than-their-usual-whining/\">MAGA tantrum</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But manufactured outrage doesn’t stop at the national level. It surfaces in local politics, where these stories play out in protests and town halls.</p>\n\n<h2>The local echo</h2>\n\n<p>I wanted to understand how these narratives reach communities and how politically active citizens see themselves within this cycle. Over the past year, I <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781003569459-5/tribalism-perspectives-side-adam-klein?context=ubx&amp;refId=e605b734-bd9e-4abe-8d84-5247c4fcd0d6\">interviewed</a> liberal and conservative activists, beginning in my hometown, where <a href=\"https://tbrnewsmedia.com/north-shore-residents-divided-on-presidents-day/\">opposing protesters</a> have faced off every Saturday for two decades.</p>\n\n<p>Their signs echo the same narratives that dominate national politics: warnings about the left’s “woke agenda” and charges of “Trump fascism.” When asked about the opposition, protesters reached for familiar caricatures. Conservatives often described the left as “radical” and “socialist,” while those on the left saw the right as “cultlike” and “extremist.” </p>\n\n<p>Yet beneath the anger, both sides recognized something larger at play – the sense that outrage itself is being engineered. “The media constantly fan the flames of division for more views,” one protester said. Across the street, his counterpart agreed: “Politics is being pushed into previously nonpolitical areas.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A sign promoting a restaurant appears next to a highway.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701515/original/file-20251110-56-qcfuqc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When Cracker Barrel attempted to change its logo in August 2025, the move was met by severe criticism from loyal customers who preferred the brand’s traditional image.

The loudest voice gets the most coverage.”</p>\n\n<p>“It’s been a crazy few years, moving further to the extremes, and tensions are always rising,” one protester reflected. “But I think people are realizing that now.”</p>\n\n<p>Across the divide, protesters understood that they were participants in something larger than their weekly standoffs, a system that converts every political difference into a national spectacle. They saw it, resented it and yet couldn’t escape it.</p>\n\n<p>That brings us back to Bad Bunny. The anger that Americans are encouraged to feel over his selection – or in defense of it – keeps the country locked in its corners. Studies show that as a result of these cycles, Americans on the left and right have developed an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001263117\">exaggerated sense</a> of the other side’s hostility, exactly as some <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/11/how-demagogues-wield-social-media/\">political demagogues</a> intend.</p>\n\n<p>It has created a split screen of the country, literally in the case of Bad Bunny. On Super Bowl night, there will be dueling halftime shows. On one screen, Bad Bunny will perform for approving viewers. On the other, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/charlie-kirk-talked-with-young-people-at-universities-for-a-reason-he-wanted-american-education-to-return-to-traditional-values-265190\">the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA</a> will host its “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/10/09/us-news/turning-point-usa-to-air-its-own-all-american-super-bowl-lx-halftime-show-to-compete-with-nfls-bad-bunny/\">All-American Halftime Show</a>” for those intent on tuning Bad Bunny out.</p>\n\n<p>Two screens.

A significant number of Americans <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/americans-challenges-with-health-care-costs/\">have trouble affording health care</a>, even if they do have insurance. The tax and spending package signed by President Donald Trump into law in July 2025 puts a further 16 million Americans at risk of <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1ef7782a-f4d2-4b62-9f83-869384e3edeb/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-state-by-state-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf\">losing their health care insurance by 2034</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office. </p>\n\n<p>Many people who lack or have insufficient health insurance seek health care from a network of safety net clinics called community health centers. Even though community health centers provide care for <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/community-health-centers/what-is-a-health-center/\">1 in 10 people</a> in the U.S. – and 1 in 5 in rural areas – many people are unaware of their role in the country’s medical system. </p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/medicine_greenville/about/faculty/facultydir/pfac5f03d7422f9d1fff4e2c98f8f78858\">emergency physician</a> and the director of the <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/medicine_greenville/life_on_campus/student_life_and_engagement/community_engagement/root_cause/index.php\">student-led community health program</a> at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Greenville, I collaborate with the community health center in Greenville and am closely familiar with how these types of providers function. </p>\n\n<p>These clinics often operate on razor-thin margins and already function under continual demands to do more with less. Slated cuts to health care spending from the tax and spending bill and funding uncertainties that were driven by the shutdown threaten to destabilize them further.</p>\n\n<h2>What are community health centers?</h2>\n\n<p>Community health centers are clinics typically located in low-income areas that provide affordable health care to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. Their history is <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/about-nachc/history-of-chc/\">rooted in the Civil Rights Movement</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In 1964, as activists traveled through the South to register Black voters, a group of doctors, nurses and social workers that <a href=\"https://www.crmvet.org/docs/mchr.htm\">called themselves the Medical Committee for Human Rights</a> formed to provide emergency first aid and to support civil rights workers, volunteers and the local communities they engaged with. </p>\n\n<p>Witnessing how intimately poor health in some of these communities was tied to living in conditions of extreme poverty, the group embraced the mission of providing health care as a way to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/01/28/health-care-was-central-civil-rights-movement/\">fight the injustice of racism</a>. Their idea was that treating illnesses and chronic conditions that stemmed from poverty would enable people to rise out of poverty and shape their own destiny. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9AWpRLQ0RXo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Federally funded community health centers have their roots in the Civil Rights Movement.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The original community health centers were called <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/about-nachc/history-of-chc/\">Neighborhood Health Centers</a>, and the first two – one in Boston and the other in Mississippi – opened in 1966. They were funded as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/War-on-Poverty\">War on Poverty</a>, which introduced <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022050714000291\">legislation that launched safety net programs</a>, including Medicare and Medicaid, designed to support Americans experiencing economic hardships. </p>\n\n<p>Community health centers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/01/28/health-care-was-central-civil-rights-movement\">quickly multiplied over the following decades</a> and became a cornerstone of the U.S. health care system. These health centers took a broad approach to patient care, focusing on preventive  nutrition and health education. They also sought to help with challenges that weren’t strictly medical but also affect people’s health, such as language barriers, lack of transportation and housing insecurity. </p>\n\n<h2>Different types of community health centers</h2>\n\n<p>Most community health centers <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FQHC-Payment-Guide.pdf\">receive the majority of their funding</a> from the federal government. These clinics, called Federally Qualified Health Centers, must fulfill some specific requirements.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, they must be <a href=\"https://govfacts.org/federal/hhs/community-health-centers-your-guide-to-affordable-accessible-healthcare/\">strategically located to be accessible</a> to people in low-income communities with fewer available medical professionals. They must also minimize other barriers to care – for example, by providing language interpreters and offering telehealth services if appropriate. Additionally, they must be governed by a board in which at least 51% of the members are people who live in the local community.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, such clinics <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/policy-advocacy/health-center-funding/federal-grant-funding/\">received over US$5.6 billion </a> in federal funding. In addition to direct federal government support, they often <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/community-health-center-patients-financing-and-services/\">rely on reimbursements from Medicaid</a> to cover their costs. Some also receive state funding and private funding, as well as money from private insurance of the few patients who do carry it. </p>\n\n<p>People who lack Medicaid or private insurance, or who are underinsured, receive care at no cost if their <a href=\"https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/federal-poverty-guidelines/\">income is below 200% of the poverty level</a>, and on a sliding scale otherwise. </p>\n\n<p>Another type of community health center is often referred to as a “free clinic” or a <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/eligibility-and-registration/health-centers/fqhc-look-alikes\">“look-alike” clinic</a>. These clinics typically rely on private grant funding or charitable donations. They are usually run by volunteers, and they often operate on limited schedules and have limited access to specialists.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, there were more than 1,500 federally funded health clinics providing services in over 17,000 different locations and more than <a href=\"https://nafcclinics.org/free-and-charitable-clinics-served-5-8-million-people-in-2022/\">775 documented free or charitable clinics</a> across the U.S. Together, these two types of community health centers <a href=\"https://www.nachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Overlooked-Decline-Community-Health-Center-Funding_2023_Full-report.pdf\">provide free care to over 30 million people</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lots of people sitting in a health clinic waiting room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701534/original/file-20251110-56-xsqxse.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Community health clinics deliver care at no cost to people whose income is below 200% of the poverty level.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/general-practice-waiting-room-filled-with-patients-royalty-free-image/91559456\">ADAM GAULT/SPL/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The community health project that I direct, <a href=\"https://service.greenvillemed.sc.edu/agency/detail/?agency_id=112856\">called Root Cause</a>, falls into a third category of free safety net health care generally referred to as “pop-up” or makeshift medical clinics. These projects vary widely, but Root Cause, which is run by medical students, operates as a monthly health fair that provides simple screenings for high blood pressure and diabetes as well as education on preventive care and healthy lifestyles. </p>\n\n<p>Pop-up projects like ours are more precarious than other types of community health centers, but through grants and partnerships with organizations in Greenville, we have managed to keep this program funded for eight years. </p>\n\n<h2>Compounding stressors</h2>\n\n<p>Community health centers <a href=\"https://publichealth.gwu.edu/new-analysis-community-health-centers-face-financial-crisis-amid-policy-shifts\">are extremely cost-effective</a>, providing primary care to more than 10% of the U.S. population at the cost of just 1% of the country’s total health care spending. But with <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/health-policy-101-health-care-costs-and-affordability/?entry=table-of-contents-how-has-u-s-health-care-spending-changed-over-time\">health care costs rising</a> and Medicaid and insurance reimbursements failing to keep up, community health centers are increasingly being asked to do more with less. </p>\n\n<p>The 2025 government shutdown added further uncertainty to community health centers’ operations. Although government funding and reimbursements through Medicare and Medicaid continued, having fewer government workers to complete the administrative tasks that these clinics rely on slowed their access to funds.   </p>\n\n<p>In the long term, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/by-the-numbers-harmful-republican-megabill-will-take-health-coverage-away-from\">cuts to Medicaid of up to $1 trillion</a> included in the government’s tax and spending package are likely to decrease community health centers’ funding by limiting Medicaid reimbursements. </p>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, those cuts and other policy changes, such as  <a href=\"https://faspsych.com/blog/navigating-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-impacts-on-medicaid-funding-and-staffing-solutions-for-fqhcs-and-cmhcs/\">new work requirements for Medicaid</a>, are likely to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-17m-americans-enrolled-in-medicaid-and-aca-plans-could-lose-their-health-insurance-by-2034-260664\">strip millions of Americans of health coverage</a> – pushing more people to seek free or low-cost care. Cuts to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-gets-snap-benefits-to-buy-groceries-and-what-the-government-pays-for-the-program-in-5-charts-269032\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits</a> would increase food insecurity as well as stress – both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16040501\">factors that directly affect health</a> – and thus may have the same effect. </p>\n\n<p>Given that community health centers provide a kind of long-term stopgap for health care in high-need areas, decreasing their capacity could destabilize other elements of local health care delivery systems. For example, uninsured people who can’t access care at community health centers may turn to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091625\">already overburdened</a> <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2025/04/viability-of-hospital-based-emergency-care-in-us-faces.html\">hospital emergency rooms</a>, which are <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act/\">required by law to treat them</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As funding cuts imperil health care access, the need for safety net health care only grows. These opposing forces may be putting an untenable strain on a vital service so many Americans rely on.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267582/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jennifer Spinghart does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Leaders of Colorado’s rural schools are more likely to encourage a total stranger to go into teaching than a member of their own family, according to a Colorado-based survey published in October 2025. </p>\n\n<p>The results come at a time when nearly every state in the United States <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/education/teacher-shortage-areas-by-state\">faces critical teacher shortages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We collected data in the fall of 2023 with the goal of describing the perceived strengths and limitations of rural schools in Colorado as understood by the people leading them. We sent an electronic survey to the 146 rural school principals and superintendents in the state, received 100 responses and analyzed 98. </p>\n\n<p>Nearly every respondent mentioned issues related to the declining number of people who want to teach, which also <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/04/04/whats-it-like-to-be-a-teacher-in-america-today/\">reflects national trends</a>. The number of individuals completing educator preparation programs annually in the United States has <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/what-teacher-preparation-enrollment-looks-like-in-charts/2023/08\">declined by more than 200,000 since its high point from 2008 to 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When pressed for additional detail about the primary problems affecting their local schools and districts, more than 85% of respondents identified recruiting and retaining talented teachers as one of the most important issues. This was closely followed by concerns about supporting underprepared and underperforming students and poverty’s effect on student learning.</p>\n\n<h2>The Colorado context</h2>\n\n<p>In Colorado, more than <a href=\"https://cosfp.org/wp-content/uploads/Smallrural-rural-map-2021.pdf\">80% of school districts are rural</a>.

I also worked as an administrator with the Colorado Department of Higher Education from 2013-2016. These  positions have taught me a great deal about the challenges facing smaller schools throughout the state – both in Colorado’s agricultural areas and in the resort regions. Issues related to small budgets, student safety and community poverty are common challenges to schools throughout the state. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://coe.uccs.edu/people/leadership-research-and-foundations/robert-mitchell\">faculty member at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs</a>, I routinely spend extended time at several of these small schools – even serving as a fill-in classroom teacher and principal when needed.</p>\n\n<p>Colorado’s remote and rural schools remain difficult to staff. The salaries offered by these schools are consistently below state averages. Some rural districts have <a href=\"https://www.cde.state.co.us/code/teacher-salary-workbook\">average salaries of $33,000</a>. That’s far below the state average teacher’s salary of $65,838. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the challenges of living in towns that <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/colorado/2025/04/09/low-pay-is-one-reason-rural-schools-struggle-to-hire-teachers-report-says/\">may not have a grocery store</a> or any entertainment options is less appealing to many teachers. That’s especially true for newly certified teachers right out of college.  </p>\n\n<h2>Multiple challenges, with a few bright spots</h2>\n\n<p>Our survey shows some deep concerns from the state’s rural education leaders. Only 2% of rural Colorado education leaders believe their district was very effective in working with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X20931505\">English language learners</a> and students who are performing below grade level. More than 13% of Colorado’s <a href=\"https://www.cde.state.co.us/fedprograms/essastatereports_multilinguallearners\">English language learners are attending school in rural areas</a>, equating to more than 15,000 students. When working with <a href=\"https://www.ruralhealth.us/getmedia/6589dfad-a5f9-494e-b0e8-749f8b60ff68/2022-NRHA-LGBTQ-Policy-Paper-Final-(1).pdf\">LGBTQA+ students</a>, only 3% believed their district was very effective in supporting these students.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://tpre.ecu.edu/index.php/tpre/article/view/921/205\">nearly 60% of school leaders think</a> their district is either effective or very effective in supporting students performing above grade level. Half of these rural educators see their work with supporting homeless or foster students as effective or very effective. </p>\n\n<p>While nearly half of respondents do not have positive feelings about the current state of education in the U.S., 76% are excited about the future of their individual school districts. </p>\n\n<p>Only about 14% believe that schools today are better than at any other time, and nearly 60% reported that they believe American public schools can be fixed only with major changes.</p>\n\n<h2>How to fix rural school challenges</h2>\n\n<p>The school leaders we surveyed are very concerned about the realities associated with finding and keeping qualified teachers in their schools. </p>\n\n<p>We asked respondents to rank a series of <a href=\"https://www.ecs.org/wp-content/uploads/State-Policy-Levers-to-Address-Teacher-Shortages.pdf\">commonly stated solutions</a> related to teachers shortages. The options ranked highest included higher wages for teachers, more respect for the teaching profession, lowering barriers that allow people to become teachers and better benefits.  </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"lOOKX\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lOOKX/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Wealth of experience, depth of doubt</h2>\n\n<p>Despite some bright spots, rural school and district leaders in Colorado are not enthusiastic about the future of American education overall. </p>\n\n<p>Many school districts consistently have <a href=\"https://www.cde.state.co.us/code/educatorshortage-surveyresults\">unfilled positions</a>. Some have resorted to filling vacant classroom positions by hiring retired teachers or long-term substitutes. With fewer educators per school, teacher effectiveness is reduced, reducing overall <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-teacher-shortage-is-real-large-and-growing-and-worse-than-we-thought-the-first-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">student learning</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The results of our study are exceptionally notable to me and my research team because most of the respondents in this study have 15 or more years of K-12 education experience and more than six years of experience as a rural school leader. Going into the project, we thought these dedicated educators would be more positive about the current and future state of American schools. Yet, this does not seem to be the case. </p>\n\n<p>If these leaders are not optimistic, it is difficult to believe that parents or other members of rural communities would feel any differently.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268332/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Mitchell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

During kindergarten, they are more likely to score in the lowest 10% on assessments measuring skills such as letter recognition, vocabulary and recognizing common sight words. Large racial and ethnic differences in the risks for reading difficulties continue as students move through elementary school – a pattern largely explained by family income and early academic skills.</p>\n\n<p>Our study, published online in November 2025 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2025.101504\">in the Journal of School Psychology</a>, finds that about 15% of Black, Hispanic and Native American kindergartners score in the lowest 10% of reading scores, compared to 6% and 8% of white and Asian students, respectively. By fifth grade, 18%, 16% and 10% of Black, Hispanic and Native American students are struggling. The contrasting rate for white and Asian students is about 5%.</p>\n\n<p>We analyzed data collected by the U.S. Department of Education’s <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov\">National Center for Education Statistics</a> from 2010-2016. This data includes direct academic assessments as well as surveys of the students and their parents, teachers and school administrators.</p>\n\n<p>We used standard statistical methods to explore how a wide range of factors across homes and schools – measured during kindergarten – helped explain whether students later experienced reading difficulties. A key factor, according to our analysis, is the family’s socioeconomic status: a measure including household income and parental education levels and occupations.</p>\n\n<p>Kindergartners who struggled with initial reading, math and science skills, as well as more general learning abilities such as <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43549792\">working memory</a>, were also at higher risk for reading difficulties throughout elementary school.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. elementary students’ reading achievement <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/2025/01/29/naep-reading-scores-decline-and-struggling-students-fall-behind/\">has been declining</a> in recent years. The gap between the highest- and lowest-scoring readers is increasing too.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting these children is important. Students who wrestle with reading are more likely to later experience <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11881-023-00294-4\">anxiety and depression</a>. Adults with reading difficulties are also more likely <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/jchc.21.11.0126\">to be incarcerated</a> <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1177/07319487211012019\">and unemployed</a>. In <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10876375/\">one study</a>, for example, about half of Texas prisoners were poor readers. </p>\n\n<p>Because our findings suggest Black, Hispanic and Native American students are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2025.101504\">at higher risk for reading difficulties</a> by kindergarten, students from these groups may have greater needs for early reading interventions that provide extra help with phonics, vocabulary and reading fluency. Some of these students may also have unrecognized learning disabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Yet students of color are less likely to be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X251347279\">identified with disabilities</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022219420914551\">including dyslexia</a> – even when the students are experiencing early and significant reading difficulties.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>How economic and educational policies and practices can best help lower the risks of reading difficulties is poorly understood. There is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52428-w\">some evidence</a> that cash transfers to financially struggling families may increase children’s later reading achievement. Poverty is also associated with lower exposure to age-appropriate books and other <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cad.20475\">early literacy materials</a> and fewer opportunities to acquire a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12398\">larger vocabulary</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our longitudinal research adds to the very limited understanding of the early economic, environmental, cognitive, academic and behavioral factors that help shape elementary students’ reading abilities.

That year, Texas led the way with 17 executions, while Florida carried out only one.</p>\n\n<p>But this year, the Sunshine State is leading the charge. Florida <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/2025\">has executed 15 prisoners in 2025</a> – the most ever in a single year since 1976, when a brief national moratorium on the death penalty was lifted. Two of the five remaining executions scheduled for 2025 are set to happen in Florida. Texas and Alabama are tied for a distant second, with five executions each. </p>\n\n<p>As someone who <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691102610/when-the-state-kills\">has studied the death penalty for decades</a>, what is happening in Florida right now seems to me to be especially important. While in some ways the state is distinctive, in many others it is a microcosm of America’s death penalty system.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"Q6VHM\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q6VHM/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The history of the death penalty in Florida</h2>\n\n<p>According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Florida <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/florida\">carried out its first execution in 1827</a>, 18 years before it became a state. </p>\n\n<p>Almost 100 years later, in 1923, Florida <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/florida\">replaced hanging with the electric chair</a> as its method of execution. After a brief pause in the use of capital punishment in the 1970s, it was one of the first states to get back in the death penalty business.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, the state <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/law/gruesome-spectacles\">had several gruesome botched electrocutions</a>. In three cases, the condemned man caught on fire before dying in the chair. To this day, the electric chair <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/03/new-florida-law-allows-execution-nitrogen-gas-hanging-firing-squad/84006301007\">remains legal</a> in Florida, though in 2000 the state Legislature enacted a law whereby <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/methods-of-execution/authorized-methods-by-state\">prisoners may choose between the electric chair and lethal injection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken the state to task for various constitutional defects in its death penalty laws and practices. In its 1982 decision in Enmund v. Florida, the court ruled that Florida <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/81-5321\">could not use the death penalty</a> to punish people who were minor participants in a crime that led to a murder. And in 2014, the Supreme Court found that Florida was unconstitutionally <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/701/\">denying the kind of intellectual disability claims</a> by people with low IQ scores that made them ineligible to be given death sentences.</p>\n\n<p>But these rulings have not stopped the state from continuing to go its own way in death penalty cases. In 2020, the Florida Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/death_penalty_representation/project_press/2020/year-end-2020/florida-supreme-court-continues-to-overturn-precedent-throughout-2020/\">ended the practice of having a court review</a> capital sentences. This review was meant to ensure that those sentences met the U.S. Constitution’s requirements that they be meted out only in cases that truly warrant them and that they be proportional. To determine proportionality, the court undertaking such a review would <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/wlr/vol79/iss3/2/\">compare the case in front of them</a> with similar cases in the same jurisdiction in which the death penalty had been imposed.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2023, Florida enacted legislation <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/florida-legislature-rescinds-unanimous-jury-requirement-in-death-sentencing\">ending the requirement of jury unanimity</a> in death cases. Now, it takes only eight out of 12 jurors to send someone to death row. Only three other death penalty states <a href=\"https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2023-04-20/unanimous-juries-are-no-longer-required-for-florida-death-penalty-sentences\">do not require jury unanimity</a>. In Missouri and Indiana, a judge may decide if the jury’s decision isn’t unanimous, and in Alabama, a 10-2 decision is sufficient. </p>\n\n<h2>Racial inequality on death row</h2>\n\n<p>As in the rest of the country, <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/2017-04-21/politifact-florida-on-blacks-grossly-overrepresented-on-states-death-row\">racial discrimination has long been a feature</a> of Florida’s death penalty system. </p>\n\n<p>Thirty-five percent of the 278 people currently on Florida’s death row <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics\">are Black</a>. But Black people make up only about <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/florida.html#race-ethnicity\">17% of Florida’s overall population</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually lower than the <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics\">approximately 40%</a> of inmates on death row who are Black nationwide, despite the fact that Black people make up just <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/\">14% of the U.S. population</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Across the nation, 13 of the 41 inmates executed so far in 2025 have been Black or Latino men.</p>\n\n<p>Florida leads the nation in the number of people – 30 – who have been sentenced to death <a href=\"https://law.vanderbilt.edu/wrongful-convictions-in-a-death-penalty-state/\">only to be exonerated later</a>. Of those, <a href=\"https://www.fadp.org/fl-innocence-list/\">57% were Black</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A record-setting year</h2>\n\n<p>Today, Florida has the <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/death-row-usa\">second-largest death row population</a> in the United States, with 256 inmates awaiting executions. Only California has more, with <a href=\"https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/capital-punishment/condemned-inmate-list-secure-request/\">580 inmates on death row</a>, but it has had a moratorium on executions since 2006.</p>\n\n<p>As Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis is <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/dpi-analysis-death-warrants-under-a-spotlight\">responsible for issuing death warrants</a>. In 2025, he has signed a record-setting 15 so far. That’s the most death warrants in the state in a single year since 2014, when Gov. Rick Scott signed off on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjJNZA0tTrM\">putting eight people to death</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Though he is Catholic, DeSantis does not subscribe to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-the-catholic-church-helped-change-the-conversation-about-capital-punishment-in-the-united-states-260481\">the church’s staunch opposition</a> to the death penalty. The Florida Catholic Conference of Bishops <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/christian-leaders-speak-out-as-desantis-repeatedly-breaks-floridas-execution-record\">has been outspoken</a> in taking him to task for his position on capital punishment and for presiding over an execution spree.

He says that he was <a href=\"https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-11-04/gov-desantis-says-executions-about-justice-amid-modern-era-record\">focused on other priorities</a> early in his term and during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The governor, who is term limited, is <a href=\"https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/05/29/ron-desantis-florida-governor-term-ends/83917362007/\">in his second and last term</a>. DeSantis’ critics allege that the recent uptick in executions is an attempt to garner attention and prove his tough-on-crime bona fides <a href=\"https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-11-04/gov-desantis-says-executions-about-justice-amid-modern-era-record\">to a national audience</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Florida: Setting the trend, or bucking it?</h2>\n\n<p>The total number of executions in the U.S. went from a high of 98 executions in 1999 to a low of 11 in 2021. But that number <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/7397/us-executions-fell-to-a-25-year-low-in-2016/\">has increased every year since</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While only one state, Indiana, has <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/indiana-plans-to-resume-executions-after-15-year-pause-with-a-severely-mentally-ill-volunteer\">resumed executions after a long hiatus</a>, no other state has increased its use of the death penalty as quickly as Florida has. Elsewhere, the common pattern of allowing people <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/death-row-time-on-death-row\">to languish on death row for decades</a>, and in some states seemingly permanently, has held.</p>\n\n<p>And although the problems that have long plagued Florida’s death penalty system remain unaddressed, it now stands alone in dramatically escalating its own pace of executions and is <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-u-s-is-executing-more-people-this-year-and-florida-is-leading-the-way\">leading America</a> to its own 2025 execution revival.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more stories from The Conversation about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/south-florida-miami-news\">Florida</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269125/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Austin Sarat does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Individuals receive three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the typical two copies, resulting in duplicates of the genes encoded on chromosome 21. This trisomy leads to a multitude of changes to heart and immune function as well as neurodevelopmental impairments. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-024-00866-2\">Changes to the structure of neurons</a> in people with Down syndrome alter how they connect with each other. One major type of brain cell <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545142/\">called astrocytes</a> helps form connections between neurons. These star-shaped cells have many thin arms that extend into the spaces between neurons. They also secrete various proteins that are vital to forming the proper neural connections necessary for brain function. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have found that mouse models of several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Down syndrome, have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01150-1\">altered levels of astrocyte proteins</a> during development. <a href=\"https://allen.salk.edu/\">My colleagues</a> <a href=\"https://med.virginia.edu/neuroscience/faculty/primary-faculty/ashley-brandebura-ph-d/\">and I</a> hypothesized that these changes might contribute to the changes in neural connections seen in Down syndrome. Could restoring the proper levels of some of these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116300\">astrocyte proteins “rewire” the brain</a>?</p>\n\n<h2>Identifying an astrocyte protein</h2>\n\n<p>First, we needed to pick a candidate astrocyte protein to test our hypothesis. A previous study had <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01150-1\">identified a list of astrocyte proteins</a> that were altered in a mouse model of Down syndrome. We focused on proteins present in lower levels in Down syndrome astrocytes compared to astrocytes without the condition. We thought there might not be enough of these proteins available to help form neural connections.</p>\n\n<p>Among the top 10 proteins we identified was a molecule <a href=\"https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2N6F\">called pleiotrophin, or Ptn</a>. This protein is known to help guide axons – long extensions that neurons use to send information to each other – to their targets during development. So it made sense that it might also help neurons form the branching arms they use to receive information.</p>\n\n<p>We found that mice unable to produce Ptn had neurons with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116300\">fewer branching arms</a>, similar to what we saw in mice with Down syndrome. This correlation implies that proper Ptn levels are necessary to affect neuron branching during brain development. </p>\n\n<h2>Restoring neurons in Down syndrome</h2>\n\n<p>Next, we wanted to know if delivering Ptn to astrocytes changes neural connections in mice with Down syndrome.</p>\n\n<p>To answer that question, we packaged the gene for Ptn into a small virus with its replication genes removed.

We delivered the Ptn gene into astrocytes throughout the entire brain of adult mice with Down syndrome so we could evaluate its effects.</p>\n\n<p>We focused on the visual cortex and the hippocampus, areas of the brain involved in vision and memory that are both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(81)90314-0\">critically affected</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190645441.013.16\">in Down syndrome</a>. After enhancing the ability of astrocytes to produce Ptn, we found that both regions <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116300\">recovered levels of neural branching density</a> similar to those of mice without Down syndrome. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two children sitting at a table coloring, one holding glasses aloft\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701008/original/file-20251107-56-sry2ow.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Down syndrome can cause visual impairment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/two-sisters-with-genetic-disorder-wearing-royalty-free-image/1071097322\">yacobchuk/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Finally, we wanted to see if we could actually restore electrical activity levels in the hippocampus by increasing astrocyte Ptn levels. Measuring electrical activity can indicate whether neurons are functioning properly.

While our findings are far from ready to be used in the clinic, more research could help us understand whether and how Ptn could help improve the health of human patients.</p>\n\n<h2>Rewiring the brain</h2>\n\n<p>More broadly, our findings suggest that astrocyte proteins have the potential to rewire the brain in other neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886\">adult brains have low plasticity</a>, meaning they have a decreased capacity to form new connections between neurons. This means it can be difficult to change neural circuits in adults. Our hope is that further exploration on how astrocyte proteins can alter the adult brain could lead to new treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.adj1234\">Fragile X syndrome or Rett syndrome</a>, or to neurodegenerative diseases like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-022-00641-1\">Parkinson’s disease</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268739/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ashley Brandebura receives funding from NIH NINDS and NIA. </span></em></p>",

To date, all attempts have failed.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the international body is trying something new. On Sept. 30, 2025, the United Nations Security Council <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-security-council-approves-bigger-force-haiti-tackle-gangs-2025-09-30/\">approved an expanded international military force</a> for Haiti in hopes of turning the tide against organized criminal gangs that have taken hold of swaths of the Caribbean nation.</p>\n\n<p>Resolution 2793 <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2793(2025)\">authorized the doubling</a> of U.N.-backed military and police forces to more than 5,000 and transforming the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support mission in place since 2023 into a new Gang Suppression Force.</p>\n\n<p>Operational command of the mission will now be held by a coalition of nations including Kenya, Canada, Jamaica, the Bahamas, El Salvador, Guatemala and the United States. Meanwhile, the U.N. will provide logistical, administrative and political assistance through the newly established <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2793(2025)\">U.N. Support Office in Haiti</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the true significance of Resolution 2793 lies not in its military content or its specific application in Haiti, but rather in its <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16185.doc.htm\">institutional design</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.bulbul-ahmed.com/\">scholar of international peace operations</a>, I see this as a major shift in how the U.N. exerts authority. The organization’s legitimacy now rests less on commanding troops directly and more on coordinating coalitions. In an era of constrained budgets and fragmented global power, the United Nations increasingly sees its strength in its ability to confer legitimacy and structure collaboration among coalitions of states, regional organizations and international nongovernmental organizations.</p>\n\n<h2>The logic of adaptation</h2>\n\n<p>At one time, U.N. peacekeeping symbolized the collective will of nations deployed across the world under a unified command.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning formally in 1956 with the <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/unef1backgr1.html\">deployment of the first U.N. Emergency Force</a> during the Suez Crisis, peacekeeping operations were conceived as neutral forces positioned between warring parties to monitor ceasefires and buffer zones. </p>\n\n<p>Traditional missions deployed tens of thousands of troops wearing distinctive blue helmets, all under direct U.N. command. Field commanders reported to United Nations headquarters in New York through a clear chain of authority. </p>\n\n<p>At their peak in the 1990s and 2000s, the U.N. ran dozens of these operations simultaneously – from <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/past/untacbackgr1.html\">Cambodia</a> to <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/past/onumozS.htm\">Mozambique</a> and the <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/unprof_b.htm\">Balkans</a> – with mandates to separate combatants, disarm militias and support peace agreements after civil wars. Some succeeded in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/un-peacekeeping-in-africa-is-working-better-than-you-might-think-183748\">ending long-running conflicts</a>, but others became mired in situations where there <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-peacekeeping-75-anniversary-successes-failures-challenges-5a18ab63c9d54104c6863b71aed552cb\">was no peace to keep</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two soldiers stand talking in a dated photo.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701039/original/file-20251107-56-1mg08w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A U.N. peacekeeping soldier, right, shown in 1956 during the first-ever U.N. peacekeeping deployment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/british-general-hugh-stockwell-commander-of-the-anglo-news-photo/1251327570?adppopup=true\">AFP vis Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>U.N. missions such as <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/past/minustah/facts.shtml?utm_source\">those in Haiti</a> from 2004 to 2017 and <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/monusco?utm_source\">in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> from 2010 to the present reflected an era when member states were willing to finance large, multilateral deployments under one flag.</p>\n\n<p>But that model has become harder to sustain.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, U.N. peacekeeping has had to confront not only conventional conflicts but also transnational and urban violence, organized crime and fragile governance –  problems that stretched beyond its original design.</p>\n\n<p>Compounding those challenges in recent years has been deep polarization on the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152166\">U.N. Security Council</a>. Conflicts ranging from Syria to Ukraine have exposed divisions that constrain the authorization of new large-scale missions. Meanwhile, peacekeeping budgets have plateaued as major contributing countries have <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/budget-gaps-threaten-global-peace-efforts\">drawn back funding amid domestic political pressures</a>, and many traditional troop contributors have grown cautious about costly, open-ended deployments. </p>\n\n<p>The United Nations has had to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13533312.2023.2263178\">evolve in a number of ways.</a></p>\n\n<p>Haiti’s most recent multinational security support mission already departed from the classical design. </p>\n\n<p>When the Kenya-led operation was authorized in 2023, it was funded entirely through voluntary contributions from willing countries, not the regular <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-security-council-approves-bigger-force-haiti-tackle-gangs-2025-09-30/\">U.N. budget</a> that all member nations pay into. </p>\n\n<p>It represented a partial departure from traditional peacekeeping by authorizing a non-U.N. coalition under U.N. approval. Resolution 2793 transforms that <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/101/6/2085/8264344\">ad hoc arrangement</a> into a more structured and durable framework. The new Gang Suppression Force features a clearer command architecture, expanded troop strength and a dedicated U.N. support office to coordinate logistics, training and political liaison. </p>\n\n<p>In doing so, it effectively institutionalizes what had been an experimental model, shifting operational control to willing nations while preserving the U.N.’s oversight. Its proponents argue that this approach keeps the organization’s most valuable asset – its legitimacy – at the center of collective security.</p>\n\n<h2>The command clause that changes everything</h2>\n\n<p>Tucked into the new resolution is a paragraph <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2793(2025)\">that entrusts a coalition of participating nations</a> with “strategic direction, oversight and political decision-making,” while day-to-day command remains with the mission’s field commander chosen by that group.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A soldier walks down a street past civilians.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701044/original/file-20251107-56-6gpqpx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A soldier patrols the streets of Port-au-Prince in 2011 during a previous U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/HaitiElections/2e260ff3bf9e482ab73f27ff1329dcca/photo\">AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Under this arrangement, the chain of command flows through a coalition of nations acting with U.N. authorization but not U.N. control. In other words, peacekeeping is being somewhat outsourced – though under the United Nations’ legal and moral umbrella.</p>\n\n<p>The way this new type of model is funded reiterates this logic: All personnel costs will be borne by <a href=\"https://smallstatediplomacy.substack.com/p/un-security-council-approves-new\">voluntary contributions</a>, not the U.N.’s assessed peacekeeping budget. This approach gives donor countries flexibility while keeping the United Nations’ human rights and reporting obligations intact.</p>\n\n<p>This is not mere bureaucratic tinkering. It represents the U.N.’s redefinition of how it sees its comparative advantage – from direct command to <a href=\"https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/09/haiti-vote-on-a-draft-resolution-authorising-a-gang-suppression-force-and-a-un-support-office.php?utm_source\">networked coordination</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Risks and promise of the Haiti model</h2>\n\n<p>The new Gang Suppression Force in Haiti offers both opportunities and challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Its coalition structure could enhance responsiveness and regional ownership of the problem. Indeed, countries neighboring Haiti or with historical ties have strong incentives to stabilize the situation. The mission could deploy more quickly than traditional U.N. operations, which often take months to organize. </p>\n\n<p>For everyday Haitians, this could mean faster relief from gang violence that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, shut down schools and hospitals, and made basic activities like going to the market dangerous. If successful, the force could help the Haitian government to gradually restore its authority over neighborhoods currently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/02/haiti-un-security-council-gang-suppression-force/\">controlled by armed groups</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Four soldiers stand together.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C46%2C1024%2C576&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=391&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701045/original/file-20251107-74-xl9orv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=492&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The latest U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti signals a shift in focus.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/HaitiUN/bd5309d687a24f14ac67dd82af157f3b/photo\">AP Photo/Dieu Nalio Chery</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But coordination challenges could emerge when multiple countries share control, and disagreements over strategy or rules of engagement could slow decision-making. There are also questions about how this model ensures consistent oversight – different countries may have varying standards for human rights monitoring or different interpretations of the mission’s scope.</p>\n\n<p>Resolution 2793 tries to address these concerns by mandating robust human rights safeguards, child-protection advisers and clear <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2793(2025)\">rules of engagement</a>. If these mechanisms work effectively, they could set a new standard for hybrid peace operations.</p>\n\n<p>For Haiti, the stakes are existential. Success will depend on seamless coordination between the Gang Suppression Force, the Haitian National Police and civil authorities, and on ensuring that stabilization builds up Haiti’s own capacity to maintain security rather than creating long-term reliance on foreign forces.</p>\n\n<h2>A template for the future?</h2>\n\n<p>The Gang Suppression Force embodies both the risks and the promise of the United Nations’ reinvention. If coordination succeeds, it could provide a practical blueprint for missions in settings where large, centrally managed U.N. deployments are politically or financially difficult to sustain.

In an electric field, anything with an electrical charge – from an individual atom to a large particle – experiences a force that can be used to push it in a desired direction. </p>\n\n<p>When an electric field pushes charged particles in a fluid, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis\">process is called electrophoresis</a>. Our research team is investigating how to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/electrophoresis\">harness electrophoresis</a> to move tiny particles – called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/nanoparticle\">nanoparticles</a> – in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porous_medium\">porous, spongy materials</a>. Many emerging technologies, including those used in DNA analysis and medical diagnostics, use these porous materials. </p>\n\n<p>Figuring out how to control the tiny charged particles as they travel through these environments can make them faster and more efficient in existing technologies. It can also enable entirely new <a href=\"https://www.roboticstomorrow.com/news/2025/03/12/nanorobots-the-tiny-machines-revolutionizing-medicine-and-industry/24416e\">smart functions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, scientists are aiming to make particles like these serve as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c03911\">tiny nanorobots</a>. These could perform complex tasks in our bodies or our surroundings. They could search for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adh3073\">tumors and deliver treatments</a> or seek out sources of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.155135\">toxic chemicals in the soil</a> and convert them to benign compounds.</p>\n\n<p>To make these advances, we need to understand how charged nanoparticles travel through porous, spongy materials under the influence of an electric field. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2514874122\">In a new study</a>, published Nov. 10, 2025, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=njpX--gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">our team</a> of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oiMqxxoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">engineering researchers</a> led by Anni Shi and Siamak Mirfendereski sought to do just that.</p>\n\n<h2>Weak and strong electric fields</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine a nanoparticle as a tiny submarine navigating a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/nanofluidics\">complex, interconnected, liquid-filled maze</a> while simultaneously experiencing random jiggling motion. While watching nanoparticles move through a porous material, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2514874122\">observed a surprising behavior</a> related to the strength of the applied electric field. </p>\n\n<p>A weak electric field acts only as an accelerator, boosting the particle’s speed and dramatically improving its chance of finding any exit from a cavity, but offering no directional guidance – it’s fast, but random. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, a strong electric field provides the necessary “GPS coordinates,” forcing the particle to move rapidly in a specific, predictable direction across the network. </p>\n\n<p>This discovery was puzzling but exciting, because it suggested that we could control the nanoparticles’ motion. We could choose to have them move fast and randomly with a weak field or directionally with a strong field. </p>\n\n<p>The former allows them to search the environment efficiently while the latter is ideal for delivering cargo. This puzzling behavior prompted us to look more closely at what the weak field was doing to the surrounding fluid.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700920/original/file-20251106-56-otxsp7.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A diagram showing tiny particles in a porous material.

A weak field causes the stagnant liquid to flow in random swirling motions within the material’s tiny cavities. This random flow enhances a particle’s natural jiggling and pushes it toward the cavity walls. By moving along walls, the particle drastically increases its probability of finding a random escape route, compared to searching throughout the entire cavity space. </p>\n\n<p>A strong field, however, provides a powerful directional push to the particle. That push overcomes the natural jiggling of the particle as well as the random flow of the surrounding liquid. It ensures that the particle migrates predictably along <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/line-of-force\">the direction of the electric field</a>. This insight opens the door for new, efficient strategies to move, sort and separate particles. </p>\n\n<h2>Tracking nanoparticles</h2>\n\n<p>To conduct this research, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2514874122\">we integrated</a> laboratory observation with computational modeling.

In these, the goal is fast, accurate and differential particle movement. Examples include drug delivery, which requires guiding “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201706100\">nanocargo” to specific tissue targets</a>, or industrial separation, which entails <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.10.022\">purifying chemicals</a> and filtering contaminants. </p>\n\n<p>Our discovery – the ability to separately control a particle’s speed using weak fields and its direction using strong fields – acts as a two-lever control tool. </p>\n\n<p>This control may allow engineers to design devices that apply weak or strong fields to move different particle types in tailored ways. Ultimately, this tool could improve faster and more efficient diagnostic tools and purification systems.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve established independent control over the particles’ searching using speed and their migration using direction. But we still don’t know the phenomenon’s full limits.</p>\n\n<p>Key questions remain: What are the upper and lower sizes of particles that can be controlled in this way? Can this method be reliably applied in complex, dynamic biological environments? </p>\n\n<p>Most fundamentally, we’ll need to investigate the exact mechanism behind the dramatic speedup of these particles under a weak electric field. Answering these questions is essential to unlocking the full precision of this particle control method.</p>\n\n<p>Our work is part of a larger scientific push to understand how confinement and boundaries influence the motion of nanoscale objects. As technology shrinks, understanding how these particles interact with nearby surfaces will help design efficient, tiny devices. And when moving through spongy, porous materials, nanoparticles are constantly encountering surfaces and boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>The collective goal of our and others’ <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.160604\">related research</a> is to transform the control of tiny particles from a process of trial and error into a reliable, predictable science.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268553/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Daniel K.

Let’s start by distinguishing <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/not-all-polarization-is-bad-but-the-us-could-be-in-trouble-173833\">two kinds of polarization</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>First is political polarization. It measures the divide between the U.S.’s two major parties. When political polarization is severe, the common ground among the parties falls away. This naturally undermines cooperation. That <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/\">Republicans and Democrats are politically polarized</a> is certainly part of the explanation for the shutdown. </p>\n\n<p>But that’s not the entire story. As I argue in my book “<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/civic-solitude-9780197752166\">Civic Solitude</a>,” the deeper trouble has to do with <a href=\"https://www.discoursemagazine.com/p/the-polarization-dynamic\">belief polarization</a>.  </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Unlike political polarization, which measures the distance between opposing groups, belief polarization occurs within a single group. In belief polarization, like-minded people transform into more extreme version of themselves: Liberals become more liberal, conservatives become more conservative, Second Amendment advocates become more pro-gun, environmentalists become more green, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, this shift is driven by the desire to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/political-polarization-is-about-feelings-not-facts-120397\">fit in with one’s peers</a>, not by evidence or reason. Hence, we become more fervent but no better informed.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, our more extreme selves are also more tribal and conformist.  As we shift, we become more antagonistic toward outsiders. We also become more insistent on uniformity within our group, less tolerant of differences. </p>\n\n<h2>Animosity and obstruction</h2>\n\n<p>The combination of intensifying antagonism toward those on the “other side” and escalating cohesion among those on “your side” turns all aspects of life into politics.  </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S. today, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/partisan-divide-creates-different-americas-separate-lives-122925\">liberals and conservatives are heavily socially segregated</a>. They live in different neighborhoods, work in different professions, vacation in different locations, drive different vehicles and shop in different stores. Everyday behavior has become an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12152\">extension of partisan affiliation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, as everyday life becomes politically saturated, politics itself becomes <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/\">more about lifestyle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-identity-not-issues-explains-the-partisan-divide/\">less about policy</a>.  <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfy005\">Research</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12485\">suggests</a> that while <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/\">animosity across the parties</a> has intensified significantly, citizens’ disagreements over policy have either <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12628\">remained stable or eased</a>. We dislike one another more intensely yet are not more divided.</p>\n\n<p>This paints a grim portrait of U.S. democracy. Note that this condition incentivizes politicians to <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2840225\">amplify their contempt</a> for political rivals. Politicians seek to win elections, and stoking negative feelings such as fear and indignation are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/14789299211000187\">potent triggers of political behavior</a>, including voting. </p>\n\n<p>Consequently, when citizens are belief-polarized, animosity and obstruction become winning electoral strategies. Meanwhile, politicians are released from the task of serving the common good.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of people standing behind a man who's standing at a lectern, behind a sign that says 'The DEMOCRAT SHUTDOWN.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/701503/original/file-20251110-56-tcdomu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a news conference with House Republican leadership at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 6, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/speaker-of-the-house-mike-johnson-speaks-during-a-news-news-photo/2244824511?adppopup=true\">Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Channeling contempt</h2>\n\n<p>It is no surprise that discussions of the shutdown have consistently focused on blame. </p>\n\n<p>The Republicans, who hold the congressional majority, have sought to score points by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-government-websites-become-campaign-tools-blaming-the-shutdown-on-democrats-has-legal-and-political-risks-267086\">depicting the shutdown as the Democrats’ fault</a>.

Their aim has been to channel citizens’ frustration into contempt for the Democratic Party.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed that there was “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/02/congress/mike-johnson-shutdown-senate-negotiations-00591695\">literally nothing to negotiate</a>” with congressional Democrats. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s the rub. Democratic government is fundamentally a matter of negotiation. Neither winning an election nor being a member of the majority party means that you can simply call the shots. The constitutional procedures by which our representatives govern are designed to force cooperation, collaboration and compromise.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to polarization, however, these noble ideals of political give-and-take have dissolved. Cooperation is now seen as <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/06/19/partisans-say-respect-and-compromise-are-important-in-politics-particularly-from-their-opponents/\">surrender to political enemies</a>. That’s very clear in many <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/democratic-unity-fractures-government-reopen\">Democrats’ outraged reactions</a> to the eight senators from their caucus who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/09/senate-democrats-shutdown-vote-00644146\">have now voted with Republicans to end the shutdown</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, more than 1 million <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/who-is-missing-paychecks-in-the-2025-shutdown-when-and-where/\">government employees haven’t been paid</a>, many <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/federal-government-shutdown-what-it-means-for-states-and-programs\">crucial government services</a> have been interrupted, diminished or suspended, and, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, travelers are experiencing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/weekend-travel-flight-cuts-government-shutdown-hnk\">flight disruptions</a>. While there may be <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/handful-of-senate-democrats-join-gop-to-break-funding-stalemate-first-step-toward-ending-shutdown\">an end to the shutdown</a> on the near horizon, any deal could simply postpone crucial policy debates and could well end in another shutdown in the new year.</p>\n\n<p>The key to avoiding this kind of failure is to become a citizenry that demands competent government over partisan domination.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269041/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert B.

Other programs protect forests through payments for ecosystem services, such as paying landowners to maintain existing forests and the benefits those forests provide. These programs provide money to a government, community or landowner based on verified results that the forest is being protected over time.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, despite these and many other efforts, the world is <a href=\"https://forestdeclaration.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Assessment2025.pdf\">falling short</a> on its commitments to protect tropical forests.

When <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/09/the-formula-that-reduced-deforestation-in-brazil-in-the-21st-century/\">enforcement is weakened</a>, as happened in Brazil from 2019 to 2023, illegal land clearing and forest loss ramp back up. Programs that pay landowners to keep forests standing also have drawbacks. Research has shown they might only <a href=\"https://www.forestsnews.org/84706/what-happens-after-conservation-payments-stop?fnl=en\">temporarily reduce deforestation</a> if they don’t continue payments long term.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that deforestation is often driven by economic factors such as <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/forest-extent-indicators/deforestation-agriculture\">global demand for crops, cattle</a> and <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?8455466/Mining-impacts-affect-up-to-13-of-global-forest-ecosystems-and-tipped-to-rise-with-increased-demand-for-metals\">minerals</a> such as gold and copper. This demand provides significant incentives to farmers, companies and governments to continue clearing forests.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of money committed to protecting forests globally is about US$5.7 billion per year – <a href=\"https://forestsandfinance.org/\">a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars banks and investors</a> put into the companies that drive deforestation.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"dTG3C\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dTG3C/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Simply put, the scale of the deforestation problem is massive, and new efforts are needed to truly reverse the economic <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/new-drivers-data-forest-loss/\">drivers or causes</a> of deforestation.</p>\n\n<p>In order to increase the amount of funding to protect tropical forests, Brazil launched a global program on Nov. 6, 2025, ahead of the annual U.N. climate conference, called the <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a>, or TFFF. It is an innovative approach that combines money from countries and private investors to compensate countries for preserving tropical forests.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/academics/centers/emmett-institute-climate-change-environment\">environmental law scholar</a> who works in climate policy development, including to protect tropical forests, I believe the design of the program has real promise. But I also see room to improve it by bringing in states and provinces to ensure money reaches programs closer to the ground that will pay off for the environment.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>What makes the Tropical Forest Forever Facility different?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> seeks to tackle the deforestation problem by focusing on the issue of scale – both geographic and economic.</p>\n\n<p>First, it will measure results across entire countries rather than at the smaller landowner level. That can help reduce deforestation more broadly within countries and influence national policies that currently contribute to deforestation.

While the fund’s design could draw more investors, if its investments don’t have strong returns in a given year, the fund might not receive any money, likely leaving a gap in expected payments for the programs and communities protecting forests.</p>\n\n<p>Many existing international funding programs also provide money solely to national governments, as the <a href=\"https://www.amazonfund.gov.br/en/home/\">Amazon Fund</a> and the U.N.’s <a href=\"https://www.thegef.org/who-we-are\">Global Environment Facility</a> do. However, a lot of the actual work to reduce deforestation, from policy innovation to implementation and enforcement, takes place at the state and provincial levels.</p>\n\n<p>One way to improve the Tropical Forest Forever Facility’s implementation would be to include state- and provincial-level governments in decisions about how payments will be used and ensure those funds make it to the people taking action in their territories.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gcftf.org/\">Governors’ Climate and Forests Task Force</a>, a group of 45 states and provinces from 11 countries, <a href=\"https://www.gcftf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Carta_de_Acre_May_en_vf.pdf\">has been giving feedback</a> on how to incorporate that recommendation. </p>\n\n<p>The task force developed a <a href=\"https://www.gcftf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blueprint-Oct-10-2024-ENGLISH.pdf\">Blueprint for a New Forest Economy</a>, which can help connect efforts such as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility to state- and community-level forest protection initiatives so funding reaches projects that can pay off for forest protection. </p>\n\n<p>The Tropical Forest Forever Facility is an example of the type of innovative mechanism that could accelerate action globally. But to truly succeed, it will need to be coordinated with state and provincial governments, communities and others doing the work on the ground.

Measles is highly contagious, and a drop in childhood vaccination rates <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html\">in Canada</a> and in other countries has left many children unprotected from the disease.</p>\n\n<p>The resurgence of measles in Canada after decades with very low numbers of cases <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/measles-could-again-become-widespread-as-cases-surge-worldwide-255501\">is not an isolated problem</a>. The U.S. has also had <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/measles-cases-are-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-make-sure-youre-protected-252277\">large outbreaks of measles this year</a>, and it will likely soon lose its measles-free designation as well.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of measles elimination status is a symptom of a deeper issue: <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/from-drew-altman/the-problem-isnt-trust-in-vaccines-its-that-people-dont-know-who-to-trust/\">declining trust</a> in public messaging about science and health, which has led to decreased vaccination rates and growing vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>\n\n<h2>What does it mean for a country to be measles-free?</h2>\n\n<p>Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet. Before the measles vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination\">licensed for use in 1963</a>, nearly every child got measles infection and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles\">more than 2 million children died</a> from measles each year. </p>\n\n<p>The vaccine decreased that risk dramatically. By 1968, five years after the vaccine became available, case counts in the U.S. had <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death\">dropped by more than 95%</a>. Cases in Canada also <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles/health-professionals-measles.html\">decreased substantially</a> after the vaccine was introduced.</p>\n\n<p>Tragically, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles\">about 100,000 children still die from measles</a> each year even though a safe, effective and low-cost vaccine is available. Almost all of those deaths occur in low-income countries where many children do not have access to recommended vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>The World Health Organization uses <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2622975/\">three labels to describe</a> how well a country is preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as measles. A disease is said to be controlled when public health interventions such as routine childhood vaccinations significantly lower the rate of new infections. A disease is considered to be eliminated from a country when the only cases that happen are small outbreaks linked to international travel. And finally, a disease is deemed eradicated only after several years of no cases occurring anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve the status of measles elimination, a country must have no ongoing local transmission of the disease <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/\">for at least one year</a>. It will lose that status if it has a chain of cases that spread from person to person for more than one year.  </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvjAeItSMhA?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Measles cases have occurred in every province in Canada in 2025.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Once a country has eliminated measles, there is almost no risk from the disease as long as vaccination rates stay high. But when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks will soon start happening.</p>\n\n<h2>What happened in Canada?</h2>\n\n<p>In 1998, the Pan American Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/these-doctors-helped-eliminate-measles-in-98-heres-how-they-did-it/\">confirmed that Canada had eliminated measles transmission</a>. Two years later, the U.S. also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html\">gained the measles-free designation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By 2016, every country in the Americas had achieved measles elimination status. The region <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2024.93\">lost that status in 2018</a> after outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela, and then <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles\">regained it in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But childhood vaccination rates <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01037-2\">have been falling worldwide</a>, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect communities from measles outbreaks, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/\">about 95% of the population</a> must be vaccinated against the disease.  </p>\n\n<p>In Canada, the percentage of 2-year-olds who have received at least one dose of measles vaccine dropped from about 90% in 2019 to <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html\">about 82% in 2022 and 2023</a>. As the number of unvaccinated people in the population increased, the risk of measles outbreaks grew.  </p>\n\n<p>After having only 16 total cases of measles nationwide between 2020 and 2023, the number of measles cases in Canada jumped to more than 100 in 2024 and <a href=\"https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/\">more than 5,000 cases in 2025</a>. Cases have occurred among infants, children and adults in every Canadian province in 2025, and two infants have died. </p>\n\n<p>Fewer than 10% of the people who have gotten sick had been vaccinated against the disease.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n\n<p>It is likely that both the U.S. and Mexico will lose their measles-free designation in 2026, because both countries have had <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-31-fold-americas-region-year\">sustained outbreaks of measles</a> since early 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html\">more than 90% of kindergartners in the U.S.</a> are vaccinated against measles, that rate is too low to protect communities from outbreaks. An <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/texas-records-first-us-measles-death-in-10-years-a-medical-epidemiologist-explains-how-to-protect-yourself-and-your-community-from-this-deadly-preventable-disease-251004\">outbreak that started in Texas</a> in January 2025 <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025\">infected more than 760 people</a> and caused the deaths of two children. </p>\n\n<p>In total, more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">1,600 Americans</a> in more than 40 states have gotten sick from measles in 2025. That is more cases than any year since 1992. More than 90% of the people who got sick were unvaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>Mexico has also had <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/informe-diario-del-brote-de-sarampion-en-mexico-2025\">thousands of measles cases this year</a>, mostly among unvaccinated people.</p>\n\n<p>Central America, South America and the Caribbean will retain their measles-free status for now. But the outbreaks in North America increase the risk of measles spreading to other countries.</p>\n\n<p>Without a significant improvement in vaccination coverage and public trust in community health measures, many countries are likely to face more, and bigger, outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the coming years.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269090/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Kathryn H.

Are our <a href=\"https://news.syr.edu/2025/10/23/the-great-divide-understanding-us-political-polarization/\">current divisions</a> like the ones that preceded the American Revolution or the Civil War? Did the dramatic events of the 1960s generate the same kind of social and political forces seen today? Are there lessons from the past that show us how eras of intense political turmoil eventually subside?    </p>\n\n<p>As a scholar of <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/experts/robert-strong\">American politics and the presidency</a>, I believe one American historical period is especially worth revisiting in this turbulent moment in the U.S.: the 20 tumultuous years between the presidencies of Ulysses S. Grant and William McKinley in the second half of the 19th century. </p>\n\n<p>The two decades between 1876 and 1896 are usually remembered as a time when the cities in the East grew rich and the West was wild – <a href=\"https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/beneath-the-gold-exploring-gilded-age-extremes\">a “Gilded Age” in New York City</a> and gunslingers on the frontier.   </p>\n\n<p>It was also a time when Americans struggled with immigration issues, racial injustice, tariff levels, technological change, economic volatility and political violence.    </p>\n\n<p>There was even a president, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/grover-cleveland\">Grover Cleveland, who served two nonconsecutive terms in the White House</a> – the only time that happened before Donald Trump.    </p>\n\n<p>In the elections between Grant and McKinley, <a href=\"https://news.virginia.edu/content/back-future-2024-election-lot-19th-century-contests\">the nation was closely divided</a>. No president in those years – <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-presidents-timeline\">not Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester Arthur, Cleveland or Benjamin Harrison</a> – served for two consecutive terms. No presidential candidate won more than 50% of the popular vote, <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/disputed-election-1876\">except the Democrat Samuel Tilden</a>. And Tilden, after winning 50.1% of the ballots cast in 1876, lost in the Electoral College. That happened again in 1888 when Cleveland, the first time he was seeking a second term, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1888\">won the popular vote but failed in the Electoral College</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The narrow victories that characterized presidential politics in the 1870s and 1880s were matched by constant shifts on Capitol Hill. In the 20 years between Grant and McKinley, there were <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/\">only six years of unified government</a>, when one political party controlled the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the remaining 14 years, presidents encountered opposition in Congress.   </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has the same kind of divided politics today.  </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"2K25t\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2K25t/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Heating up partisanship and raising stakes</h2>\n\n<p>President Bill Clinton had <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/\">two years of unified government; President George W. Bush had less than that</a>. Barack Obama, Donald Trump in his first term and Joe Biden all came into office with party majorities in the House and Senate, and then, like Clinton, their parties <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/\">lost the House two years later</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Divided politics, with close elections and neither party in power for very long, <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/what-19th-century-politics-can-teach-us-about-today\">make partisanship more intense</a>, campaigns harder fought and the stakes sky high whenever voters go to the polls. That’s part of what produced instability in the second half of the 19th century and part of what produces it today. </p>\n\n<p>Divided government is, of course, <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S1-3-1/ALDE_00013290/\">one of the most powerful “checks</a>” in the constitutional system of checks and balances. Intense competition between political parties can prevent the national government from making rash decisions and serious mistakes. It can sometimes generate compromise. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Protesters in a cloud of tear gas face off against a federal agent with a gun.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700131/original/file-20251103-56-8gaqrf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Residents and protesters clash with federal agents on Chicago’s East Side on Oct. 14, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/residents-and-protesters-clash-with-federal-agents-in-the-news-photo/2240700506?adppopup=true\">Joshua Lott/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But there’s a cost. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/not-all-polarization-is-bad-but-the-us-could-be-in-trouble-173833\">Political division can also allow critical problems</a> to fester for far too long. The dramatic changes brought on by the Industrial Revolution after the Civil War were not seriously addressed in federal legislation until the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/\">Progressive Era</a> early in the 20th century. </p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/history-of-u-s-tariffs-and-why-it-matters-today/\">second half of the 19th century, Congress raised or lowered tariffs</a> – depending on which party controlled the White House and Capitol Hill. The nation debated immigration <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/09/30/how-u-s-immigration-laws-and-rules-have-changed-through-history/\">but only once passed meaningful legislation</a>, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. A long list of issues connected to railroads, banks, currency, civil service, corruption and the implementation of the post-Civil War constitutional amendments <a href=\"https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/modernushistory/chapter/politics-in-the-gilded-age-1870-1900/\">were ignored or only partially addressed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When major legislation was passed <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/pendleton-act\">in 1883 to create a merit-based civil service</a> – reforming the spoils system of political appointments – it passed because <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-federal-civil-service-and-the-death-of-president-james-a-garfield.htm\">Garfield’s 1881 assassination by a disgruntled federal job seeker</a> temporarily pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda. </p>\n\n<h2>Immigration, fake news and riots</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/violence-has-long-been-a-feature-of-american-elections-67688\">Political violence accompanied the period of closely divided national elections</a> in the 1870s and 1880s.    </p>\n\n<p>In the 1880 presidential campaign, both candidates – the Republican, Garfield, and the Democrat, Winfield Hancock – <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1880\">called for restrictions on Chinese immigration to the United States</a>. Neither supported the complete ban that many Westerners wanted. </p>\n\n<p>But just before Americans went to the polls, newspapers across the country printed a letter, <a href=\"https://www.hnn.us/article/the-phony-document-that-almost-cost-a-president-hi\">allegedly written and signed by Garfield, that endorsed an open border</a> to Chinese immigrants. Before anyone could learn that the letter was a fake, there was public uproar. In Denver, an angry mob <a href=\"https://www.historycolorado.org/sites/default/files/media/document/2018/ColoradoMagazine_v42n4_Fall1965.pdf\">burned down all the homes in Chinese neighborhoods</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>There were more incidents of political violence: <a href=\"https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/lapl/chinese-massacre-1871\">anti-Chinese riots in Los Angeles in 1871</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/1877-san-francisco-anti-chinese-race-riots-11302710.php\">in San Francisco in 1877</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WAExclusion.pdf\">Seattle in 1886</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Throughout the 1880s, anti-immigrant <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/italian/under-attack/\">nativists targeted immigrants from Italy</a> and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/when-america-hated-catholics-213177\">vandalized Catholic churches</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Political violence in the South successfully <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/reconstruction-southern-violence-during-reconstruction/\">suppressed Black voting rights and reestablished white control</a> of state and local politics.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A scene of mourners at the deathbed of President James Garfield.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=444&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=558&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=558&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700139/original/file-20251103-69-wcbgdd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=558&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Political violence accompanied the period of closely divided national elections in the 1870s and 1880s, including the assassination of President James Garfield in 1881.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/death-of-general-james-a-garfield-twentieth-president-of-news-photo/1177463872?adppopup=true\">Glasshouse Vintage/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Realignment</h2>\n\n<p>Political division in the second half of the 19th century produced more problems than solutions. How and when did it end, or become less intense? </p>\n\n<p>The simple answer is what political scientists call a “realignment,” a major shift in national electoral patterns.  </p>\n\n<p>In 1893, the first year of Cleveland’s second term, the nation <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/51665/chapter/419689328\">suffered a financial crisis followed by a severe economic depression</a>. As a result, McKinley was able to win <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/president/mckinley/campaigns-and-elections\">solid victories in 1896 and 1900</a> and build a Republican coalition that dominated presidential politics until the election <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1932\">in 1932 of Democrat Franklin Roosevelt</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not hard to imagine how an economic disaster, or a crisis of some kind, could shake the country out of a period of closely divided politics. But that’s a painful way of building a higher level of national unity.</p>\n\n<p>Can it happen when large numbers of voters get thoroughly frustrated by languishing issues, swings back and forth in Washington, nasty elections and rising political violence?  </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps. </p>\n\n<p>But either way – responding to crisis or finding a public change of heart – is a reminder that voters are the ultimate arbiters in a functioning democracy. Today, as in late-19th-century America, elections make a difference. They can mark continued division or they can take the nation in a new, and perhaps more unified, direction.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267292/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert A.

The survey was conducted online in August and September.</p>\n\n<p>Among all respondents, 61% say that immigrants, regardless of legal status, should have basic rights and protections, including the ability to challenge deportation in court. Sixty-five percent oppose deporting undocumented immigrants without due process to prisons in other countries.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A few priests in white robes stand behind a table in an outdoor tent full of seated people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700605/original/file-20251105-56-8teali.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Rev.

One advocate I interviewed said, “We want to be single-issue. … We want to have a large coalition, and being single-issue is how we do that.” </p>\n\n<p>This advocate works for a secular, national organization that opposes abortion because it ends the life of a human organism. She acknowledged that it can be difficult to decide where to draw the line: “How connected does something have to be to abortion for it to count?” This question arises when the group chooses whether to take a position on policies such as expanding funding for adoption services.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman holds a sign that says, 'Science says...abortion kills a human being.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700821/original/file-20251106-66-x3ohk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A protester demonstrates in front of a Planned Parenthood clinic on July 12, 2022, in Saint Paul, Minn.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=abortion%20protest&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Abbie Parr</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Other groups that identify as pro-life are ideologically conservative and often take on other culture war issues. The <a href=\"https://www.ccv.org/about\">Center for Christian Virtue</a>, for example, advocates against abortion but also is in favor of school choice and increased funding for “responsible fatherhood initiatives,” such as parenting classes and mentorship programs.</p>\n\n<p>Still other groups focus on both beginning-of-life and end-of-life issues. These organizations are inspired by religious beliefs that life is a gift from God and should be protected from conception until <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cb/cbx021\">natural death</a>. In addition to abortion, these organizations oppose the use of embryos and fetal stem cells in scientific research and often oppose in vitro fertilization. They also advocate against legalizing euthanasia and <a href=\"https://code-medical-ethics.ama-assn.org/ethics-opinions/physician-assisted-suicide\">physician-assisted suicide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A fourth type of group has a more expansive definition of pro-life, closely aligned with Leo’s comments. These groups, whose mission statements are often secular, sometimes refer to themselves as protecting life “womb to tomb,” or “pro-life for the whole life.” Groups such as <a href=\"https://www.democratsforlife.org/index.php\">Democrats for Life of America</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newwavefeminists.com/\">New Wave Feminists</a> incorporate issues such as economic inequality, systemic discrimination and support for migrants into their advocacy. </p>\n\n<p>Organizations with this type of holistic approach may also describe themselves as following a “consistent life ethic.” Popularized by <a href=\"https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2023/12/06/bernardin-anniversary-consistent-ethic-246654/\">Cardinal Joseph Bernardin</a> in the 1980s, the term stems from Catholic social teaching but is also used by secular groups. This approach emphasizes human dignity and supporting <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/3712351\">policies that affirm life at all stages</a>. That may include opposition to the death penalty and support for social programs, such as food and housing assistance. </p>\n\n<h2>Role of religion</h2>\n\n<p>From my research, I have not found a clear relationship between the policies a group advocates on behalf of and its religious affiliation.</p>\n\n<p>Many explicitly call themselves Catholic or Christian. Their mission statements may mention religion. Their publications may include Bible quotes or prayers. They sponsor events in collaboration with churches.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://all.org/about\">American Life League</a> identifies itself as “the oldest grassroots Catholic pro-life education organization in the United States.” <a href=\"https://studentsforlife.org/about/who-we-are/\">Students for Life of America</a> calls its statement of faith “Judeo-Christian,” even though roughly 8 in 10 <a href=\"https://prri.org/research/abortion-attitudes-in-a-post-roe-world-findings-from-the-50-state-2022-american-values-atlas/\">American Jews support legal abortion</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A line of protesters pose at the bottom of a long flight of steps, holding a sign that says 'Pro-life, pro-woman.'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700602/original/file-20251105-64-gj42jp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Anti-abortion protesters wait outside the Supreme Court for a decision on the Russo v.

An advocate from one such group described many of the members as “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-pope-francis-changed-the-catholic-church\">Pope Francis Catholics</a>,” indicating a more progressive view on many social issues.</p>\n\n<p>Another advocate I spoke with described herself as a devout Catholic but recognized that the anti-abortion movement is often “bashed for being religious.” To <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-ohio-and-other-states-decide-on-abortion-anti-abortion-activists-look-to-rebrand-themselves-as-not-religious-215408\">break away from that stereotype</a>, she said, “That’s why we’re kind of relying on the science. And when I send emails, I never bring in Scripture, and I think people think I might be just agnostic or whatever.”</p>\n\n<p>Other secular groups tie their pro-life advocacy to a broader fight for human rights. <a href=\"https://www.rehumanizeintl.org/\">Rehumanize International</a>, to name one, says its mission is to “ensure that each and every human being’s life is respected, valued, and protected.” Such groups may hold progressive views such as opposing war and the death penalty, as well as concern about climate change. Political science research indicates that positioning opposition to abortion as a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12083\">human rights issue</a>, rather than a religious one, may attract more younger Americans.</p>\n\n<p>It would be a mistake to assume that everyone in these movements adheres to one viewpoint, or is interested only in stopping abortion. In reality, there are many motivations that lead to people using the phrase “pro-life.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268066/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Anne Whitesell is a 2025-2026 PRRI Public Fellow. </span></em></p>",

Brown/AFP via Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine walking out of a Walmart, Target or Costco. As you push your large shopping cart to your car, you ask yourself: Did I really need all that stuff? </p>\n\n<p>The answer is you probably didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/inm/ormsom/v27y2025i5p1604-1624.html\">recent study</a>, my co-authors <a href=\"https://directory.smeal.psu.edu/lkw5428\">Lina Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://gsb.snu.ac.kr/en/faculty?major=3&amp;idx=2903\">Sungho Park</a> and I found that the presence of supercenters – large retailers that sell groceries alongside general merchandise – results in a significant uptick in consumer waste due to overpurchasing.</p>\n\n<p>These supercenters often sit on lots in excess of 150,000 square feet. But figuring out how all that real estate affects people’s shopping habits – if it does at all – is tricky. That’s because a lot of factors influence how much people buy on a single shopping trip.</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question, we looked at the impact of the spread of Walmart supercenters across the U.S. over a decade, using a technique called <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/difference-difference-estimation\">difference-in-differences</a> – an analytical method in which we compared consumer waste trends in counties that saw supercenter launches with “matched” counties that did not. This matching ensured that counties were otherwise closely comparable on socioeconomic factors such as housing, income and education.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis showed that the launch of a supercenter results in an increase in consumer waste of up to 7%. Furthermore, this increase in consumer waste is larger for new supercenter openings compared with conversions, when existing regular stores are expanded into large-format ones. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, neighborhood stores across the U.S. were edged out by large-format retailers: department stores, supercenters and shopping malls. Although there is evidence that many of these big-name retailers are <a href=\"https://www.modernretail.co/operations/retailers-like-target-and-nordstrom-are-rethinking-their-approach-to-small-format-stores/\">beginning to look toward smaller stores</a>, the shopping landscape remains dotted by supercenters.</p>\n\n<p>And these large stores stimulate mass consumption through gradual shifts in <a href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2143\">consumer behaviors</a>. For example, in their attempt to generate more sales, large-format retailers often underprice smaller neighborhood stores.</p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, Walmart’s “<a href=\"https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/walmart-edlp-everyday-low-pricing-strategy/\">everyday low price” strategy</a>, which is key to its business model. This pricing strategy offers shoppers a largely consistent year-round low price rather than relying on occasional sales and discounts.</p>\n\n<p>Further contributing to overpurchasing is the supercenters’ typical location, which tends to be away from residential areas. Naturally, in their effort to avoid multiple trips, consumers tend to maximize the utility of each visit by making their basket sizes larger.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this overpurchasing often leads to waste as more goods reach expiration date or sit unused in people’s homes. </p>\n\n<p>While this may be a profitable strategy for retailers, it’s bad for society and the environment and creates billions of dollars in waste. To put this into context, the United States generates close to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/guide-facts-and-figures-report-about\">300 million tons of consumer waste every year</a>, and then spends <a href=\"https://cbcny.org/research/12-things-new-yorkers-should-know-about-their-garbage\">billions of dollars</a> managing this waste.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we have measured the “supercenter effect,” we are keen to look at potential solutions to this problem. Some existing solutions are based on implementing policies that encourage behavioral shifts in consumers. For example, many cities have adopted a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-pay-as-you-throw-a-waste-expert-explains-173828\">pay-as-you-throw policy</a> that charges people based on the volume of waste generated. </p>\n\n<p>Other solutions are more structural, such as bringing back neighborhood convenience stores and developing stronger circular economy channels. For example, neighborhood convenience stores can play an important role in mitigating the supercenter effect and could allow for smaller, more frequent shopping trips and significantly less waste.</p>\n\n<p>In many cities, <a href=\"https://www.nlc.org/article/2025/05/01/how-cities-can-spark-economic-transformation-through-entrepreneur-led-economic-development\">initiatives promoting local</a> <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/local-and-solidarity-economies-are-helping-some-regions-balance-economic-competitiveness\">vendors and stores</a> are gaining momentum. Such solutions would not only encourage sustainable consumption but also have benefits for local economic growth by promoting small businesses that have historically <a href=\"https://sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/\">accounted for 62%</a> of net new job creation. </p>\n\n<p>A second solution entails leveraging the “reuse economy,” which can provide a back-end channel for circulating surplus and used goods. While both offline and online reuse channels exist – through the likes of thrift stores, food banks and Facebook Marketplace, for example – they currently remain vastly underused. </p>\n\n<p>Identifying and aggressively implementing such solutions might turn out to be both economically meaningful and environmentally beneficial. But more work needs to be done to figure out which solutions are more effective, and why.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267939/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Suvrat Dhanorkar does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

We just move, one step after another, without ever thinking about what it takes to make that happen. Yet every single step is an extraordinary act of coordination, driven by precise timing between spinal cord, brain, nerves, muscles and joints. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, people have used stopwatches, cameras or trained eyes to assess walking and its deficits. However, recent technological advances such as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/motion-capture\">motion capture</a>, wearable sensors and data science methods can record and quantify characteristics of step-by-step movement.</p>\n\n<p>We are researchers <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C22&amp;q=%22Azarang+Asadi%22&amp;btnG=\">who study</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=lj03RM8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">biomechanics and</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rPBARXkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">human performance</a>. We and other researchers are increasingly applying this data to improve human movement. These insights not only help athletes of all stripes push their performance boundaries, but they also support movement recovery for patients through personalized feedback. Ultimately, motion could become another vital sign.</p>\n\n<h2>From motion data to performance insights</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers around the world combine physiology, biomechanics and data science to decode human movement. This interdisciplinary approach sets the stage for a new era where machine learning algorithms find patterns in human movement data collected by continuous monitoring, yielding insights that improve health. </p>\n\n<p>It’s the same technology that powers your fitness tracker. For example, the <a href=\"https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Engineering_and_technology/Aerospace_engineering/IMU/\">inertial measurement unit</a> in the Apple Watch records motion and derives metrics such as step count, stride length and cadence. Wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement units, record thousands of data points every second. The raw data reveals very little about a person’s movement. In fact, the data is so noisy and unstructured that it’s impossible to extract any meaningful insight. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"On the left, an illustration of a skeleton overlays a photo of a person on a treadmill; on the right, a series of horizontal jagged lines\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=316&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=316&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=316&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699820/original/file-20251031-56-wu85s.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=397&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A study participant walks on a treadmill in our lab while a motion sensor attached to the subject’s ankle captures acceleration signals.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Human Performance and Nutrition Research Institute</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>That is where <a href=\"https://signalprocessingsociety.org/our-story/signal-processing-101\">signal processing</a> comes into play. A signal is simply a sequence of measurements tracked over time. Imagine putting an inertial measurement unit on your ankle. The device constantly tracks the ankle’s movement by measuring signals such as acceleration and rotation. These signals provide an overview of the motion and indicate how the body behaves. However, they often contain unwanted background noise that can blur the real picture. </p>\n\n<p>With mathematical tools, researchers can filter out the noise and isolate the information that truly reflects how the body is performing. It’s like taking a blurry photo and using editing tools to make the picture clear. The process of cleaning and manipulating the signals is known as signal processing.</p>\n\n<p>After processing the signals, researchers use machine learning techniques to transform them into interpretable metrics. <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning\">Machine learning</a> is a subfield of artificial intelligence that works by finding patterns and relationships in data. In the context of human movement, these tools can identify features of motion that correspond to key performance and health metrics. </p>\n\n<p>For example, our team at the Human Performance and Nutrition Research Institute at Oklahoma State University estimated <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/vo2-max\">fitness capacity</a> without requiring exhaustive physical tests or special equipment. Fitness capacity is how efficiently the body can perform physical activity. By combining biomechanics, signal processing and machine learning, we were able to estimate fitness capacity using data from just a few steps of our subjects’ walking. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond fitness, walking data offers even deeper insights. Walking speed is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2010.1923\">a powerful indicator of longevity</a>, and by tracking it, we could learn about people’s long-term health and life expectancy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"an outline of a person walking, with lines connected to graphs and text representing data\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699821/original/file-20251031-56-matsz8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Wearables capture motion signals, and through signal processing and machine learning, the data produces valuable health metrics such as risk of falling.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Human Performance and Nutrition Research Institute</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>From performance to medicine</h2>\n\n<p>The impact of these algorithms extends far beyond tracking performance such as steps and miles walked. They can be applied to support rehabilitation and prevent injuries. Our team is developing a machine learning algorithm to detect when an athlete is at an elevated risk of injury just by analyzing their body movement and detecting subtle changes. </p>\n\n<p>Other scientists have used similar approaches to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2025.112562\">monitor motor control impairments</a> following a stroke by continuously assessing how a patient’s walking patterns evolve, determining whether motor control is improving, or if the patient is compensating in any way that could lead to future injury.</p>\n\n<p>Similar tools can also be used to inform treatment plans based on each patient’s specific needs, moving us closer to true personalized medicine. In Parkinson’s disease, these methods have been used to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-024-12611-x\">diagnose the condition</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-023-00581-2\">monitor its severity</a> and detect episodes of walking difficulties to prompt <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/titb.2009.2036165\">cues to the patients</a> to resume walking.</p>\n\n<p>Others have used these techniques to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-021-00815-5\">design and control wearable assistive devices</a> such as exoskeletons that improve mobility for people with physical disabilities by generating power at precisely timed intervals. In addition, researchers have evaluated movement strategies in military service members and found that those with poor biomechanics <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.868002\">had a higher risk of injury</a>. Others have used wrist-worn wearables to detect <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000003507\">overuse injuries</a> in service members. At their core, these innovations all have one goal: to restore and improve human movement.</p>\n\n<h2>Motion as a vital sign</h2>\n\n<p>We believe that the future of personalized medicine lies in dynamic monitoring. Every step, jump or squat carries information about how the body functions, performs and recovers. With advances in wearable technology, AI and cloud computing, real-time movement monitoring and biofeedback are likely to become a routine part of everyday life. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine an athlete’s shoe that warns them before an injury occurs, clothing for the elderly that detects and prevents a fall before it occurs, or a smartwatch that detects early signs of stroke based on walking patterns. Combining biomechanics, signal processing and data science turns motion into a vital sign, a real-time reflection of your health and well-being.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266671/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Matthew Bird has previously received funding from the Department of Defense.

Meat-eating carnivores tend to have sharp teeth to sink into their prey, while herbivores tend to have flatter teeth to grind down their plant-based meals.</p>\n\n<p>Some animals also use their pearly whites for specialized purposes <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-ivory-and-why-does-it-belong-on-elephants\">like digging or fighting</a>. Tusks, like you see in elephants, walruses and warthogs, are one special kind of teeth – they <a href=\"https://www.burkemuseum.org/news/fossil-dental-exams-reveal-how-tusks-first-evolved\">grow continuously</a> for as long as the animal is alive.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, no matter what you use them for, teeth wear down. This is good news if you’re a rodent, such as a beaver or a rat. Because their teeth never stop growing, rodents rely on gnawing and chomping to <a href=\"https://www.aiwc.ca/blog/rodents-and-their-ever-growing-teeth/\">grind their teeth down</a> so they don’t grow so long that they cause problems.</p>\n\n<p>Some animals deal with wear and tear by continuously developing new teeth as their old ones fall out. Sharks and crocodiles, for example, are what scientists call polyphyodont: They can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1213202110\">grow nearly infinite sets of teeth</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Nile crocodile rests on sand with its mouth open, revealing a full set of sharp teeth.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/684074/original/file-20250805-62-bbo7jh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some toothy animals just grow new replacement teeth when the old ones fall out.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nile-crocodile-opening-its-mouth-showing-teeth-pictured-in-news-photo/1249132054?adppopup=true\">Marcos del Mazo/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Like most mammals, humans are diphyodont: We have two sets of teeth – baby teeth and adult teeth.

How did two sets become standard for human beings?</p>\n\n<h2>How human teeth develop</h2>\n\n<p>Most people are born with no teeth showing in their mouths at all, even though your baby teeth start developing before you’re even born. Baby teeth usually start poking through the gums when you’re <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/baby/babys-development/teething/baby-teething-symptoms/\">between 6 and 8 months old</a>. Sometimes when dentists take X-rays to check for cavities or other problems, they can see adult teeth growing within the gums.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Black-and-white image shows a line of small teeth with roots – under two are two larger white teeth\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699607/original/file-20251030-56-3qqnsw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">X-ray of a child’s mouth shows two adult teeth growing in the jaw below the visible baby teeth.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">David Avenetti</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Baby teeth are relatively small because they need to fit in the small faces of babies and little kids. As you grow older and your face gets bigger, you have room in your mouth for more and larger teeth. Teeth have different sizes and shapes, depending on their purpose. Human front teeth are good at biting into things and tearing off a piece of food. Your back teeth are good at chewing foods into smaller bits before you swallow.</p>\n\n<p>Most kids <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/when-do-kids-start-losing-teeth\">lose their first baby tooth</a> when they’re between 5 and 6 years old, and the process slowly continues until you’re between 10 and 12 years old and all 20 of your original choppers have fallen out.</p>\n\n<p>During that same time, your adult, or permanent, teeth gradually take their spots in your mouth. They’re bigger than your baby teeth and can help you chew more food at once. Eventually you have a set of 28, with the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-do-people-have-wisdom-teeth-216148\">potential of four more wisdom teeth</a> at the very back. Some people just naturally don’t ever grow wisdom teeth, some have wisdom teeth that don’t fit their jaws and need to be removed, and some have big, wide smiles with 32 teeth.</p>\n\n<p>So, getting two sets of teeth means your teeth fit the size of your face as you grow, and helps make sure you can chew food your entire life.</p>\n\n<h2>Baby teeth deserve gentle care</h2>\n\n<p>You might be thinking that if baby teeth are just going to fall out, they can’t be that important. But that’s not true.</p>\n\n<p>If you were a shark, every time you got a bunch of cavities or chipped a tooth, you’d just grow a new one and keep on chewing. But unlike sharks or crocodiles or even manatees, we humans only get two sets of teeth. By taking care of your baby teeth, you can keep them healthy and make sure they stay right where they belong until they’re ready to fall out.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t take care of your baby teeth, they can wind up with lots of cavities. If the cavities get too large or teeth become infected, they may need to be removed by the dentist. Not only is this process not fun, but taking out baby teeth too early <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ortho.2023.100816\">can create problems for your adult teeth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can wind up with not enough space for your adult teeth to come in – that is, what dentists call “erupt” – into the right spots. This issue happens in part because the other teeth around where the baby tooth was will shift and may move into the space where your adult teeth are supposed to come in. Teeth can get stuck in the jaw and not erupt, or your teeth can be crowded in your mouth. If there is a mismatch between the size of your teeth and the size of your jaws, an orthodontist might <a href=\"https://aaoinfo.org/treatments/braces/\">attach braces to your teeth</a> to reposition them so they all fit.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the future of teeth?</h2>\n\n<p>Because people can live long lives, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\">70 or 80 years or more</a>, many outlive their teeth even if they do their best to take care of them. While there are lots of options for artificial teeth – like removable dentures or even dental implants, which are fake teeth that are screwed into your jaws – it’s not quite the same as having natural teeth.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Digital generated image of artificial implant tooth with a screw at its base as it affixes to jaw\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699815/original/file-20251031-56-n9ikkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Taking good care of your teeth decreases the chance you’ll need an artificial replacement someday.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/implant-tooth-installation-royalty-free-image/1359996183\">Andriy Onufriyenko/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>If you break a bone, it heals because you can grow new bone to patch up the part that broke. Scientists call this process fracture healing. <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/mouth-and-teeth-anatomy/are-teeth-bones\">Human teeth aren’t bone</a> and, unfortunately, do not heal themselves. Unlike your bones, which are mostly composed of a structural protein your body makes called collagen, your teeth are primarily made up of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27185852\">minerals such as calcium-rich hydroxyapatite</a>. In some ways, teeth are closer to being like hard stones than living bones.</p>\n\n<p>Regenerative dentistry is the study of how teeth grow and develop, with the goal of ultimately designing new ways to repair and replace our teeth. Scientists are working hard to figure out ways to grow new teeth or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.identj.2023.07.008\">help existing teeth regenerate</a>. They’re learning about <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/lab-grown-teeth-might-become-an-alternative-to-fillings-following-research-breakthrough\">the environment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64188957/human-tooth-regrowth-trials-japan/\">materials needed to grow new teeth</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For now, the best thing you can do is take good <a href=\"https://www.mychildrensteeth.org/resources-for-parents/\">care of the teeth you have</a> and keep the gums and bones that support them healthy. Brush your teeth twice a day with <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/toothpastes\">toothpaste that contains fluoride</a>, and floss once a day. Try to limit sugary, sticky foods and drinks – a good diet keeps your whole body healthy, not just your teeth. See a dentist regularly, and protect your teeth from injury.</p>\n\n<p>Being kind to your teeth now can help your future self have a beautiful, healthy smile. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

Even better, their reply in their native tongue comes through perfectly clear to you. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to artificial intelligence, neither of you is lost in translation.

We have devoted our careers to this field because we deeply believe in the lasting and transformative value of learning and speaking languages beyond one’s mother tongue. </p>\n\n<h2>Lessons from past language ‘disruptions’</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time a new technology has promised massive disruption to learning languages.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, language learning startups such as Duolingo aimed to make acquiring a language easier than ever, in part by gamifying language. While these apps have certainly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-51447-0_5-1\">made learning more accessible</a> to more people, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3138/9781781797020-011\">our research shows</a> most platforms and apps have failed to fully replicate the inherently social process of learning a language. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"phone displays the Duolingo app with an icon of the face of a green bird\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696580/original/file-20251015-66-pjmvg5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Duolingo had over 113 million monthly active users at the end of 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/duolingo-on-app-store-displayed-on-a-phone-screen-is-seen-news-photo/2218621782\">Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>One thing’s clear: The massive popularity of language apps shows there’s still strong demand <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/language-services-market-111514\">for language learning</a>, despite a <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2023/11/16/foreign-language-enrollment-sees-steepest-decline-record\">sharp decline in formal education settings</a>. Duolingo alone had <a href=\"https://investors.duolingo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/duolingo-achieves-54-dau-growth-and-40-revenue-growth-third\">113.1 million monthly active users</a> around the world at the end of 2024, a 36% increase over the prior year. This is about 10 times more than the number of students who take languages other than English in U.S. schools. </p>\n\n<h2>The meaning of learning a language</h2>\n\n<p>Numbers aside, the gold standard of language learning is the ability to follow and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/I.1.1\">contribute to a live group conversation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since World War II, government departments and education programs recognized that <a href=\"https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001631056\">text-centered grammar-translation</a> methods did little to support real interaction. Interpersonal conversational competence gradually became the main goal of language classes. While technologies you can put in your ear or wear on your face now promise to revolutionize interpersonal interaction, their usefulness in such conversations actually falls along a spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>At one end, you have simple tasks you have to navigate while visiting a city where they speak a different language, like checking out of a hotel, buying a ticket at a kiosk or finding your way around town. That is, people from different backgrounds working together to achieve a goal – a successful checkout, a ticket purchase or getting to the famous museum you want to visit. Any mix of <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203113493-5/theorizing-competence-translingual-practice-contact-zone-suresh-canagarajah\">languages, gestures or tools</a> – even AI tools – can help in this context. In such cases, where the goal is clear and both parties are patient, shared English or automated interpretation can get the job done while bypassing the hard work of language learning.</p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>At the other end, identity matters as much as content. Meeting your in-laws, introducing yourself at work, welcoming a delegation or presenting to a skeptical audience all involve trust and social capital. Humor, idioms, levels of formality, tone, timing and body language shape not just what you say but who you are.</p>\n\n<p>The effort of learning a language communicates respect, trust and a willingness to see the world through someone else’s eyes. We believe language learning is one of the most demanding and rewarding forms of deep work, building cognitive resilience, empathy, identity and community in ways technology struggles to replicate. </p>\n\n<p>The 2003 movie “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/\">Lost in Translation</a>,” which depicts an older American man falling in love with a much younger American woman, was not about getting lost in the language but delved into issues of interculturality and finding yourself while exposed to the other.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/top-statistics-global-migration-migrants\">accelerating mobility</a> due to climate migration, remote work and retirement abroad all increase the need to learn languages – not just translate them. Even those staying in place often seek deeper connections through language as <a href=\"https://www.cal.org/heritage-language-education-in-the-u-s-research-policies-and-practice\">learners with familial and historical ties</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"two students wearing glasses sit at at table looking at a paper\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693688/original/file-20250930-66-6fqpr7.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Spanish learner from China negotiates meaning with an English learner from Mexico in California.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Gabriel Guillén, 2025</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Where AI falls short</h2>\n\n<p>The latest AI technologies, such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/personaltech/new-airpods-language-translation-feature.html\">those used by Apple’s newest AirPods</a> to instantly interpret and translate, certainly are powerful tools that will help a lot of people interact with anyone who speaks a different language in ways previously only possible for someone who spent a year or two studying it. It’s like having your own personal interpreter.</p>\n\n<p>Yet relying on interpretation carries <a href=\"https://pubs.lib.umn.edu/index.php/reconsidering/article/view/580\">hidden costs</a>: distortion of meaning, loss of interactive nuance and diminished interpersonal trust.  </p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/etd/1534/\">ethnography of American learners</a> with strong motivation and near limitless support found that falling back on speaking English and using technology to aid translation may be easier in the short term, but this undercuts long-term language and integration goals. Language learners constantly face this choice between short-term ease and long-term impact. </p>\n\n<p>Some AI tools help accomplish immediate tasks, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64152/10125/73569\">generative AI apps can support acquisition</a> but can take away the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/6.1.71\">negotiations of meaning</a> from which durable skills emerge.</p>\n\n<p>AI interpretation may suffice for one-on-one conversations, but <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/flan.12783\">learners usually aspire</a> to join ongoing conversations already being had among speakers of another language. Long-term language learning, while necessarily friction-filled, is nevertheless beneficial on many fronts.</p>\n\n<p>Interpersonally, using another’s language fosters both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2011.558894\">cultural</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14790718.2012.714380\">cognitive</a> empathy. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the cognitive benefits of multilingualism are equally well documented: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24158\">resistance</a> to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00326-x\">dementia</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367006910363060\">divergent thinking</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-L-18-0321\">flexibility</a> in shifting <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153485\">attention</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728912000570\">acceptance</a> of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728912000570\">multiple perspectives and explanations</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611432178\">reduced bias</a> in reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>The very attributes <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/in-full/5-region-economy-and-industry-insights/#5-region-economy-and-industry-insights\">companies seek</a> in the AI age – resilience, lifelong learning, analytical and creative thinking, active listening – are all cultivated through language learning.</p>\n\n<h2>Rethinking language education in the age of AI</h2>\n\n<p>So why, in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b138178c-e741-45fe-b053-05420713c04f\">increasingly multilingual U.K.</a> and U.S., are fewer students choosing to learn another language in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b138178c-e741-45fe-b053-05420713c04f\">high school</a> and at <a href=\"https://www.americathebilingual.com/cratering-language-enrollments-reveal-americas-linguistic-divide/\">university</a>? </p>\n\n<p>The reasons are complex. </p>\n\n<p>Too often, institutions <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1111/flan.12783\">have struggled to demonstrate the relevance</a> of language studies. Yet innovative approaches abound, from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003106609-12\">integrating language in the contexts of other subjects</a> and linking it to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.37333/001c.11480\">service and volunteering</a> to connecting students with others through <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261444821000069\">virtual exchanges</a> or community partners via <a href=\"https://www.csiepub.org/index.php/csie/article/view/142\">project-based language learning</a>, all while <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_9quKsoUnoBVDib1RAGUE5kzkWJPSDTiJ64DSfnCXoM/edit?slide=id.g29c60f0150e_0_0#slide=id.g29c60f0150e_0_0\">developing intercultural skills</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So, again, what’s the value of learning another language when AI can handle tourism phrases, casual conversation and city navigation?</p>\n\n<p>The answer, in our view, lies not in fleeting encounters but in cultivating enduring capacities: curiosity, empathy, deeper understanding of others, the reshaping of identity and the promise of lasting cognitive growth.</p>\n\n<p>For educators, the call is clear.

      "content": "<p>It’s unusual for a professional sports franchise to plan a yearlong celebration for a team that didn’t win a championship. </p>\n\n<p>But it is also rare that a group of players represents the vibe and culture of a city so accurately as the Philadelphia 76ers did back in 2001. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout the 2025-2026 NBA season, the <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/sixers/25th-anniversary\">Sixers will honor the 25th anniversary</a> of their legendary 2001 team. The celebration kicks off with the return of Hip-Hop, the muscle-bound rabbit mascot who debuted in 1998 and represented the team for 13 years. Throughout the year the team will wear jerseys and feature court designs from the 2001 season, and it will honor the team and its star player, Allen “The Answer” Iverson, during a <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/sixers/25th-anniversary\">reunion game on Jan. 31, 2026</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/ethnicstudies/people/core-faculty/jared-bahir-browsh\">As a pop culture scholar and director of a program in critical sports studies</a>, I regularly teach about the influence of Iverson, whom I was a big fan of during my elementary school, high school and college years in Philadelphia. I even named my pet guinea pig after the Hall of Fame player.</p>\n\n<h2>A new era</h2>\n\n<p>The City of Brotherly Love is known for its passionate sports fans. Although this passion has been <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/philadelphia-sports-fans-history-aggression-has-city-edge-n839701\">interpreted by some as aggressive</a>, if not <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/philadelphia-eagles-fans-and-the-thrill-of-defeat.html\">barbaric</a>, Philadelphians’ knowledge of and loyalty to their teams has never waned – even as they endured a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/sports/playbook/20081030_Phillies_end_championship_drought_with_Game_5_defeat_of_Rays.html\">25-year championship drought</a> across their four major professional teams.</p>\n\n<p>Before the Philadelphia Phillies won the World Series in 2008, Philadelphia hadn’t had a championship sports team <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/sixers/history/76ers-team-history#1980s\">since 1983</a>. In that year, the Sixers disrupted the dominance of the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, who won every other championship from 1980 to 1988.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A player holding basketball jumps in air as opposing team tries to block a pass.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=402&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700796/original/file-20251106-56-dzgx2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=505&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Philadelphia 76ers play the Boston Celtics at the Spectrum on Nov. 19, 1983, in Philadelphia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/maurice-cheeks-of-the-philadelphia-76ers-dishes-off-to-a-news-photo/2232159211\">James Drake/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Sixers remained competitive for a few more years before Moses Malone was traded in 1986 and Julius Erving – “Dr. J” – retired in 1987. In the decade that followed, a contentious relationship developed between fans and Sixers owner Harold Katz. It intensified when Katz traded fan favorite Charles Barkley in 1992. </p>\n\n<p>In 1996, Comcast Spectacor, owner of the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/sixers-sale-approved/1914430/\">bought the Sixers</a> from Katz and ushered in a new era for the franchise. <a href=\"https://www.xfinitymobilearena.com/plan-your-visit/arena-history\">The team moved to a new arena</a> and hired their former trainer Pat Croce, who had a minority stake in the team, as team president.</p>\n\n<p>That same year, the Sixers won the draft lottery for the first pick of the NBA draft, earning the rights to draft a 6-foot guard from Georgetown University. Iverson not only altered the fortunes of the franchise but became a cultural phenomenon while representing a city known for being <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/philly-sports-fans-consider-themselves-gritty-but-its-merely-a-myth-used-to-fuel-their-passion-245996\">brash and gritty</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Policing Black athletes</h2>\n\n<p>Black athletes, in particular, are often expected to engage in <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/iversons-spirit-brashness-and-his-crossover-made-him-my-role-model/\">respectability politics</a> – a strategy in which marginalized people are expected to abandon parts of their own culture to assimilate to the dominant, often white, culture’s expectations. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-century-ago-a-black-owned-team-ruled-basketball-today-no-black-majority-owners-remain-213439\">Mostly white team owners</a> and fans want them to act a certain way or <a href=\"https://sabr.org/journal/article/negro-league-baseball-black-community-and-the-socio-economic-impact-of-integration/\">avoid speaking out on societal issues such as race</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the earliest, and most visible, challenges to this in sports was <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/jack-johnson-heavyweight-boxer-defied-america\">Jack Johnson</a>, a Black heavyweight boxing champion in 1908 who refused to adhere to social and economic expectations of African Americans in the early 20th century. Johnson taunted his opponents in the ring and flouted his wealth outside of it. Most controversially, he had romantic relationships with white women. </p>\n\n<p>Later, boxing legend <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/delegate/stories-un-archive-muhammad-ali-fights-peace\">Muhammad Ali</a> and Boston Celtics center <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/01/1114795613/racial-justice-pioneer-nba-bill-russell\">Bill Russell</a> also faced criticism for speaking out on civil rights issues.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/unforgivable-blackness/mann-act\">Like Johnson</a>, Ali and Russell were targeted by federal law enforcement. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fbi-kept-tabs-on-muhammad-ali-in-1966-during-nation-of-islam-probe-idUSKBN14511P/\">Ali was suspended from boxing for three years</a> for his refusal to join the military and fight in the Vietnam War. Both Ali and Russell were also tracked by the FBI, and <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/01/nation/1987-essay-by-bill-russells-daughter-detailed-racism-family-faced-mass/\">Russell found his house in the Boston area vandalized</a>, though no one was charged.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Black and white photo of man in suit and tie surrounded by crowd\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700798/original/file-20251106-56-kd9icp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Heavyweight champ Muhammad Ali leaves the armed forces induction center in Houston on April 28, 1967, after refusing to be drafted.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/AliTakesOnArmy1967/3ba1861ea5d4412bb8dfe8f2993fb006/photoAP%20Photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Iverson, meanwhile, was targeted by the criminal justice system before he even reached the NBA. When he was in high school, he was a top college recruit in both basketball and football even as he navigated poverty and instability.</p>\n\n<p>On Feb. 14, 1993, Iverson was at a bowling alley in his hometown of Hampton, Virginia, when a fight broke out. He and three friends were identified by witnesses, despite questionable evidence that they were involved in the altercation. Iverson was charged with “<a href=\"https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/sac/va0400/intro.htm\">maiming by mob</a>” – a crime that originally targeted lynching in Virginia. He was found guilty and sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125870182/a-town-divided-allen-iverson-and-hampton-va\">15 years in prison</a>. </p>\n\n<p>After public outcry and a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/allen-iverson-documentary-things-learned_n_7298826\">high profile interview with Tom Brokaw</a>, Iverson was granted clemency and offered the opportunity to play for coach John Thompson at Georgetown University.</p>\n\n<h2>AI’s authenticity and style</h2>\n\n<p>In the late 1970s some fans and commentators complained the NBA was becoming “<a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/1979/02/26/theres-an-ill-wind-blowing-for-the-nba-attendance-is-slipping-and-the-leagues-tv-ratings-have-plummeted-leading-to-a-lot-of-cries-and-whispers-about-the-real-problems\">too Black</a>,” so in the 1980s the league took a <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/for-michael-jordan-success-as-a-pitchman-required-a-form-of-colorblindness/\">color-blind approach to marketing</a> players such as Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/20/craig-hodges-michael-jordan-nba-chicago-bulls\">Race took a back seat to money</a>, as players of that era largely <a href=\"https://iac.gatech.edu/featured-news/2023/11/michael-jordan\">avoided discussing Black culture</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Once drafted into the NBA, Iverson conveyed an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17459928/basketball-hall-fame-allen-iverson-authenticity-paved-way-today-nba\">authenticity rarely seen in modern sports</a>, where agents and public relation professionals manage their clients’ image and ensure they say the right things to the media. </p>\n\n<p>He had visible tattoos and began wearing his hair in cornrows in his rookie year. He also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3023602/2021/12/20/nba-75-at-no-40-allen-iverson-brought-heart-hustle-and-hip-hop-culture-as-the-answer/\">embraced rap music</a> and hip-hop culture and style.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Three men wearing white hats, white T-shirts and diamond jewelry stand together\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=527&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=527&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/700800/original/file-20251106-56-7ptybr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=527&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Allen Iverson, center, poses with Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy at the 2005 BET Awards.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/allen-iverson-and-young-jeezy-during-2005-bet-awards-after-news-photo/452900029\">Johnny Nunez/WireImage via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>His fearless play on the court <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/allen-iversons-long-hard-road-to-immortality/\">reinforced this image</a>. He had <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/allen-iverson-explained-unbelievable-effort-203900086.html\">relentless energy</a>, took challenging shots and put his body on the line. </p>\n\n<p>In Philadelphia, sports fans also appreciated <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/allen-iverson-misunderstood-memoir-book-tour-atlanta/\">his loyalty to friends and family</a> along with his willingness to speak his mind. </p>\n\n<p>Much like its star player, the Sixers franchise also embraced hip-hop culture, represented in its new rabbit mascot in 1998. Although basketball has had a connection with hip-hop since the 1970s, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hip-hop-50th-anniversary-nba-hisrory-81d0ada460ac2744ac9bd5eda66b6779\">the NBA’s corporate sponsors were uneasy about this relationship</a>. The Sixers’ decision to lean into this culture was notable.</p>\n\n<p>There was concern, particularly from league commissioner <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10377689/whitlock-david-stern-was-bully-got-lucky\">David Stern</a>, that Iverson’s and the Sixers’ embrace of hip-hop culture would alienate certain stakeholders. Stern clashed with Iverson and implemented a league-wide dress code that <a href=\"https://slamonline.com/archives/nba-dress-code-nonsense/\">barred T-shirts, shorts, chain necklaces, sunglasses and even headphones</a> in public appearances. The ban seemed to target the NBA’s <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/style/a/jackson-connor/stylish-nba-players-who-were-affected-by-leagues-dress-code\">young Black players</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Sixers <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/298137-allen-iverson-is-the-most-important-nba-player-since-jordan\">attracted new fans</a> and built their team around <a href=\"https://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/allen-iverson/\">Iverson’s unique offensive skills</a>, surrounding him with unselfish, defense-focused teammates. They hired Larry Brown as head coach and acquired Philadelphia native and Temple graduate Aaron McKie, who became one of <a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/aaron-mckie-allen-iverson-sixers-hall-of-fame-2016\">Iverson’s closest teammates</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The 2001 Finals</h2>\n\n<p>The Sixers started the 2000-2001 season with a 10-game winning streak and later, after a win against the New York Knicks on Feb. 1, 2001, had a 35-11 record. In a loss on Feb. 7 to the Houston Rockets, center Theo Ratliff injured his wrist and had to undergo season-ending surgery. Over the next two weeks the team won six straight games and Iverson was named the MVP of the <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/history-all-star-recap-2001\">2001 NBA All-Star Game</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the need for a big man, however, the Sixers traded four players for top defender and future <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/dikembe-mutombo-tribute-defended-hoop-hope-happiness\">Hall-of-Fame center Dikembe Mutombo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the team adjusted to its roster changes, they stumbled to a 15-11 record in the last 26 games of the regular season, but were still able to earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference.

While there appears to be continued bipartisan support for LIHEAP in Congress, on April 1, 2025, the administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/climate/trump-layoffs-energy-assistance-liheap.html\">laid off the entire staff</a> of the LIHEAP office.

The program’s funding has never been high enough to meet the need. In 2020, LIHEAP provided assistance to just 16% of eligible households.\nOur research has found that, in practice, many households rely on a range of local nonprofits, faith-based organizations and informal networks of family and friends to help them pay their bills and keep the heat on in winter.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"mxDvB\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mxDvB/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>For example, a research participant named Deborah reported that when faced with a utility shut-off, she “drove from church to church to church” in search of assistance. United Way in South Carolina received over <a href=\"https://www.uwflorence.org/_files/ugd/b7350f_6cc04d9d097e42558cecdedb42cf87fe.pdf\">16,000 calls</a> from people seeking help to pay their utility bills in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>These charitable services are an important lifeline for many, especially in the communities we study in the South. However, research has shown that faith-based programs <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Faith_Based/Ho57hxpcGPsC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">do not have the reach</a> of public programs.</p>\n\n<p>Without LIHEAP, the limited funds provided by nonprofits and the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/informal-safety-nets-help-many-americans-with-expenses-people-at-all-income-levels-benefit-from-this-financial-interdependence-242178\">personal connections that people patch together</a> will be stretched even thinner, especially as other charitable services, such as food banks, also <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/31/funding-cuts-food-banks-farmers/82705776007/\">face funding cuts</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s ahead</h2>\n\n<p>Although Congress has chosen to fund LIHEAP for 2026, the government shutdown threatens the program’s ability to reach families in time for the cold months ahead. While summer heat is on the rise, cold-related deaths have been <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2828342\">trending up</a> as well. Cold snaps in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/deaths-cold-storms-ice-snow-freeze.html\">early 2024</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/22/cold-weather-storm-emergency-south\">again in 2025</a> left several people dead from hypothermia. These are preventable deaths that continued LIHEAP assistance could help avoid.</p>\n\n<p>These threats to LIHEAP—especially coming alongside uncertainty about federal food assistance—put the goal of energy affordability for all Americans – and Americans’ lives – in jeopardy. Until <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-rollout-of-clean-technologies-makes-energy-cheaper-not-more-costly\">more affordable energy sources</a>, such as solar and wind power, can be scaled up, an expansion of federal assistance programs is needed, not a contraction.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the reach and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2486\">funding of LIHEAP</a> is one option. Making <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-u-s-needs-better-more-accessible-home-weatherization-programs/\">home weatherization programs</a> more effective is another.</p>\n\n<p>Governments could also <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1783\">require utilities</a> to forgive past-due bills, implement <a href=\"https://liheapch.acf.gov/docs/PIPPupdate.pdf\">percent of income payment plans</a>, and end utility shut-offs. About <a href=\"https://utilitydisconnections.org/\">two dozen states</a> currently have rules to prevent shut-offs during the worst summer heat.</p>\n\n<p>For now, the cuts mean more pressure on nonprofits, faith-based organizations and informal networks. Looking ahead to another winter of freezing temperatures, we can only hope that delays to LIHEAP payments and cuts to LIHEAP staff don’t foreshadow a growing yet preventable death toll.</p>\n\n<p><em>Etienne Toussaint, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, and Ann Eisenberg, a law professor at West Virginia University, contributed to this article.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This is an update to an article <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-moves-to-gut-low-income-energy-assistance-as-summer-heat-descends-and-electricity-prices-rise-256194\">originally published May 13, 2025</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269342/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Conor Harrison receives funding from the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P.
