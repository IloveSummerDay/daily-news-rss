They testify to an <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/firstimpressions0000coll/page/n3/mode/2up\">artistic tradition in ancient Iraq and Syria</a> that remained uninterrupted from the late fourth to first millennia B.C.E. </p>\n\n<p>In essence, a cylinder seal was a small sculpture that served a crucial utilitarian purpose: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004524569\">signing documents</a>. It was generally made of a precious or semiprecious stone such as lapis lazuli, agate or chalcedony. Images and texts were engraved into the stone with a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/intaglio-sculpture\">technique called intaglio</a>. Notably, these engravings would need to be made in reverse of how the markings would look when it was used.</p>\n\n<p>When rolled on a moist clay tablet, these engravings left low-relief markings, signifying that the object’s owner authorized the written document. In this respect, a cylinder seal’s impression is the ancestor of modern handwritten and digital signatures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Three clay artifacts with glyphs and figures inscribed\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=305&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=305&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=305&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698782/original/file-20251027-66-cikwq6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=383&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Clay envelope and tablets from Kültepe-Kanesh (now Turkey), circa 20th-19th centuries BCE.

Mesopotamians extracted diorite from Oman, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, and carnelian and agate from the Indus Valley and other parts of South Asia. </p>\n\n<p>Seals made of these exotic stones were extra valuable, so only the elite could afford them. Often affiliated with the state and temples, these people were typically royalty, high-level bureaucrats and priests. In contrast, people from lower classes used seals made of less valuable materials, such as limestone, clay or glass.</p>\n\n<p>Mesopotamians and their contemporaries in Western Asia expressed their identities not just through the material of their seals but also through the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004524569\">texts and images engraved on them</a>. The seal texts often introduced the owners with their names, genealogies, gender, professions and hometowns. Thanks to this information, researchers know that not just men but also wealthy women owned seals, albeit in much smaller proportions. </p>\n\n<p>Religious identity, too, was communicated via long prayers addressed to personal gods or via images depicting gods and worshippers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Cylinder seal with a scan of the figures inscribed on its surface on the right\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=337&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698946/original/file-20251028-56-5u9l7p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Assyrian cylinder seal from the late ninth to seventh centuries B.C.E., made of chalcedony and inscribed with a cultic scene.

For thousands of years, seal-cutters – the artisans who exclusively specialized in making seals – carved scenes representing daily life and nature, religious rituals, warfare, architectural vistas and mythical stories involving gods, heroes and hybrid creatures such as winged horses and griffins. </p>\n\n<p>Much of this rich imagery was a result of the owners’ personal choices, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004524569\">often referencing their identities</a>. In some exceptional cases, Mesopotamian kings or their aides monitored and approved the designs of the cylinder seals they <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/36064328/Winter_I_J_1987_Legitimization_of_Authority_through_Image_and_Legend_Seals_Belonging_to_Officials_in_the_Administrative_Bureaucracy_of_the_Ur_III_State\">gifted to high-level officials</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many seals seem to have been already carved with the popular cultural motifs before they were sold to clients, although solid archaeological and archival evidence is still needed to confirm this. When a customer bought these premade objects, they may have asked for a new inscription or some adjustments to the imagery. Most known cylinder seals were likely carved anew for elite clients, especially for those from the highest echelons of the society such as royalty.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Cylinder seal with a scan of the figures inscribed on its surface on the right\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=318&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698947/original/file-20251028-56-wvijef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Akkadian cylinder seal made of serpentine, circa 2250-2150 B.C.E., depicting a bull-man wrestling a lion and a nude, bearded hero wrestling a water buffalo.

That’s the key finding from our new study published in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.4185\">medical journal JAMA Pediatrics</a>. </p>\n\n<p>All states require children entering kindergarten to be vaccinated against infectious diseases like measles and polio. Parents can request medical exemptions if, for example, their child has a severe allergy to a vaccine ingredient. But most states also allow nonmedical exemptions based on religious or philosophical beliefs. To examine whether state policy on vaccine exemptions could counter falling vaccination rates, we probed data from approximately 2.8 million kindergartners across multiple states from 2011 to 2023. </p>\n\n<p>California, New York, Maine and Connecticut completely eliminated nonmedical exemptions during this period. In those states, exemption rates fell by 3.2 percentage points on average within three years – meaning tens of thousands more children gained protection against diseases like measles. </p>\n\n<p>We examined rates for all four vaccines that are required in most states for children to attend school: diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella and polio. Vaccination rates increased for all of them after nonmedical exemptions were eliminated. </p>\n\n<p>One common concern with not allowing nonmedical exemptions is that parents would simply seek <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/medical-exemptions-surge-parents-doctors-bypass-vaccine-laws/\">medical exemptions instead</a>. But that didn’t happen in any significant numbers, we found. While California did see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.9242\">an initial uptick in medical exemptions</a> after its 2015 repeal, they declined after the state implemented centralized review processes in 2021. Overall, medical exemptions increased by only 0.4 percentage points – a statistically significant but clinically modest difference.</p>\n\n<p>We also examined <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements\">states that took a more limited approach</a>. Vermont repealed philosophical exemptions but retained religious exemptions in 2015. Washington repealed nonmedical exemptions only for the MMR vaccine in 2019. These partial repeals were less effective, producing smaller and less persistent increases in vaccination rates than those from total repeal.</p>\n\n<p>The timing matters too. Our findings show that vaccination rates rise over time, with the largest increases observed <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.4185\">three to four years</a> after repeal.

Between 2011 and 2023, overall kindergarten exemption rates <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.4185\">more than doubled, from 1.6% to 3.3%</a>. This trend has accelerated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.4251\">during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccines-and-values-when-youre-having-a-tough-conversation-about-medicine-dont-just-pile-on-evidence-listen-to-someones-moral-foundations-243226\">vaccine skepticism has become increasingly mainstream</a></p>\n\n<p>This trend leaves more children vulnerable to preventable diseases. Measles, for example, requires about 95% vaccination coverage to prevent outbreaks, and even small drops below that threshold can leave communities vulnerable. In 2025, the country surpassed <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">1,600 measles cases</a> – the highest count since 1992. Public health experts worry that the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/\">could lose its measles elimination status</a>, which was declared by the World Health Organization in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Our study shows that comprehensive policy changes can meaningfully protect vaccination coverage. When states eliminate religious, philosophical and other nonmedical vaccine exemptions, childhood vaccination rates increase – without parents simply shifting to medical exemptions.</p>\n\n<p>These findings provide valuable evidence in the face of declining vaccination coverage, and they reveal what’s at stake for states considering weakening vaccine requirements. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-floridas-plan-to-end-vaccine-mandates-will-likely-spread-to-other-conservative-states-264734\">In September 2025, Florida announced</a> its plan to <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/florida-vaccine-mandates-ladapo-pediatricians-flu-measles-disease/\">end vaccine mandates</a> for hepatitis B, chickenpox and bacterial meningitis, with seven additional diseases expected to follow. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Our research demonstrates that policy-level solutions work. But they require comprehensive implementation and adequate enforcement mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>We’re now expanding this research to look at a critical question: Do unvaccinated children <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5368-y\">cluster together in certain neighborhoods or communities</a>? Even when a state’s overall vaccination rate looks healthy, there might be specific towns or school districts where rates are dangerously low – leaving those areas vulnerable to disease outbreaks. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding these patterns will help public health officials target interventions for the communities at highest risk for outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268558/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That number has been climbing <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-student-loan-debt-trends-economic-impact\">dramatically over the past few decades</a>. <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio\">About 52% of federal loan borrowers</a> <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/fsawg/datacenter/library/DLPortfoliobyRepaymentPlan.xls\">are on track</a> to repay their loans within 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult for <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/fsawg/datacenter/library/PortfoliobyLoanStatus.xls\">some people</a> to handle their debt levels, and they miss scheduled payments. This is especially true for people who <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/student-loan-default-rate-facts-statistics/#fn-2\">didn’t finish their degrees or who attended for-profit colleges</a>. It can also be challenging for people to repay their loans if they work in public service jobs that don’t pay a lot of money. </p>\n\n<p>A person with an average amount of undergraduate federal student loan debt is paying <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-isnt-cutting-pell-grants-after-all-but-other-changes-could-complicate-financial-aid-for-some-students-265136\">about $299 a month</a> over the course of the 10 years it typically takes to repay the loans. They could be paying considerably more if they have debt from graduate school, as well. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you qualify for student loan forgiveness?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation\">Student loan forgiveness</a> means that after people pay back their federal student loans for a certain number of years, the balance is forgiven by the Department of Education, which issues the loans.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/articles/student-loan-forgiveness/\">two main kinds of forgiveness</a> plans for federal student loans. There are <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\">income-driven repayment plans</a> and <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\">public service loan forgiveness</a> plans. </p>\n\n<p>Income-driven repayment plans are used by people who do not earn enough money to easily meet the monthly payment on the standard 10-year repayment plan. In these cases, <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\">the Department of Education provides options</a> that let you pay no more than 10% to 20% of your discretionary income toward your loans each month. </p>\n\n<p>After the borrower makes the required monthly payments on time for 20 to 30 years, depending on the plan, the federal government will forgive any remaining balance.  </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to know that the amount you are being forgiven may be <a href=\"https://www.studentloanplanner.com/aft-lawsuit-settlement/\">subject to income tax, as of 2026</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Borrowers who work full time for the federal, state, local or tribal government – including in schools and the military – can have their remaining debt forgiven after 10 years of monthly payments through public service <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\">loan forgiveness</a>. This also applies to people working for nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are these standards on federal student loan forgiveness changing?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In March 2025, the Trump administration began <a href=\"https://www.studentloanplanner.com/trump-repealing-pslf/\">slowing the public service loan forgiveness application process</a> for some borrowers. It also vowed to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-public-service-loan-forgiveness/\">scrutinize which public service employers qualify</a> as nonprofit, nonpartisan groups.  </p>\n\n<p>The administration released new rules on Oct. 30 <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/pslf-fact-sheet-112456.pdf\">that will exclude</a> borrowers from receiving new public service loan forgiveness credit if their employers are found to have a “substantial illegal purpose.” This includes organizations that provide support for undocumented immigrants, children who seek medical gender transitions, or for speech the administration deems to support terrorist, violent or discriminatory ideas. My research has shown that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.20505\">public service incentives help attract skilled workers</a> to work for nonprofits and other organizations that try to help people. This shift may make it harder for organizations that help vulnerable communities to attract and retain staff. </p>\n\n<p>Also in March, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.studentloanplanner.com/aft-lawsuit-settlement/\">stopped processing applications for forgiveness</a> under some income-dependent repayment plans, arguing that <a href=\"https://www.mackinac.org/archives/2025/United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%208th%20Circuit%20Student%20Loan%20Decision_Feb2025.pdf\">a recent court ruling</a> that blocked a particular forgiveness plan initiated by then-President Joe Biden applied to other plans as well. </p>\n\n<p>In response, the American Federation of Teachers <a href=\"https://protectborrowers.org/aft-v-ed-update-aft-adds-class-action-plaintiffs/\">filed a lawsuit</a> in March demanding reinstatement of loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers. </p>\n\n<p>In October, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5566117-trump-student-loan-forgiveness-deal-debt-relief/\">the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration reached a deal</a>. Now, the Department of Education will resume processing student loan forgiveness applications for people who need financial help paying off the loans and for people who are public service workers. Still, public service workers might find that their work is now considered to have an “illegal purpose,” according to the White House, challenging their forgiveness. </p>\n\n<p>They also agreed that loans <a href=\"https://www.studentloanplanner.com/aft-lawsuit-settlement/\">eligible for tax-exempt forgiveness through 2025</a> will remain tax-exempt. In 2026, most student loan debt forgiveness will become <a href=\"https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/when-are-student-loan-discharges-taxable\">taxable as income</a>. There is an exception for public service workers and for former students who have been affected by college closures or fraud. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the new agreement mean for people who have student loans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People who are already making monthly payments on existing federal student loans under income-driven repayment can continue to do so. People in a standard 10-year repayment plan who cannot afford their payments should <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\">know their income-driven repayment options</a> and talk to their loan servicer if they wish to consider such a plan. </p>\n\n<p>Also, beginning in 2026, the Education Department will offer a new kind of income-driven repayment plan called the repayment assistance plan. The department will begin phasing out some older <a href=\"https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/student-loan-repayment-assistance-plan-rap\">income-driven plans in 2028</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A large group of people dressed in black robes and graduation caps are seated in rows, except for one person who walks in the aisle.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=417&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699203/original/file-20251029-56-fx6133.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=524&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Boston College students attend their graduation ceremony in May 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/boston-ma-the-boston-college-commencement-was-held-at-news-photo/2215587881?adppopup=true\">David L.

Lower federal debt limits decrease the amount of debt that borrowers can accrue. </p>\n\n<p>People planning to go into public service with the expectation that their loans will be forgiven after 10 years <a href=\"https://studentloansherpa.com/future-pslf/\">should do so with modest caution</a>. Public Service Loan Forgiveness was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2669\">created by Congress</a> to encourage public service careers, making it difficult to fully repeal. On the other hand, the Department of Education has discretion over <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\">which organizations count as public service employers</a>, as the new Oct. 30 rules demonstrate. The department also has discretion over how easily and quickly it processes loan forgiveness applications. </p>\n\n<p>Given the Trump administration’s public skepticism of not only <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-public-service-loan-forgiveness/\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a>, but also <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/\">public service employment in general</a>, it is possible that it would continue to <a href=\"https://studentloansherpa.com/future-pslf/\">erode this incentive</a> for public service workers. </p>\n\n<p>Borrowers can help their case by <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\">annually certifying their employment</a> with an eligible public service employer and by maintaining records of their loan’s eligibility, repayment plan and monthly payments.

Both men see it as a symptom of “woke” culture rather than as a long-standing practice driven by the very nature and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG265.html\">history of the all-volunteer force</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Embracing diversity</h2>\n\n<p>During times of war and between 1948 and 1973, the U.S. military drafted enlistees to fill the ranks. After years of debate, the draft was ended and the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/all-volunteer-force\">established an all-volunteer force in 1973</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.2202/1540-8884.1460/html\">demographic makeup of the military quickly changed</a> as more Black Americans and women chose to join the military. In a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675289\">2007 study of representation in the military</a>, scholars found that Black Americans had been overrepresented in the military for much of the span of the all-volunteer force. And the percentage of Latino service members more than doubled from the late 1980s to the 2000s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Latino service members made up <a href=\"https://prhome.defense.gov/M-RA/Inside-M-RA/MPP/Pop-Rep/2022/\">25% of new enlistees in 2022</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While women remain underrepresented in the military compared with the U.S. population, the shift to the all-volunteer force led to a steady increase in <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/12/22/women-in-the-u-s-military-growing-share-distinctive-profile/\">women’s military participation</a>. Women made up 3% of military personnel in 1973 and <a href=\"https://prhome.defense.gov/M-RA/Inside-M-RA/MPP/Pop-Rep/2022/\">17% in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The military <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675289\">would not have been able to meet personnel needs</a> and <a href=\"https://prhome.defense.gov/M-RA/Inside-M-RA/MPP/Pop-Rep/2022/\">recruitment goals</a> without the disproportionate representation of women, Black Americans, and Latino service members during this post-draft period.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. military embraced this diversity long before the influence of “woke” politics and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/pete-hegseth-speech-takeaways\">Hegseth and Trump claim have undermined the institution</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That embracement has helped the military <a href=\"https://prhome.defense.gov/M-RA/Inside-M-RA/MPP/Pop-Rep/2022/\">enlist between 128,000 and 190,000 new service members</a> annually since the 1990s, even though some armed forces, especially the Army, have struggled to meet their <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/09/26/army-hits-recruiting-target-for-the-first-time-in-2-years/\">recruiting goals in the past few years</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Men form a line in a gym.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698160/original/file-20251023-56-sy3tq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=477&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Men who have signed up to join the U.S. Marines wait to do qualifying pull-ups in New York City on Nov. 16, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/men-who-have-signed-up-to-join-the-u-s-marines-stand-in-news-photo/1355212782?adppopup=true\">Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Expanding the scope</h2>\n\n<p>To fully understand how the military became one of the most diverse American institutions, you need to go back to the foundations of the all-volunteer force. </p>\n\n<p>The primary challenge the military faced in the implementation of the all-volunteer force was how to persuade young Americans to enlist. Large <a href=\"https://history.army.mil/Publications/Publications-Catalog/Modern-Volunteer-Army-Program/\">budgets were set aside for advertising</a>, and military branches worked with advertisers to reach potential recruits. </p>\n\n<p>One of the first steps advertisers took in the mid-1970s was to identify “<a href=\"https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/jwtaccountfiles\">vulnerable target groups</a>.” These groups were targeted based on propensity – the likelihood that an individual would serve regardless of their desire to do so. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=23msp2tp9780252045721\">likelihood of service increased</a> when people felt they had little opportunity outside of the military – whether that meant financial struggles or an inability to afford higher education. </p>\n\n<p>Based on ideas of recruit quality and the traits the military sees as best suited to success in the ranks, the <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=23msp2tp9780252045721\">military has mostly desired to recruit straight and white young men</a>. But these people were more likely to have opportunities outside of the military. So, military leaders had to <a href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=23msp2tp9780252045721\">expand the scope of potential recruits</a> to reach out to groups previously excluded – namely, Black Americans, other people of color and women.</p>\n\n<p>When Hegseth talks about “<a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4318689/secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-addresses-general-and-flag-officers-at-quantico-v/\">fixing decades of decay</a>” in a department gone “<a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4318689/secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-addresses-general-and-flag-officers-at-quantico-v/\">woke</a>,” and when Trump argues that the military will now be “<a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-department-of-defense-leaders-quantico-september-30-2025/\">all based on merit</a>,” they both fail to understand military diversity. </p>\n\n<p>The military didn’t become diverse because it went “woke” or abandoned a merit-based system of promotions. </p>\n\n<p>Military diversity resulted from the exploitative nature of military recruiting. In the all-volunteer force, the most easily persuaded recruits are those in most need of opportunities they can’t find in the civilian world. The very logic behind an all-volunteer force means that the military can’t fill their ranks with white men alone. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An Army recruiter dressed in military garb stands between two posters depicting Black men in the armed forces.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=487&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698412/original/file-20251024-56-6xz8iu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=612&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A U.S. Army recruiter walks between outdoor posters at a mobile interactive recruiting exhibit on May 21, 2005, in Charlotte, N.C.

Legislation developed through bipartisan collaboration is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/723805\">much more likely to become law</a>. We then compared the collaboration patterns of first-term amateurs – legislators who have never held office and were just elected to Congress – against the collaboration patterns of established incumbents.</p>\n\n<p>The difference was clear. Over the past four decades, amateur lawmakers worked across party lines far less often than incumbent lawmakers, both when developing their own legislation and when lending support to other legislators’ proposals.</p>\n\n<p>This finding is not simply a “<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/event/froshintro.pdf\">freshman effect</a>,” observed among all new members of Congress who are still learning its norms and procedures. </p>\n\n<p>First-term representatives who entered Congress with prior elected experience in state or local office engaged in bipartisan cooperation about as frequently as longer-serving incumbents. This suggests that what matters for bipartisan engagement is prior experience in elected office, not a lack of experience in Congress itself.</p>\n\n<h2>The impact on democracy</h2>\n\n<p>Amateur lawmakers are about 10–20 percentage points less likely to engage in bipartisanship during their first term than experienced officeholders. </p>\n\n<p>To put it in perspective, the size of the amateur effect is roughly on par with the collapse in bipartisan relationships that followed the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. After <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html\">some Republican members</a> refused to certify the 2020 presidential election results, Democrats largely stopped working with them in that Congress – a decline in collaboration <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305542400114X\">comparable in scale</a> to what we observe among amateurs.</p>\n\n<p>These effects are likely to continue, with amateurs making up <a href=\"https://ajps.org/2024/04/22/evaluating-inexperience-in-congressional-elections/\">nearly half of all first-term lawmakers</a> in recent years compared to decades past. Notable amateurs elected to Congress include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor-Greene. As new cohorts of amateurs enter office each election cycle, this bipartisanship problem will persist.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/25943195/embed\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25943195/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/25943195\" target=\"_top\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\"> </a></div>\n\n<h2>Learning to value bipartisanship</h2>\n\n<p>Our findings show that amateur lawmakers’ approach to bipartisanship evolves as they gain office-holding experience. By their third term in Congress – about six years after first taking office – the gap in bipartisan behavior between amateurs and experienced legislators largely disappears.</p>\n\n<p>Amateur lawmakers often bring impressive credentials to office – many are <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/vital-stats-businesspeople-in-congress/\">skilled professionals</a>, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo3628341.html\">public figures</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/nearly-all-members-of-the-118th-congress-have-a-bachelors-degree-and-most-have-a-graduate-degree-too/\">highly educated</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, we show that these backgrounds do not necessarily prepare amateurs for the demands of governing. Experience holding state or local office exposes politicians to the practical realities of policymaking. Lacking that experience, amateurs are more likely to view bipartisanship as giving up on their principles rather than a method for serving the public interest. We find that this tendency diminishes only as newcomers gain firsthand experience in the legislative process. </p>\n\n<h2>A global trend with familiar consequences</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. is not alone in this trend toward amateurism. Around the world, political newcomers have surged to power amid frustration with traditional elites. </p>\n\n<p>In Europe, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italian-politics-shaken-up-by-new-legislators/2013/03/24/f09b3768-922b-11e2-bdea-e32ad90da239_story.html\">Italy’s Five Star Movement</a> in 2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/03/macron-french-france-voters-elections-en-marche\">France’s En Marche! movement</a> in 2017 were led by and composed of amateur politicians who framed themselves as anti-establishment outsiders.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, widespread outsider success in the legislature delivered disruption – but not necessarily effective governance. These groups often start with promises of pragmatic reform but <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197665954.001.0001\">struggle once in office</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking toward the midterms</h2>\n\n<p>Heading into 2026, many Americans continue to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/696635/neither-party-dominates-favorability-trust.aspx\">express deep dissatisfaction</a> with their party’s establishment. Public approval of Congress is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/696722/congress-job-rating-sinks-trump-steady.aspx\">near historic lows</a>, and polling shows that many voters believe professional politicians are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/30/more-than-80-of-americans-believe-elected-officials-dont-care-what-people-like-them-think/\">self-interested and out of touch</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2025/06/11/house-candidates-2026-midterm-elections/\">Amateur politicians are once again emerging</a> in response to this discontent, positioning themselves as outsiders who can bring change to Washington. Yet, as our research shows, these newcomers will undervalue the bipartisan relationships needed to govern effectively.</p>\n\n<p>As voters look for change, the challenge will be to balance the desire for fresh perspectives with the experience required to sustain cooperation – and to keep Congress, and democracy, working.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268133/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Cultural differences may sometimes cause countries <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.55317/9781784136383\">such as China and the United States</a> to compete for global influence, but even countries sharing similar values or cultures still find reasons to clash.</p>\n\n<p>So why do countries compete or even go to war? As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s9Rt8GEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">political science scholar</a> researching some of the most <a href=\"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollbook/book/9781803927176/9781803927176.xml\">conflict-prone regions</a> in the world, I find that the answer often comes down to three factors: scarcity, uneven distribution and perception.</p>\n\n<h2>Scarcity leads to hard choices</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.act.nato.int/article/resource-scarcity-and-shifting-dynamics-of-global-security/\">Scarcity is the reality</a> that there are not enough resources – such as food, oil, water and land – to go around.

However, because water is a scarce resource used for drinking, irrigation farming and hydroelectric power, countries such as Egypt and Ethiopia have <a href=\"https://elgar.blog/2025/03/06/beyond-rivalries-how-policy-coordination-can-unlock-lasting-peace-in-the-nile-basin/\">often fought about using the river</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Uneven distribution means relying on others</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FP_202002_great_powers_chapeau.pdf\">Uneven distribution</a> means that not everyone starts off with the same resources. Nations have different levels of power and capabilities, and this shapes how they calculate risk and opportunity when dealing with each other.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, countries concerned about the United States’ dominant power joined together in a rival international organization <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/brics-summit-emerging-middle-powers-g7-g20\">known as BRICS+</a> in 2009. Its founding members include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and several other countries have joined over the years.</p>\n\n<h2>Perception can lead to misunderstanding</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2024/04/what-everyone-should-know-about-the-security-dilemma\">Perception</a> is how countries view each other’s actions. A nation can build up its weapons to be safe from potential attacks, but another nation might view this move as threatening rather than defensive.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.e-ir.info/2008/01/22/the-%E2%80%98security-dilemma%E2%80%99-and-south-asian-nuclear-relations-india-pakistan\">India developed nuclear capability</a> in the 1970s to protect itself, but neighboring Pakistan perceived this as a threat and soon developed its own nuclear weapons. The two countries have since engaged in <a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/2025/four-days-in-may-the-india-pakistan-crisis-of-2025/\">occasional conflict</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Classroom international relations</h2>\n\n<p>Countries have leaders with different personal experiences and backgrounds. To understand how countries interact, it is useful to draw an analogy to a classroom simulation I use in my courses.  </p>\n\n<p>Annabelle and Morgan are two good friends who are taking a course in international relations. For a simulation game, their teacher assigns Annabelle and Morgan to lead two different groups. Their classmates are also assigned to be leaders of a handful of other groups. Each group must decide how to spend its resources, build its industries and form partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>In the game, scarcity was represented by a set number of points both groups could use to purchase resources. Since there were not enough points to provide everyone with everything they desired, each group had to prioritize needs. Should they invest more points in defense, social goods or industry?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Group of people examining a missile on display in a room\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699769/original/file-20251031-56-8bhhp3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Military spending means war is always on the horizon.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/BritainRussiaUkraineWar/05d9578208a54d5caeca7b2b5c8fb880/photo\">AP Photo/Kin Cheung</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Annabelle’s team started with 100 points and Morgan’s team started with 30. That uneven distribution mattered. Annabelle’s group could comfortably invest in industry, while Morgan’s had to focus on survival. Morgan’s group had to decide whether to trust more resource-rich groups and grow their industry points through trade, or find allies among groups with lots of military resources to prepare for potential conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Perception came in when Morgan’s team was not sure how Annabelle’s team was spending its points. If they were spending many points on military, they could attack another group and steal its points. To protect her group, Morgan decided to form an alliance with two other groups. In return, Annabelle’s group perceived the alliance as a threat and started spending more points on military.</p>\n\n<p>In the final round of the game, Morgan’s new alliance invaded Annabelle’s group and took most of their resource points. Annabelle felt betrayed, since she assumed her friendship with Morgan would allow their groups to work together. Morgan felt uneasy but also justified. She did not know how other members of Annabelle’s group would decide to act, so she prioritized her own group’s safety.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the game, Annabelle and Morgan were angry and frustrated with each other and their friendship was strained.</p>\n\n<h2>Cooperation turns into conflict</h2>\n\n<p>Even countries that share common goals or values sometimes compete, and the motivations are rarely simple. </p>\n\n<p>Nations cooperate because it helps them grow, but they also take actions to protect themselves. When two countries compete over similar resources, and when their power balance is not clear, they can get the wrong idea about each other’s actions and engage in conflict. At the extreme, they may even go to war.</p>\n\n<p>Competition and mistrust can arise even among friends who share similar goals. Similarly, while every country might want peace and stability, the forces of scarcity, uneven distribution and perception make it impossible for everyone to get along all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Still, understanding these realities can help countries to build trust and work toward a shared respect that makes peace more likely.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

Over the past decade, rents in these parks <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5519427/some-mobile-home-owners-say-theyre-being-priced-out-by-rising-lot-rent\">have risen 45%</a>, according to census data. Once a park is sold, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980251335540\">the risk of eviction rises significantly in the following year</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://law.richmond.edu/faculty/cp6sz/\">I’m a poverty law attorney in Virginia</a>, and many of my clients are residents of mobile home parks. Over the past four years, I’ve watched their communities get sold, one by one, to large investment firms. Many of them are desperately struggling to protect their homes – for some, their only source of wealth – in the face of exploding rents <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2022/11/02/a-hedge-fund-linked-company-bought-a-mobile-home-park-many-residents-were-told-to-pay-hundreds-more-or-be-evicted/\">and threats of eviction</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>The immovable mobile home</h2>\n\n<p>Today, the term “mobile home” <a href=\"https://socialchangenyu.com/review/defending-the-right-to-remain-for-mobile-home-residents-under-virginia-law/\">is a misnomer</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, mobile homes were <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-01-27-bk-507-story.html\">trailers designed for travelers and workers living near factories</a>. With so many veterans returning home after World War II, trailers provided an easy and affordable way for them to obtain housing in the face of shortages.

Those with higher incomes bought houses, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/800007\">those with less means continued to live in mobile homes</a>. Eventually, mobile home communities cropped up throughout the country as places for people to park their mobile homes for months, years or permanently. </p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, mobile homes are more often called “manufactured homes.” They are assembled in factories and rarely move once they’ve been purchased and settled. In fact, more than 90% of manufactured homes <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/manufactured-insecurity/paper\">never move from their original site</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://mhinsider.com/manufactured-housing-industry-trends-statistics/\">around 20.6 million Americans</a> live in a mobile or manufactured home. About one-third of mobile homes <a href=\"https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4179&amp;context=cklawreview\">are located in mobile home communities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In these communities, the residents usually own the home itself, but they rent the lot that the home sits on. They are responsible for the upkeep of their home, but the park owners are responsible for park infrastructure, including street maintenance and sewage systems.</p>\n\n<p>Although many Americans still think of these homes as mobile, they’re prohibitively expensive to move. Many have had the wheels or hitches removed years ago. Additionally, many owners of trailers or manufactured homes have invested in additions, such as porches or extra rooms, that have made these homes even more difficult to relocate.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A robin-egg blue mobile home with fencing, a concrete front steps and a concrete front porch.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=381&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=381&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=381&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=479&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=479&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699280/original/file-20251029-56-obe5fx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=479&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Starting in the 1950s, mobile homes became more permanent fixtures, with owners building out additions such as porches, fences and walkways.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/trailer-in-trailer-park-news-photo/1156660518?adppopup=true\">Found Image Holdings/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Private equity swoops in</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap\">According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition</a>, no state has enough affordable housing for those with the lowest incomes. </p>\n\n<p>In the midst of a housing affordability crisis, mobile homes are seen as a way for those with limited incomes <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/economy/manufactured-mobile-home-affordable-housing\">to generate wealth and access homeownership</a>. Indeed, over half of all manufactured homeowners <a href=\"https://pestakeholder.org/pesp-private-equity-manufactured-housing-tracker/#mh_tracker\">earn less than US$50,000 a year, and one-third are over age 60</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, this type of homeownership is becoming more difficult to maintain for many due to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/03/1033910731/why-are-investors-buying-up-mobile-home-parks-and-evicting-residents\">increased buyout of mobile home parks by large investment firms</a> – a trend that mirrors the rest of the housing market. </p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, housing is being treated as a commodity rather than an essential social good – what’s sometimes called the “<a href=\"https://shelterforce.org/2022/08/09/the-financialization-of-housing-and-its-implications-for-community-development/\">financialization of the housing market</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>For private equity firms, <a href=\"https://primior.com/why-real-estate-private-equity-returns-are-beating-market-expectations-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">housing has been a fruitful investment</a>. But in order to maximize returns on their investments, they usually increase rents and cut costs. Company leadership is often totally divorced from their tenants; instead, they hire on-site and regional managers who exercise disproportionate control over evictions and rule enforcement. Overall, this financialization has transformed the way those with limited incomes are able to obtain shelter – including the owners of mobile homes.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, manufactured home communities were largely “mom-and-pop” enterprises. Though they were still subjected to abusive practices, tenants usually knew their landlords and saw them often, and rents were much more stable.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A teenager on skis traverses a snowy mobile home park.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=404&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699296/original/file-20251029-56-j1747g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Since Aspen, Colo., is one of the most expensive places to live in the country, mobile homes are the only way for some locals to get their foot in the door of homeownership.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/teenager-skis-back-to-his-familys-home-in-a-mobile-home-news-photo/2066163457?adppopup=true\">RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In 2020 and 2021, <a href=\"https://pestakeholder.org/pesp-private-equity-manufactured-housing-tracker/#mh_tracker\">institutional investors accounted for</a> 23% of all manufactured home park purchases, up from 13% between 2017-2019. Now, 23 private equity firms <a href=\"https://pestakeholder.org/pesp-private-equity-manufactured-housing-tracker/#mh_tracker\">own over 1,800 parks in the U.S</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once bought, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5519427/some-mobile-home-owners-say-theyre-being-priced-out-by-rising-lot-rent\">lot rents usually begin rising</a>. Mobile home park residents are especially vulnerable due to their circumstances: Since their homes are so difficult to move, they are essentially trapped when faced with rising lot rents. One study of Florida mobile home communities found that in the months after a park sale, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980251335540\">eviction filings increased by 40%</a>. Residents often find themselves forced to choose between paying exorbitant costs to move their home or paying unaffordable lot rents.</p>\n\n<h2>State laws put the squeeze on tenants</h2>\n\n<p>Because they’re so unique, manufactured home communities are often governed by a special set of state laws.</p>\n\n<p>In my state, Virginia, the <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/manufactured-home-lot-rental-act/\">Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act</a> covers rules that park owners and residents must follow. If someone is evicted for failing to pay their lot rent, they still own their home but can no longer live in the park.</p>\n\n<p>Often, states impose short time frames for someone to move their home following an eviction. In North Carolina, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_44A/GS_44A-2.pdf\">a tenant has just 21 days</a> to remove the manufactured home from the park following an eviction judgment. In Virginia, a homeowner has 90 days after being evicted <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55.1/chapter13/section55.1-1316/\">to move or sell their mobile home</a>, but they must continue paying rent during that time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"People wearing masks and holding signs surround a police car in front of a mobile home park.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699287/original/file-20251029-56-l8ij09.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Residents protest the sale of a mobile home park in Bell, Calif., in 2021.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/activists-block-a-bell-police-officer-from-videotaping-them-news-photo/1232542716?adppopup=true\">Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In many states, if a resident fails to move their home in time, the park owner may repossess the home or move it. Even if the resident lives in a state that continues to protect ownership of the mobile home against park owners, it is often difficult to enforce, as park owners may now have a lien on the mobile home for any amount the resident owes. The result is that many residents who are evicted lose their home. </p>\n\n<h2>Putting power back in the hands of residents</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, only 22 states have laws <a href=\"https://www.nclc.org/resources/existing-park-conversion-laws/\">that require advance notice to residents of park sales</a>. Most simply provide a timeline for owners to inform park residents of their intent to sell.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, many states are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/21/nx-s1-5445018/some-states-aim-to-protect-residents-as-private-investors-buy-up-mobile-home-parks\">coming up with strategies</a> to keep residents from being forced out and help them assume ownership of the parks.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.mainesenate.org/governor-signs-sen-reny-bill-to-establish-and-fund-the-manufactured-housing-community-and-mobile-home-park-preservation-and-assistance-fund/\">Maine passed a law</a> that gives park residents a right of first refusal if their park is up for sale. The law also levies a fee for out-of-state investors who buy parks, which can put residents in a better position to purchase the parks where they live. </p>\n\n<p>In other cases, residents have banded together to buy the park by forming a cooperative with external support. They then apply for financing and purchase the park. <a href=\"https://rocusa.org/the-process/#theprocess\">Resident Owned Communities USA</a> is one example of an organization that works to support resident ownership in manufactured home parks. </p>\n\n<p>Many advocates are also pushing for rent control policies in mobile home parks, limiting the amount that new owners can raise rents annually. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/2019/07/new-law-expands-protections-for-manufactured-homeowners-and-tenants-in-new-york/\">New York state passed a law</a> limiting annual rent hikes in mobile home parks to 3%, though this can climb to 6% annually in certain circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Additional solutions include limiting evictions to narrow circumstances, tightening lot lease contracts to give residents additional protections and <a href=\"https://sites.utexas.edu/gentrificationproject/8-tools-for-preserving-mobile-home-parks/adopt-zoning-protections-for-existing-mobile-home-parks/\">strengthening zoning rights</a> for existing mobile home parks.</p>\n\n<p>In my practice, I see park residents eager to maintain their long-standing homes and communities in the face of outside investors and unresponsive local governments. But until these solutions are widely adopted, residents will continue to lose their wealth – and with it, this crucial path to homeownership.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264456/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I represent tenants facing eviction from mobile home parks, as well as tenant associations in mobile home parks advocating against displacement. </span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>When corporate crises hit, the public looks to the CEO. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTdgUGNVirI\">product recalls</a> to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/activision-ceo-apologizes-employees-1235038472/\">workplace discrimination</a>, to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2017/04/11/united-airlines-oscar-munoz-full-responsibility/\">customer mistreatment scandals</a>, CEOs are often thrust into the spotlight and forced to apologize.</p>\n\n<p>But do the exact words they choose really matter?</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://facultyweb.kennesaw.edu/pgala4/index.php\">professor of marketing</a>, and my preliminary research suggests the answer is yes. In fact, they can even move stock prices.</p>\n\n<h2>A tale of 2 apologies</h2>\n\n<p>Consider two examples from the not-too-distant past. When Samsung Electronics had to <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2016/Samsung-Recalls-Galaxy-Note7-Smartphones\">recall 2.5 million smartphones</a> in 2016 due to battery fires, the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13558442/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-apology-ad\">ran full-page ads in major American newspapers</a> that said, “We are truly sorry.” Despite the apology, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-7-share-prices-dives-phone-recall\">Samsung’s stock continued falling</a>, wiping out billions of dollars in market value.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast that with a famous case: <a href=\"https://publichealth.uic.edu/news-stories/people-politics-and-poison-the-tylenol-murders-revisited-forty-years-later/\">the 1982 Tylenol crisis</a>, in which seven people died after taking capsules that a still-unidentified criminal had laced with cyanide, circumventing the company’s safety protocols. The then-CEO of Tylenol’s parent company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, said “I apologize” to consumers and immediately ordered a nationwide recall, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982\">costing the company over US$100 million</a>. His direct acknowledgment of responsibility and swift action helped restore public trust and <a href=\"https://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/02C2/Johnson%20&amp;%20Johnson.htm\">became a case study</a> in effective crisis leadership. The company’s stock price <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ/history/?period1=347241600&amp;period2=441763200&amp;interval=capitalGain%7Cdiv%7Csplit&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1wk&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true\">didn’t take much of a hit</a>, either.</p>\n\n<p>While the two cases are different in many ways, together they illustrate a pattern my colleagues and I observed in our study: Markets respond differently to “I apologize” versus “We apologize.”</p>\n\n<h2>Investors reward personal accountability</h2>\n\n<p>I collaborated with marketing professors <a href=\"https://business.depaul.edu/faculty/faculty-a-z/Pages/jennifer-tatara.aspx\">Jennifer H. Tatara</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samford.edu/business/directory/Peters-Courtney\">Courtney B. Peters</a> to analyze 224 corporate apologies between 1996 and 2023. Using <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eventstudy.asp\">event-study methods</a> common in finance, we tracked unusual stock returns around apology announcements and linked them to how CEOs framed their statements.</p>\n\n<p>Our results, which we are preparing for publication, were striking. CEOs who said “I apologize” often saw short-term stock returns rise by a statistically significant amount. CEOs who said “We apologize” saw no such effect. Saying “I apologize” lessens the market penalty by roughly 86%, we found.</p>\n\n<p>We think this is because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2018.12.007\">markets reward leaders</a> who take individual responsibility. “I” signals personal accountability and decisiveness. “We,” by comparison, dilutes ownership of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>But context matters, we found. When we zeroed in on diversity-related cases – those involving mistreatment based on race, gender, disability or LGBTQ+ status, for example – the positive effect of “I apologize” weakened or disappeared. </p>\n\n<p>That’s because investors often interpret diversity crises as signs of <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail\">systemic failure</a>, rather than isolated mistakes. In those cases, investors, employees and the public may expect accountability that goes beyond the CEO. A lone “I apologize” can seem hollow, while “We apologize” may resonate more by acknowledging shared institutional responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Beyond CEOs: Why stakeholders should care</h2>\n\n<p>Apologies are among the most scrutinized executive communications. Their effects ripple across different audiences.</p>\n\n<p>For investors, apology language provides <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/research-for-a-corporate-apology-to-work-the-ceo-should-look-sad\">a real-time signal</a> of leadership quality and future governance. Our research shows these signals are strong enough to move stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>For corporate boards, an apology can be as important as a balance sheet in shaping market perceptions. Our research suggests that boards should insist leaders prepare for crisis communications as a standard part of risk management.</p>\n\n<p>For employees and customers, apology language sends a message about corporate culture. “I” can demonstrate accountability; “we” can affirm inclusion and shared responsibility. Both matter, depending on the situation.</p>\n\n<h2>Leading in a skeptical era</h2>\n\n<p>Corporate apologies are nothing new. But in today’s environment – where social media amplifies every word and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx\">trust in institutions is fragile</a> – the stakes are higher. A single poorly framed statement can trigger outrage, stock sell-offs or viral boycotts. </p>\n\n<p>The good news is that “sorry” doesn’t have to be the hardest word. In fact, this research suggests that a good apology can pay off, literally. The key is to remember that apologies aren’t one-size-fits-all. The right words depend on the nature of the wrongdoing.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266294/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Prachi Gala does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

At the same time, it was hoped that the South Asian nation’s addition might encourage better cross-border cooperation in a region where shared rivers are often fought over.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CUki0hUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">scholar who works on issues of water security</a> and grew up in South Asia, I understand the drivers behind Bangladesh’s decision to join the convention – recent hydro-political events have raised water security risks for the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/bangladesh/\">country of around 174 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But contrary to the intention of the convention, I believe Bangladesh joining could actually heighten tensions in South Asia, <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/ganges-river-treaty-bangladesh-india-climate-change-5258566\">especially with India</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The need for water security</h2>\n\n<p>Bangladesh’s hydro challenges are multifaceted. Half of Bangladeshis live in areas <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75690-w\">that suffer severe drought</a>. Around 60% of the population is <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tackling-flooding-in-Bangladesh-in-a-changing-climate.pdf\">vulnerable to high flood risks</a>. And on average, floods inundate 20% to 25% of the country’s land each year. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/press-releases/230-tons-fecal-waste-end-open-water-bodies-bangladesh-daily-unicef-and-wateraid-call\">more than 65 million residents</a> still lack access to safe and properly managed sanitation facilities. These overlapping vulnerabilities show why water governance is such a key issue for security, diplomacy and development.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the country’s rising population along with the effects of climate change add to this domestic water stress. At least 81 of the 1,415 rivers that flow through Bangladesh have <a href=\"https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/583017c66191\">either perished or are on the brink of extinction</a>, according to a recent report.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Bangladesh relies <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-bangladesh-delta-is-under-a-dangerous-level-of-strain-analysis-reveals-241097#:%7E:text=Bangladesh%20is%20known%20as%20the,well%20as%20booming%20irrigated%20agriculture.\">almost exclusively</a> on rivers that cross borders. With India and China, it shares one of the world’s most complicated transboundary water systems: the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/0b663060-87be-4338-9248-58cb9a2bfd8a/content\">Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basin</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Joining the UN Water Convention</h2>\n\n<p>A number of recent developments underscore the reasons Bangladesh sought greater legal and international protection.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, <a href=\"http://www.mwr.gov.cn/english/News/WaterNews/202507/t20250722_1734790.html\">China announced</a> what is expected to be the world’s largest hydropower dam, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk1251w14o?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=July%2022%2C%202025&amp;utm_source=c1265b6ed7\">the Motuo Hydropower Station</a> in the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwestern China.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6DoRRa626w?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">China starts construction on world’s biggest hydropower project in Tibet • FRANCE 24 English.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The Chinese government is promoting the dam as a clean energy project that will help the area’s economy grow, even though it will cost <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk1251w14o?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=July%2022%2C%202025&amp;utm_source=c1265b6ed7\">1.2 trillion yuan (about US$167 billion)</a> to build. </p>\n\n<p>But countries close by are worried about how the dam will affect the region’s environment and politics. </p>\n\n<p>Both Bangladesh and India <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/by-building-the-worlds-biggest-dam-china-hopes-to-control-more-than-just-its-water-supply-261984\">have complained that</a> the project could make the region less stable. The Yarlung Tsangpo River on which the dam is built runs into India’s Arunachal Pradesh state, which has long been a flashpoint in China-India relations. China <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3310209/china-reasserts-india-border-claims-fresh-list-standard-place-names\">claims the region</a> as its own and calls it Zangnan.</p>\n\n<p>Because of where it is situated, the dam could allow China to control or limit the flow of water into India. Similarly, Bangladesh, a downstream country, is concerned that Chinese upstream intervention could hurt its agriculture and make it harder to get water. </p>\n\n<p>Already, the government of Bangladesh has limited control over the country’s water supply because only about 7% of the watershed area of the Brahmaputra, Meghna and Ganges – the three main rivers that flow into the country – <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/0b663060-87be-4338-9248-58cb9a2bfd8a/content#:%7E:text=Page%204,and%20the%20Congo%20river%20systems\">are within Bangladesh</a>. Moreover, the amount of water that ultimately reaches Bangladesh <a href=\"https://farsightnepal.com/news/chinas-70000-mw-megadam-project-of-the-century-in-brahmaputra/#:%7E:text=Bangladesh%2C%20being%20the%20lowest%20riparian,threat%20to%20its%20water%20security.\">is significantly reduced</a> because dam activities by China and India have limited the flow.</p>\n\n<p>Climate change has made the situation worse by changing the way water flows across the Himalayas and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin. For instance, the Bangladesh delta, one of the most fertile and densely populated areas in the world, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-bangladesh-delta-is-under-a-dangerous-level-of-strain-analysis-reveals-241097\">is already experiencing problems</a>, including salinity intrusion, rising sea levels and the loss of arable land.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, the Bangladesh High Court ruled that the country’s rivers had <a href=\"https://ecojurisprudence.org/initiatives/rights-of-rivers-in-bangladesh/\">the same status as a “legal person</a>” in a bid to award them further protection. This was then followed by a decision by Bangladesh to join the U.N. Water Convention. </p>\n\n<p>Created in 1996, the convention seeks to promote cooperation and sustainable management of shared water resources. At first, it was intended only for European and Central Asian countries. But in 2016, it became available to all U.N. member countries.</p>\n\n<p>Bangladesh had initially delayed signing due to a mix of diplomatic, regional and institutional reasons and out of a concern over how it would affect relations with its powerful neighbor, India.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications for India</h2>\n\n<p>India has traditionally preferred bilateral agreements to resolve cross-border water issues, such as the <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf\">Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan</a> and the <a href=\"https://mowr.nic.in/core/WebsiteUpload/2023/2023011877.pdf\">1996 Ganges water-sharing treaty with Bangladesh</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, India’s bilateral strategy is fraying. The Indus Waters Treaty <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tensions-over-kashmir-and-a-warming-planet-have-placed-the-indus-waters-treaty-on-life-support-244699\">has been temporarily suspended</a> following fighting between Pakistan and India.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"ruR6Q\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ruR6Q/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, New Delhi’s water cooperation with Bangladesh is being tested. The sharing of water from the Teesta, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra, has long been <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/india-must-settle-the-teesta-river-dispute-with-bangladesh-for-lasting-gains/\">a source of conflict</a> between the two countries, with Bangladesh pushing for what it sees as <a href=\"https://www.idsa.in/system/files/page/2015/nts-digest-mar-apr-2023.pdf\">a fairer distribution</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Bangladesh has also opposed Indian dams, such as the <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-bangladesh-trans-boundary-river-management-understanding-the-tipaimukh-dam-controversy-60419#_ednref2\">Tipaimukh on the Barak</a>, over concerns about how they will affect the environment and people’s lives. For similar reasons, Bangladesh has objected to India’s plans <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/the-cost-of-interlinking-indias-rivers/\">to connect 30 rivers</a> as part of a massive irrigation project.</p>\n\n<h2>The ripple effect</h2>\n\n<p>While India’s government has issued no official comment on Bangladesh’s joining the U.N. Water Convention, there are fears in New Delhi that it could <a href=\"https://southasianvoices.org/geo-f-in-n-bangladesh-india-water-diplomacy-08-14-2025/#:%7E:text=Following%20the%20Water%20Convention%20guidelines,India%20to%20accede%20as%20well.\">undermine India’s negotiating power</a> in future water disputes and when the Ganges River Treaty is due for <a href=\"https://mowr.nic.in/core/WebsiteUpload/2023/2023011877.pdf\">renewal in 2026</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The original 1996 agreement sets out that India and Bangladesh would each get a guaranteed share of <a href=\"https://mowr.nic.in/core/WebsiteUpload/2023/2023011877.pdf\">35,000 cubic feet per second of water</a>. The concern in New Delhi is that Bangladesh may ask for more water than originally specified and that being part of the U.N. Water Convention gives the Bangladesh government a more powerful negotiation platform. As such, Bangladesh’s proposition in September 2025 to create <a href=\"https://vietnamnews.vn/world/1724916/bangladesh-seeks-longer-term-ganges-treaty-with-india.html\">a new institutional framework</a> to manage water-sharing agreements with India for 14 transboundary rivers was viewed with suspicion in India.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man stands in a street flooded with water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699497/original/file-20251030-56-d5enjf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Incessant rainfall submerges the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Oct. 1, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/incessant-rainfall-submerges-the-streets-of-dhaka-news-photo/2238127939?initiatedfrom=nlsribbon&amp;adppopup=true\">Maruf Rahman/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Renewing the Ganges River Treaty with a framework that gives Bangladesh more water may put <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56022-6\">more stress on eastern India, an area already experiencing water scarcity</a>, and test India’s <a href=\"https://library.wmo.int/records/item/69629-state-of-global-water-resources-report-2024\">water storage capacity</a>, especially during dry seasons.</p>\n\n<h2>Shifting political currents</h2>\n\n<p>A further concern for India is that Bangladesh signing onto the U.N. Waters Treaty may set a <a href=\"https://southasianvoices.org/geo-f-in-n-bangladesh-india-water-diplomacy-08-14-2025/\">precedent for other countries in the region</a>, such as Nepal and Bhutan.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Bangladesh has mulled the idea of <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zzjg_663340/yzs_663350/xwlb_663352/202506/t20250620_11653906.html\">forming a trilateral hydro-cooperation with China and Pakistan</a> – two of India’s biggest rivals. A day before signing the U.N. convention, Bangladesh joined China and Pakistan in announcing a ‘trilateral cooperation’ on the economy, climate and social development.</p>\n\n<p>For Bangladesh, the potential catastrophe of not tackling cascading environmental challenges justifies the risk of alienating its far more powerful neighbor. But where does this leave India? Ultimately, New Delhi must make a strategic choice: Either stick with bilateralism or adopt new multilateral norms to safeguard its water security and regional power.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264969/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Pintu Kumar Mahla is affiliated with the Water Resources Research Center, the University of Arizona. \n\nHe is also a member of the International Association of Water Law (AIDA). \n\nPintu Kumar Mahla has not received funding related to this article.

I write about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scae030\">history</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2024.1455510\">governance</a> of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-and-harris-are-sharply-divided-on-science-but-share-common-ground-on-us-technology-policy-239053\">American science policy</a>, including the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25613/m4k0-km64\">nation’s investments</a> in research and development.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of broader policy reforms to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/improving-oversight-of-federal-grantmaking/\">federal grantmaking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o\">student</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03417-6\">high-skilled</a> <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/h-1b-fee-hike-by-trump-challenged-in-court\">immigration</a>, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-trumps-gold-standard-politicizes-federal-science-258277\">scientific integrity</a>, this shutdown has both known and unknown consequences for the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5233685\">future of U.S. science</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Funding freezes, data gaps and unpaid workers</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past two decades, the <a href=\"https://mattglassman.substack.com/p/procedural-notes-from-a-shutdown\">story of government shutdowns</a> has become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/shutdown-trump-clinton-gingrich.html\">all too familiar</a>. Shutdowns occur when Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, and, paraphrasing <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/\">Article 1, Section 9</a> of the U.S. Constitution, the government can no longer spend money. </p>\n\n<p>This funding gap affects all but essential government operations, such as the work of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5530753-federal-employees-shutdown-operations\">postal workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers-duffy.html\">air traffic controllers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/who-is-still-working-who-has-been-furloughed-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-07/\">satellite operators</a>. Nonessential employees, including <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses22204/\">tens of thousands</a> of government scientists, are barred from working and stop receiving paychecks.</p>\n\n<p>With scientists and program officers at home, activities at the nearly two dozen federal agencies participating in research and development, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/shutdown/recipients\">National Science Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-26-004.html\">National Institutes of Health</a>, come to a halt. New grant opportunities and review panels <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/federal-science-on-pause-amid-shutdown\">are postponed or canceled</a>, researchers at government laboratories <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03365-1\">stop collecting and analyzing data</a>, and university projects reliant on federal funding <a href=\"https://www.cogr.edu/considerations-federal-government-shutdown\">are put at risk</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Extended shutdowns accelerate the damage. They leave bigger gaps in government data, throw federal employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/us/politics/federal-workers-shutdown-pay.html\">into debt</a> or lead them to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers-duffy.html\">dip into their savings</a>, and force academic institutions <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/financial-health/2025/10/23/fourth-week-federal-shutdown-increasingly-hinders-higher\">to lay off staff</a> paid through government grants and contracts. </p>\n\n<h2>Funding, public services and the rule of law</h2>\n\n<p>Even for shutdowns lasting a few days, it can take science agencies <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/science-agencies-grappling-shutdown-aftermath\">months to catch up</a> on the backlog of paperwork, paychecks and peer review panels before they return to regular operations. </p>\n\n<p>This year, the government faces mounting challenges to overcome once the shutdown ends: Trump and the director of the White House budget office, Russell Vought, are using the shutdown as <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2025/10/why-this-shutdown-is-different-and-what-trump-is-getting-out-of-it\">an opportunity</a> to “<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/russ-vought-wanted-feds-in-trauma-its-happening/\">shutter the bureaucracy</a>” and pressure universities <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5579618/trump-college-university-compact-uva-mit-dartmouth\">to bend</a> to the administration’s ideological positions on topics such as campus speech, gender identity and admission standards.</p>\n\n<p>As the budget standoff nears the record for the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\">longest shutdown ever</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-furloughs.html\">agency furloughs</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dangaristo.bsky.social/post/3m2urrb7ax22r\">reductions in force</a>, <a href=\"https://grant-witness.us/\">canceled grants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/14/us/trump-grants-democrat-districts-government-shutdown.html\">jeopardized infrastructure projects</a> document the devastating and immediate damage to the government’s ability to serve the public.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698812/original/file-20251027-66-op0cst.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"President Trump and Russel Vought stand by a microphone.

Changing appropriated funds directly challenges the power vested in Congress – not the president – to control federal spending. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/shutdown-layoffs-10-000-00609830\">White House’s promise</a> to fire an additional 10,000 civil servants during the shutdown, its threat to <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/the-law-is-the-law-white-house-memo-on-pay-for-furloughed-employees-called-into-question/\">withhold back pay</a> from furloughed workers and its push to end any programs with lapsed funding “<a href=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/OMB-LAPSE-Email-.pdf\">not consistent with the President’s priorities</a>” similarly move to broaden presidential power.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the damage to science could snowball. If Trump and Vought chip enough authority away from Congress by making funding decisions or shuttering statutory agencies, the next three years will see an untold amount of impounded, rescinded or repurposed research funds. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A lab filled with scientific equipment but not staffed.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699005/original/file-20251028-66-nouvdn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The government shutdown has emptied many laboratories staffed by federal scientists.

But nonetheless, U.S. presence in the region will enlarge further in the coming weeks with the arrival of the <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/the-worlds-largest-aircraft-carrier-deploys-to-the-mediterranean-mc-102625\">world’s largest aircraft carrier</a>, the USS Gerald R. Ford.</p>\n\n<p>As a scholar of <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/A+Short+History+of+U.S.+Interventions+in+Latin+America+and+the+Caribbean-p-9781118954010\">U.S.-Latin American relations</a>, I know the actions of the current U.S. administration smack of a long history of interventions in the region. Should escalation develop from attacks on ships into direct military confrontation with Venezuela, such aggression would appear to be <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/shameful-history-us-intervention-latin-america\">par for the course</a> in inter-American relations.</p>\n\n<p>And certainly, governments across Latin America – in and out of Venezuela – will place it in this historical context. </p>\n\n<p>But while it does hearken back to some <a href=\"https://archive.globalpolicy.org/us-westward-expansion/26024-us-interventions.html\">quasi-piratical practices of the U.S. Navy</a>, the military buildup now is in key respects both unprecedented and shocking. It could also damage U.S. relations with the rest of the hemisphere for a generation to come.</p>\n\n<h2>A history of intervention</h2>\n\n<p>In the most obvious way, deploying a flotilla of warships to the southern Caribbean evokes dark echoes of “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/gunboat-diplomacy-how-classic-naval-coercion-has-evolved-into-hybrid-warfare-on-the-water-266741\">gunboat diplomacy</a>” – the unilateral dispatch of marines or soldiers to strong-arm foreign governments that was especially prevalent in Latin America. One <a href=\"https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/united-states-interventions/\">reliable account</a> tallies 41 of these in the region from 1898 to 1994. </p>\n\n<p>Of these, 17 were direct U.S. cases of aggression against sovereign nations and 24 were U.S. forces supporting Latin American dictators or military regimes. Many ended in the overthrow of democratic governments and the deaths of thousands. From 1915 to 1934, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.aaihs.org/reflecting-on-the-u-s-occupation-of-haiti-a-hundred-years-later/\">U.S. invaded and then occupied Haiti</a> and may have killed as many as 11,500 people. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man demonstrates at a rally.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699848/original/file-20251101-56-73mte9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Venezuelan supporter of Maduro takes part in a rally against U.S. military activity in the Caribbean.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/supporter-of-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-wearing-a-news-photo/2243694769?adppopup=true\">Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>During World War II and the Cold War, Washington continued to dictate Latin America’s politics, showing an eagerness to respond to any perceived threat to U.S. investments or markets and backing pro-Washington dictatorships such as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Chile/The-military-dictatorship-from-1973\">Augusto Pinochet’s rule over Chile from 1973 to 1990</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Latin Americans have, by and large, chafed at such naked displays of Washington’s power. This opposition from Latin American governments was the main reason that President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave up interventions with his “<a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/good-neighbor\">Good Neighbor” policy</a> in the 1930s. Intervention continued, though, throughout the Cold War, with moves against leftist governments in Nicaragua and Grenada in the 1980s. </p>\n\n<p>The end of the Cold War did not quite end military interventions. Some U.S. armed forces still operated in the hemisphere, but, since 1994, they had done so as part of multilateral forces, as in Haiti, or responding to invitations or collaborated with host nations, for instance in <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/EnhancedCounterNarcoticsOps/\">anti-narcotics operations</a> in the Andes and Central America. </p>\n\n<p>Showing respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention – both sacred principles in the hemisphere – especially in the context of rising drug violence, has largely <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2025/0904/latin-america-drug-violence\">quieted the resistance to the presence of U.S. troops</a> in the largest nations in the hemisphere, such as Mexico and Brazil. </p>\n\n<h2>No mere Monroe Doctrine reboot</h2>\n\n<p>So is Trump merely reviving a long-abandoned stance on the U.S. role in the region? </p>\n\n<p>Not even close. In two key ways, aggression against Venezuela or any other Latin American country now – rationalized by Washington as a response to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-trafficking-narcotics-colombia-map-2130495\">insufficient law enforcement</a> against drug-running – would be dangerously unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>First, it would blow out of the water the age-old justification for U.S. armed intervention called the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/monroe-doctrine\">Monroe Doctrine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Since 1823, when <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/james-monroe\">President James Monroe</a> announced it, the U.S. has aimed to keep outside powers out of the republics of the hemisphere. </p>\n\n<p>Once a Latin American people won its independence, Washington believed, it had the right to keep it, and the U.S. Navy helped in any way it could.</p>\n\n<p>By the early 20th century, that purported help took on the look of a policeman patrolling the Caribbean Sea on a beat, wielding what then-U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/roosevelt-and-monroe-doctrine\">called a “big stick</a>” and keeping Europeans from landing and, say, collecting debts. Sometimes this was done by having the Marines land first and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/haiti-wall-street-us-banks.html\">move a country’s gold to Wall Street</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An old political cartoon shows a map of people looking at naval vessels.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699843/original/file-20251101-56-6tduhv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 1904 cartoon in the New York Herald shows European leaders observing American naval power under the Monroe Doctrine.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/political-cartoon-from-the-new-york-herald-ca-1904-showing-news-photo/514887736?adppopup=true\">Bettmann/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An expansion of the Panama precedent</h2>\n\n<p>Even during the Cold War, the Monroe Doctrine could be logically invoked to keep the Soviets out of the hemisphere – whether in <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB4/\">Guatemala in 1954</a>, <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/bay-of-pigs\">Cuba in 1961</a>, the <a href=\"https://dsc.duq.edu/dlr/vol4/iss4/4/\">Dominican Republic in 1965</a> or <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/october-25/united-states-invades-grenada\">Grenada in 1983</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Often, as in Guatemala, the Soviet link was weak, even nonexistent. But there was still a thin thread of keeping out a “foreign ideology” that seemed to keep Monroe relevant. </p>\n\n<p>The doctrine died a surer death with the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/december-20/the-u-s-invades-panama\">1989 invasion of Panama</a> to remove its rogue leader, Manuel Noriega, convicted of drug-running and guilty of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/11/opinion/noriega-s-guilt-and-its-aftertaste.html\">trouncing his country’s democracy</a>. No one fingered an extra-hemispheric accomplice.</p>\n\n<p>Noriega’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50837024\">removal by about 26,000 U.S. troops</a> might be the closest parallel to Trump’s targeting of alleged drugs boats in the Caribbean. Trump has already – and repeatedly – alleged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is, like Noriega, not the head of state of his own country and therefore indictable. More fantastically, he has alleged that the Venezuelan leader <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html\">is the head of the Tren de Aragua</a> gang that has been designated a “foreign terrorist organization” by U.S. authorities. It is not too big a leap from there to calling for – and participating in – the overthrow of Maduro on the grounds of removing an international “<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">narco-terrorist</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>But even there, the parallel with Panama diverges in a crucial way: A U.S. attack on Venezuela would be far different in scale and geography. Maduro’s country is 12 times larger, with about six times the population. Its active troops number <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-venezuela-fend-off-a-us-invasion-its-military-and-weapons-explained-13944455.html\">at least 100,000</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A photo of a bombed out vehicle.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=392&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=392&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=392&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=493&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=493&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699844/original/file-20251101-56-f509gz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=493&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A 1989 photo of the bombed out Panamanian Defense Forces Headquarters after being destroyed in the American invasion of Panama.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/PanamaNoriega/e5098db6fac8449092a74881938e8f7c/photo\">AP Photo/Matias Recar</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Another Iraq?</h2>\n\n<p>In all of the U.S. invasions and occupations of Latin America, none has occurred in South America or in a large country. </p>\n\n<p>To be sure, troops from “<a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/hahr/article/47/4/502/158189/Anti-Americanism-in-Mexico-1910-1913\">the colossus of the north</a>” invaded Mexico several times, beginning in 1846, but never did they hold the entire country. In the Mexican War, U.S. troops soon <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/us-military-actions-and-wars-1775-1994/\">retreated after 1848</a>. In 1914, they <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-occupation-of-Veracruz\">occupied a single city</a>, Veracruz, and in 1916, they chased around a bandit in <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1997/fall/mexican-punitive-expedition-1.html\">the Punitive Expedition</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In all these episodes, it found taking parts of Mexico expensive and unproductive.</p>\n\n<p>And a U.S.-provoked regime change in a sovereign country today, such as in Venezuela, would likely trigger a massive resistance not only from its military but throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>Maduro’s threat of a “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maduro-venezuela-us-troops-caribbean\">republic in arms</a>” should the U.S. invade might be bluster. But it might not. Many experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/us-military-venezuela-strike-guerrilla-war\">predict that such an invasion</a> would meet with disaster. Maduro <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/31/russia-venezuela-oil-trump/\">has already asked for military assistance</a> from Russia, China and even Iran. Even without such help, the mobilization of U.S. assets in the Caribbean is no guarantee of success. </p>\n\n<p>And while many governments in the rest of the hemisphere would no doubt love to see Maduro gone, they would dislike more the method of his going. The presidents of Colombia and Mexico <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/10/gringos-go-home-latin-america-reacts-to-trumps-expanding-military-campaign/\">have criticized the attacks</a>, and others have warned of the resentment in the hemisphere were an intervention to follow. </p>\n\n<p>In part, this is informed by the U.S. interventionist past in Latin America, but it also comes from a place of self-preservation, particularly among the left-leaning governments who have already drawn Trump’s ire. As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/24/trump-asia-tariffs-shutdown-immigration/91b2be0c-b0d5-11f0-ab72-a5fffa9bf3eb_story.html\">President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil said</a>, “If this becomes a trend, if each one thinks they can invade another’s territory to do whatever they want, where is the respect for the sovereignty of nations?” </p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is, contrary to the White House’s statements, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-each-boat-strike-off-venezuelas-coast-saves-25000-lives\">not much of a producer or trans-shipment point</a> of narcotics. What if Trump turned his sights on other government even more compromised by drug corruption, such as Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru?</p>\n\n<p>The concern there will be over becoming the next domino in line.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268845/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alan McPherson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

A year from now, Americans in every state and district will get to vote for whom they want representing their interests in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>But right now, Congress isn’t giving the American people much to go on. </p>\n\n<p>As the shutdown of the federal government passes the one-month mark, the U.S. House of Representatives has been in recess for over 40 days. That’s <a href=\"https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/the-house-is-on-an-unprecedented\">the longest it’s ever stayed out of town</a> outside of its typical summer recesses or the weeks leading up to their own elections.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the shutdown does not mean that Congress can’t meet. In fact, it must meet to end the shutdown legislatively. The Senate, for example, has taken votes recently on <a href=\"https://www.alreporter.com/2025/10/29/u-s-senate-confirms-bill-lewis-to-serve-as-alabama-federal-judge/\">judicial nominations</a>, a <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/10/senate-passes-its-version-of-2026-ndaa-amid-government-shutdown/\">major defense authorization bill</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/nx-s1-5591301/senate-trump-tariffs\">resolution on tariff policy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Senators have also continued to hold <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/30/congress/katie-britt-chuck-schumer-shutdown-chat-00630206\">bipartisan behind-the-scenes negotiations</a> to end the shutdown impasse.</p>\n\n<p>But with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/snap-food-aid-ruling-shutdown-trump-09f9807264385f0beab61a68dcbbdd66\">dwindling SNAP benefits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/obamacare-premiums-increase-2026-coverage\">skyrocketing health care premiums</a> and other major shutdown impacts beginning to set in, the House has all but abdicated its position as “The People’s Chamber.”</p>\n\n<h2>Long ‘path to irrelevance’</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to not meeting for any votes, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has <a href=\"https://azmirror.com/briefs/johnson-sets-record-refusing-to-swear-in-adelita-grijalva-for-36-days-after-she-won-election/\">refused to swear in</a> Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Despite <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/adelita-grijalva-lawsuit-sworn-in-house\">Johnson’s assurances</a>, the shutdown does not prevent the House from meeting in a brief session to swear in Grijalva as a member for Arizona’s 7th District, which has been without representation since March.</p>\n\n<p>Along with <a href=\"https://www.caseyburgat.com/\">Casey Burgat</a> and <a href=\"https://sorellewg.com/\">SoRelle Wyckoff Gaynor</a>, I am co-author of a textbook, “<a href=\"https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/congress-explained-2-290898\">Congress Explained: Representation and Lawmaking in the First Branch</a>.” In that book, it was important to us to highlight Congress’ clear role as the preeminent lawmaking body in the federal government. </p>\n\n<p>But throughout the shutdown battle, Congress – particularly the House of Representatives – has been unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. Beyond policymaking, Congress has been content to hand over many of its core constitutional powers to the executive branch. As a <a href=\"https://www.charlesrhunt.com/\">Congress expert</a> who loves the institution and profoundly respects its constitutionally mandated role, I have found this renunciation of responsibility difficult to watch.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, Congress’ path to irrelevance as a body of government did not begin during the shutdown, or even in January 2025. </p>\n\n<p>It is the result of decades of erosion that created a political culture in which Congress, the first branch of government listed in the Constitution, is relegated to second-class status.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man in a suit with a blue tie, holding a folder with a white document in it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/667986/original/file-20250514-56-gmw520.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump holds one of the many executive orders he has signed during his second term.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-donald-trump-speaks-to-the-media-while-signing-news-photo/2213049268?adppopup=true\">Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The Constitution puts Congress first</h2>\n\n<p>The 18th-century framers of the Constitution viewed Congress as the foundation of republican governance, deliberately <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvmd856f\">placing it first in Article 1</a> to underscore its primacy. Congress was assigned the pivotal tasks of lawmaking and budgeting because controlling government finances was seen as essential to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-claims-of-vast-presidential-powers-run-up-against-article-2-of-the-constitution-and-exceed-previous-presidents-power-grabs-249662\">limiting executive power and preventing abuses</a> that the framers associated with monarchy. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, a weak legislature and an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.17468\">imperial executive</a> were precisely what many of the founders feared. With legislative authority in the hands of Congress, power would at least be decentralized among a wide variety of elected leaders from different parts of the country, each of whom would jealously guard <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp\">their own local interests</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But Trump’s first 100 days turned the founders’ original vision on its head, leaving the “first branch” to play second fiddle. </p>\n\n<p>Like most recent presidents, Trump came in with his party in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate. Yet despite the lawmaking power that this <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-agenda-will-face-hurdles-in-congress-despite-the-republican-trifecta-of-winning-the-house-senate-and-white-house-243550\">governing trifecta</a> can bring, the Republican majorities in Congress have mostly been irrelevant to Trump’s agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Congress has <a href=\"https://time.com/7281249/congress-trump-100-days/\">relied on Trump</a> and the executive branch to make changes to federal policy and in many cases to reshape the federal government completely. </p>\n\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025\">has signed more than 210 executive orders</a>, a pace faster than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Republican Congress has shown little interest in pushing back on any of them. Trump has also aggressively reorganized, defunded or <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elon-musk-calls-for-the-u-s-to-delete-entire-agencies-from-federal-government\">simply deleted</a> entire agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\n\n<p>These actions have been carried out even though Congress has a clear constitutional authority over the executive branch’s budget. And during the shutdown, Congress has shown little to no interest in reasserting its “<a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Power-of-the-Purse/\">power of the purse</a>,” content instead to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/congress-not-the-president-decides-on-government-spending-a-constitutional-law-professor-explains-how-the-power-of-the-purse-works-248644\">let the president decide</a> which individuals and agencies receive funding, regardless of what Congress has prescribed.</p>\n\n<h2>Many causes, no easy solutions</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no one culprit but instead a collection of factors that have provided the ineffectual Congress of today.</p>\n\n<p>One overriding factor is a process that has unfolded over the past 50 or more years <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/01/1132933077/voters-everywhere-are-talking-about-the-same-issues-heres-why-that-matters\">called political nationalization</a>. American politics have become increasingly centered on national issues, parties and figures rather than more local concerns or individuals. </p>\n\n<p>This shift has elevated the importance of the president as the symbolic and practical leader of a national party agenda. Simultaneously, it weakens the role of individual members of Congress, who are now more likely to toe the party line than represent local interests. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A brown-haired woman in a red jacket stands at a microphone in front of three American flags, speaking.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699747/original/file-20251031-56-xjtz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who won a special election on Sept. 23, 2025, has not been sworn in by House Speaker Mike Johnson.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rep-elect-adelita-grijalva-d-ariz-speaks-as-house-minority-news-photo/2242061229?adppopup=true\">Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As a result, voters focus more on presidential elections and less on congressional ones, granting the president greater influence and diminishing Congress’ independent authority.</p>\n\n<p>The more Congress polarizes among its members on a party-line basis, the less the public is likely to trust the legitimacy of its opposition to a president. Instead, congressional pushback − sometimes <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-trial-02-13-2021\">as extreme as impeachment</a> − can thus be written off not as principled or substantive but as partisan or politically motivated to a greater extent than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>Congress has also been complicit in giving away its own power. Especially when dealing with a polarized Congress, presidents increasingly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-unveils-federal-budget-blueprint-2025-05-02/\">steer the ship</a> in budget negotiations, which can lead to more local priorities – the ones Congress is supposed to represent – being ignored. </p>\n\n<p>But rather than Congress staking out positions for itself, as it often did through the turn of the 21st century, political science research has shown that presidential positions on domestic policy <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo8158910.html\">increasingly dictate – and polarize</a> – Congress’ own positions on policy that hasn’t traditionally been divisive, such as funding support for NASA. Congress’ positions on procedural issues, such as raising the debt ceiling or eliminating the filibuster, also increasingly depend not on bedrock principles but <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo8158910.html\">on who occupies the White House</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the realm of foreign policy, Congress has <a href=\"https://www.legbranch.org/the-precarious-state-of-war-powers/\">all but abandoned</a> its constitutional power to declare war, settling instead for “authorizations” of military force that the president wants to assert. These give the commander in chief wide latitude over war powers, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have been happy to retain that power. They have used these congressional approvals to <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/hjres77/text\">engage in extended conflicts such as the Gulf War</a> in the early 1990s and the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/114/text\">wars in Iraq and Afghanistan</a> a decade later.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s lost with a weak Congress</h2>\n\n<p>Americans lose a lot when Congress hands over such drastic power to the executive branch. </p>\n\n<p>When individual members of Congress from across the country take a back seat, their districts’ distinctly local problems are less likely to be addressed with the power and resources that Congress can bring to an issue. Important local perspectives on national issues fail to be represented in Congress. </p>\n\n<p>Even members of the same political party represent districts with vastly different economies, demographics and geography. Members are supposed to keep this in mind when legislating on these issues, but presidential control over the process makes that difficult or even impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe more importantly, a weak Congress paired with what historian Arthur Schlesinger called the “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Imperial_Presidency/ZkxlY4S2iWYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Imperial Presidency</a>” is a recipe for an unaccountable president, running wild without the constitutionally provided oversight and checks on power that the founders provided to the people through their representation by the first branch of government.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is an updated version of a story that first published on May 15, 2025.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268536/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Charlie Hunt does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The figure was La Santa Muerte – or Holy Death – a female folk saint cloaked in mystery and controversy that had previously been known, if at all, as a figure of domestic devotion: someone they might address a prayer to, but in the privacy of their home.</p>\n\n<p>She personifies death itself and is often depicted holding a scythe or globe. And since the early 2000s, her popularity has <a href=\"https://skeletonsaint.com/2019/10/07/why-would-a-belgian-follow-mexican-folk-saint-santa-muerte/\">steadily spread across</a> <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/santa-muerte-worship-continues-spreading-beyond-mexico/%22%22\">Mexico and the Americas</a>, Europe and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>The idea and image of death made into a saint is both unthinkable and magnetic. Her <a href=\"https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/santa-muerte-inspired-and-ritualistic-killings\">association with drug traffickers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/3/31/arrests-in-mexico-over-saint-death-killings\">criminal rituals</a> makes many people wary of the skeletal figure. La Santa Muerte also faces significant <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22462181\">opposition from the Catholic Church</a>, which condemns her veneration as heretical and morally dangerous. High-ranking church figures <a href=\"https://religiondispatches.org/mexicos-war-on-saint-death/\">such as Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera</a> in Mexico have publicly denounced her devotion, warning that it promotes superstition and goes against Christian values. </p>\n\n<p>This criticism highlights a profound tension between official religion and the grassroots devotion. Many Mexicans who feel abandoned by government and church institutions embrace her as a source of hope. Indeed, based on my research, La Santa Muerte represents strength, protection and comfort to her devotees, which include prisoners, police officers, sex workers, LGBTQ+ people, migrants, the working class and others among less vulnerable populations. Despite her fearsome appearance, she offers a form of care they are often denied elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://anthropology.fas.harvard.edu/people/myriam-lamrani\">As an anthropologist</a> who has studied La Santa Muerte in Mexico, I believe her power reflects a paradoxical Mexican understanding of death – not only as a symbol of fear but as an intimate part of everyday life that has become one of resilience and resistance amid the country’s chronic violence. </p>\n\n<h2>Death and the state</h2>\n\n<p>In my recent book, “<a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/9781477330029/\">The Intimacy of Images</a>,” I examine how devotion to La Santa Muerte in Oaxaca – the state famed for its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/day-of-the-dead-is-taking-on-halloween-traditions-but-the-sacred-holiday-is-far-more-than-a-mexican-halloween-212686\">Day of the Dead tradition</a> – draws on Mexico’s long-standing, often playful relationship with the image of death. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A person holding a picture of a religious icon.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699213/original/file-20251029-102-9qbuz2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A person holds a picture during a visit to the Santa Muerte temple in Tepito, Mexico City, on April 1, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/person-holds-a-picture-during-a-visit-to-the-santa-muerte-news-photo/2207514519?adppopup=true\">Gerardo Vieyra/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Based on over a decade of ethnographic fieldwork, I found how people’s prayers, offerings and promises to her are part of a desire for solutions to everyday problems such as illness, economic hardship and protection from harm. Her frequent representation in images such as altars, tattoos and artistic productions also reflects an evolving social understanding of death that has long been a pervasive symbol of <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9781890951542/death-and-the-idea-of-mexico?srsltid=AfmBOopVrkMKi32sj6d7p2ozDAJFT0S19x-lHJ-SiIrE5mG4xN78lfK9\">Mexican culture, identity and the power of the state</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century, death as a symbol of the new Mexican nation was popularized by artists such as José Guadalupe Posada, especially through <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-la-catrina-became-the-iconic-symbol-of-day-of-the-dead-212687\">La Catrina</a>, the caricature of the dandy skeleton often associated with the Day of the Dead. Whereas death and its personification were once part of an ethos of celebration and fearlessness in the face of death, they have now become disturbing reminders of the mounting insecurity and violence in Mexico. </p>\n\n<p>This transformation, and the role the skeletal saint plays in providing protection in this dangerous context, reflects Mexico’s broader descent into turmoil. In the 2000 national elections, the Institutional Revolutionary Party was unseated after 71 years of uninterrupted rule. The election of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, in its place saw the fracturing of <a href=\"https://www.fairobserver.com/region/latin_america/drug-war-strategy-pri/\">informal alliances</a> between the state and criminal networks that had previously tamped down on crime through systems of patronage. </p>\n\n<p>In 2006, newly elected PAN President Felipe Calderón launched a <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/mexican-drug-war-2006-2012\">militarized war</a> on crime after the yearslong evolution of these early criminal networks into ruthless organizations. </p>\n\n<p>In the following decades, cartel violence has surged, <a href=\"https://www.visionofhumanity.org/violence-against-women-in-mexico/\">civilian deaths and femicides</a> have escalated, and state institutions have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129001666/data-leak-exposes-mexico-military-corruption-including-collusion-with-drug-carte\">accused of either direct complicity</a> or a refusal to intervene. The 2014 disappearance of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93py3qzpnyo\">43 students</a> in Iguala – a case that revealed the degree of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/mexico-drug-war-43-students-ayotzinapa\">state and criminal organizations’ collusion</a> and remains unresolved – only crystallized public outrage. Such <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/19/mexico-investigate-apparent-mass-killing-site\">rampant violence continues</a> to this day.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beginning of the Mexican drug war in 2006, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/mexicos-long-war-drugs-crime-and-cartels\">460,000</a> people have been murdered, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/mexico\">more than 115,000 people are officially listed</a> as missing in the country – roughly one in every 1,140 residents. In heavily affected states such as Guerrero and Jalisco, that ratio is likely far higher, revealing the uneven geography of violence and disappearance across the country. </p>\n\n<p>Claudia Sheinbaum, the country’s first female president – who took office in October 2024 – has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanielparishflannery/2025/03/24/can-president-sheinbaum-defeat-mexicos-drug-cartels/\">promised to dismantle</a> organized crime.

Instead, she is one of the few remaining forms of help amid a terrifying social reality. She offers no illusion that the situation of political dysfunction or rampant violence will improve – only presence and protection. Her image reflects a brutal truth: Survival is no longer guaranteed by a state whose <a href=\"https://peacepalacelibrary.nl/blog/2016/mexico-and-drug-cartels-history-fascination\">ties to the cartels run deep</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This political and spiritual vacuum is seen in the rise of other lay figures of devotion – folk saints such as <a href=\"https://www.laits.utexas.edu/jaime/jnicolopulos/cwp3/ncg/jesus_malverde.htm\">Jesús Malverde</a>,  more official ones such as <a href=\"https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=127\">San Judas Tadeo</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gaudiumpress.ca/construction-of-a-satanic-temple-in-mexico-raises-outrage-shock/\">even devotion to the devil</a>. </p>\n\n<p>La Santa Muerte is distinct, however. She is death personified, the end of life, the ultimate judge and a symbol of shared mortality, regardless of status, race or gender. As one devotee told me: “<a href=\"https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.13075\">If you open us, you’ll find the same bones</a>.” La Santa Muerte is also imbued with care and love by her followers. Some address her as kin, an aunt or a revered mother incarnating maternal protection and a kind of strength more commonly associated with the masculine. As many say: “She’s a badass.” </p>\n\n<p>In a country where state protection is scarce and the boundaries between authorities and cartels blur, she represents the people and also shields her believers through miraculous protection. Her followers turn to her because, as they say, only death can protect them from death. </p>\n\n<p>Given her devotees’ vulnerability and the wholehearted trust they place in their skeletal saint, La Santa Muerte is more than mere folklore. She is the patron saint of the many in a country where death walks close. She is a figure of personal solace and collective resilience. Above all, she is a mirror – reflecting a society in crisis and engulfed in violence, and a people reaching for meaning, dignity and protection in the face of it all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263885/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Myriam Lamrani does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In a country that valorizes creativity yet neglects the people who produce it, I’ve seen how artists are left to navigate a system that treats their calling as a personal gamble rather than a profession worth supporting. </p>\n\n<p>“I wish this country supported artists,” one artist told me. “Look how good it could be if culture was celebrated.”</p>\n\n<p>The reality is that for many artists, the dream of sustaining a creative career now comes with steep odds: volatile income, limited benefits and few protections against technological or market shocks. </p>\n\n<p>Some countries have begun to recognize this and act accordingly. South Korea, for instance, introduced its <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/creativity/en/policy-monitoring-platform/enactment-act-protection-status-and-rights-artists-and-relevant-system#:%7E:text=Description%20of%20the%20policy/measure,ecosystem%20for%20the%20cultural%20industry'.\">Artist Welfare Act</a> in 2011 and expanded it in 2022, creating mechanisms for income stabilization, insurance coverage and protection against unfair contracts. </p>\n\n<p>Such examples show that insecurity is not an inevitable feature of artistic life – it’s a symptom of policy choices. </p>\n\n<p>My new book, “<a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/artists-work\">Artists at Work: Rethinking Policy for Artistic Careers</a>,” uses U.S. labor force data to show how building a creative career has become an increasingly risky pursuit – and how smarter policies could make it less so.</p>\n\n<h2>A fragile profession</h2>\n\n<p>About 2.4 million Americans are artists, or roughly 1% of the workforce in 2019. This figure includes individuals whose primary occupation falls within an artistic field – such as musicians, designers, writers, actors, architects or visual artists – according to the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appILLPDg5BYkFDCA/shrwplMUiQBCvJYNY/tblbZEKaiLlMuBa2d/viwek7pc74uUBzcFQ/recNmjSE92TVwy5hR/fld3t6BOdOd6fRKYm/att5UUq9jOXjLkFzP\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. It’s likely an undercount, since many artists hold jobs outside of the arts to support their creative work.</p>\n\n<p>But even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of working artists was already falling. Between 2017 and 2019, <a href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sites/nadac/infographics-current-population-survey-cps-artists-employment-2016-2020-trends\">formal employment in these fields dropped</a> from 2.48 million to 2.4 million, a quiet contraction that reflected shrinking opportunities and growing instability across creative fields.</p>\n\n<p>When COVID-19 hit, that slow decline <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/news/press-releases/2022/new-data-show-economic-impact-covid-19-arts-culture-sector\">turned into a collapse</a>. The arts economy shrank by 6.4% in 2020 – nearly twice the overall U.S. rate of decline – and more than 600,000 jobs disappeared. For artists, the pandemic didn’t create new problems so much as reveal how little of the safety net reached them in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Health insurance is one example.</p>\n\n<p>Most artists are insured, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10824-019-09352-5\">but roughly 20% buy coverage on their own</a>, compared with about <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-284.html\">10% of all U.S. workers</a>. When the Affordable Care Act expanded access to individual plans, artists’ coverage rates <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10824-019-09352-5\">improved significantly</a> – a reminder that good policy can make a real difference for this workforce. </p>\n\n<p>Even this modest progress is now under threat: With enhanced marketplace subsidies set to expire and the current government funding impasse looming, individual premiums under the ACA could <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">more than double</a> for many enrollees next year.</p>\n\n<p>Education doesn’t provide much protection either. Artists are among the most educated groups in the labor market – about two-thirds hold at least a bachelor’s degree – but their earnings don’t rise as much with each level of education as those of other professionals. Research shows that even artists with graduate degrees <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642231177659\">earn lower pay and face sharper income swings</a> than workers with similar schooling in other fields.</p>\n\n<p>Artists almost by definition juggle multiple roles. In 2019, about 8% held more than one job – compared with 5% of all workers – and roughly 30% worked part time in different types of jobs. Many combined teaching, freelance projects and contract gigs to piece together something close to full-time work.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A dark hallway in a hospital with a young woman mopping the floor.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=396&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698498/original/file-20251025-56-bfuko0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A freelance artist who works as a custodian by night cleans the bathrooms at a Maryland hospital in 2016.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brianai-mercedes-weidner-cleans-the-bathrooms-at-the-cecil-news-photo/516468594?adppopup=true\">Astrid Riecken/The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>My research shows that self-employment <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1042258717728067\">is far more common among artists</a> than among other workers. Yet many go independent not because they crave entrepreneurship but because it’s the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10824-022-09464-5\">only option available</a>. The top industries employing artists include professional and technical services, arts and entertainment, information and retail. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, artists often move between arts and non-arts jobs, teaching by day or working service shifts at night, just to keep their creative practice alive.</p>\n\n<h2>Existing labor laws assume a steady paycheck</h2>\n\n<p>Most U.S. labor protections – health insurance, paid leave, workers’ compensation and retirement benefits – <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/resource-library/understanding-employee-protections-issue-brief\">are tied to full-time, W-2 employment</a>. But few artists work that way. They rely on gigs that don’t fit neatly into existing systems: short-term contracts, productions with limited runs such as musicals or film shoots, and one-off project fees.</p>\n\n<p>Existing rules simply do not support professional artists.</p>\n\n<p>Because employers don’t pay into unemployment funds for contractors or freelancers, most artists are ineligible for unemployment insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Copyright law was originally written with publishers and record labels in mind, <a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ndjicl7&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page=\">leaving visual artists without royalties</a> when their work is resold. Existing copyright law <a href=\"https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively/\">is being challenged</a> by artists and record labels, who are claiming their work was used to train AI models without permission, favoring tech companies that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/09/democratized-creativity-the-evolution-and-impact-of-ai/\">say these tools will “democratize” artmaking</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The tax code, meanwhile, lets collectors deduct the full value of artwork they donate, but <a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bulr60&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page=\">limits artists</a> themselves to deducting only the cost of materials. </p>\n\n<p>Public funding of the arts, from the New Deal’s <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/WPA-Federal-Art-Project\">Federal Art Project</a> to the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/nea-history-1965-2008.pdf\">National Endowment for the Arts</a>, has come in brief bursts – but is often first on the chopping block during economic downturns.</p>\n\n<p>Together, these examples reveal a century-long pattern: The U.S. celebrates art but neglects artists. Instead of treating creative work as legitimate labor, the country’s policies fail to offer artists stability or protection.</p>\n\n<h2>Labor policy that values artists</h2>\n\n<p>If labor policies have largely ignored artists, it’s because policymakers start from the wrong place. Too often, artists are <a href=\"https://wallacefoundation.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/Gifts-of-the-Muse.pdf\">asked to justify their worth</a> by proving that they drive tourism, raise property values or fuel innovation. That logic turns creative work into a tool for someone else’s goals.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, a better starting point is the right to choose creative work. <a href=\"https://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/solguide/VUS06/essay06c.html\">The ability to select one’s occupation freely</a> – and to make a living doing meaningful work – is, to many Americans, as fundamental as freedom of speech. Yet the structure of U.S. workforce policy makes that choice nearly impossible for many artists.</p>\n\n<p>A more coherent approach would treat the arts as part of the nation’s labor system, not an afterthought. One policy change could require benefits such as health care, unemployment insurance and retirement savings to be portable – <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2017/02/23/portable-benefits-insecure-workforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">following the worker, not the employer</a>. Laws could protect freelancers from late or missing payments, such as New York’s <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/freelance-isnt-free-act.page\">Freelance Isn’t Free Act</a>. And tax and copyright policies could give artists the same chance to profit from their work that investors and corporations already enjoy. Many European countries already do this through “<a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/legislation/details/5937\">droit de suite</a>” laws, which grant visual artists a small royalty each time their work is resold – ensuring that creators, not just collectors, can reap the rewards of the long-term value of their art.</p>\n\n<p>Designing policies around how many artists actually work – project by project, contract by contract – would make it possible for more people to build sustainable careers in the arts. It would also make the sector more inclusive, drawing talent from across social classes rather than only from those that can afford to take the risk.</p>\n\n<p>But I think policy change also requires a shift in mindset. </p>\n\n<p>Viewing artists not as special cases or economic tools, but as workers exercising a basic human right – the right to choose their work – strengthens both culture and democracy. To me, the central question is not whether artists deserve help because their work enriches others, but whether every individual should have the freedom to make a living through work that gives life meaning.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266138/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanna Woronkowicz does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That country has an area about <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=area+of+montana+vs+area+of+italy\">80% of the size of Montana</a> and is home to less prey, less open land and <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=population+of+montana+vs+population+of+italy\">more than 50 times as many people</a>, all of which significantly raise the potential for human-wolf conflict.</p>\n\n<p>So far in Idaho and Montana, gray wolf numbers have <a href=\"https://fwp.mt.gov/binaries/content/assets/fwp/conservation/wolf/12---2023-06-01-wolf-forecasting-model.pdf\">stopped increasing</a> and may still satisfy <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/04/02/E9-5991/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-final-rule-to-identify-the-northern-rocky-mountain\">requirements under federal laws protecting</a> the species. But the wolf population there is not robust and thriving – it’s just surviving.</p>\n\n<p>Wolves remain absent from <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/08/2023-24514/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-establishment-of-a-nonessential-experimental\">large areas that provide suitable habitat</a> for them. Reducing wolf numbers further, as the states want to do, would limit their ability to reoccupy these areas, where they could restore ecosystems by helping to manage often overabundant prey populations and also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.413\">inspire millions of people</a> with their wildness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Grizzly bears: Viable yet vulnerable</h2>\n\n<p>Grizzly bear populations in the Greater Yellowstone and northern Continental Divide ecosystems have <a href=\"https://flatheadbeacon.com/2025/08/20/fwp-director-says-montana-is-ready-to-delist-the-grizzly-during-panel-discussion-at-western-caucus-policy-summit/\">exceeded the federal recovery targets</a> set <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/species/grizzly-bear-ursus-arctos-horribilis\">decades ago under the Endangered Species Act to prevent the bears’ extinction</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2025, a U.S. House of Representatives committee agreed to <a href=\"https://dailymontanan.com/2025/07/17/house-committee-signs-off-on-delisting-grizzly-bear/\">remove the species’ protection</a> under the law, which would allow <a href=\"https://flatheadbeacon.com/2025/08/20/fwp-director-says-montana-is-ready-to-delist-the-grizzly-during-panel-discussion-at-western-caucus-policy-summit/\">states to permit people to hunt the bears</a> for the first time in decades. But it was overhunting that, in part, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.70057\">drove them to near extinction</a> in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>Government agencies often say that hunting and trapping reduce human conflicts with bears. But scientific and public opinion on that point is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.70057\">far from a consensus</a>. There are <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27316734\">effective, nonlethal methods for keeping bears away from humans</a>, such as public education, electric fencing, bear-resistant garbage containers and removal of roadkill and dead livestock.</p>\n\n<p>Once numbering more than <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/species/grizzly-bear-ursus-arctos-horribilis\">50,000 across at least 18 states</a> in the 48 contiguous United States, grizzlies now number <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/species/grizzly-bear-ursus-arctos-horribilis\">just over 2,000 and occupy less than 5% of their original habitat area</a>. They can be found in only four states.</p>\n\n<p>Current grizzly populations are also not interconnected, despite the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110199\">availability of suitable habitat</a> for them. That risks <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110199\">genetic isolation</a> of subpopulations, which decreases genetic diversity and their prospects for adaptation and survival. Disconnection of populations also reduces their ability to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80440-9\">disperse seeds</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079%5B2219:GBDEOS%5D2.0.CO;2\">improve soil health</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2025.111455\">prey on other species</a>. Grizzly bears are also an umbrella species, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109888\">meaning they share habitat with a disproportionate number of other species</a>, so recovering grizzlies benefits the entire food web. </p>\n\n<p>One day, hunting might offer a new way for humans to reconnect with thriving grizzlies. But right now, with populations isolated and vulnerable, opening a hunting season would risk cutting off their chance to thrive in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110199\">large, unoccupied ranges</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of very large animals stand in a grassy area surrounded by tree trunks.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/689002/original/file-20250903-56-q9eyjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Bison are common in Yellowstone National Park – but not nearly as common as they once were.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/herd-of-bison-graze-in-the-area-of-an-old-wildfire-in-news-photo/1318800227\">Jon G.

Today, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/2201473X.2019.1677134\">most bison live on ranches</a> in small, fenced herds. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bison/protecting-bison.htm\">Only 31,000 bison</a> in North America are managed for conservation, and most are in isolated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205315120\">pockets of habitat at the fringe of their historic range</a>. Even in Yellowstone National Park, which supports thousands of bison and provides a glimpse into how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu0703\">bison historically shaped North American ecosystems</a>, the animals are barred from expanding to other parts of their historic range due to <a href=\"https://greateryellowstone.org/blog/2025/montana-files-lawsuit-against-yellowstone-national-park-over-new-bison-management-plan\">concerns about disease transfer</a> to domestic livestock. </p>\n\n<p>Thinking about the bison’s recovery in different terms does not mean tens of millions of them need to be stampeding across the continent. But it could mean <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1523-1739.2008.00899.x\">large, free-ranging, genetically diverse herds</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/08/ecological-benefits-far-ranging-bison-herds\">integrated into a variety of ecosystems</a>, where they also have a role in cultural revitalization. </p>\n\n<p>A thriving view of species recovery is central to Indigenous-led initiatives, such as those guided by the <a href=\"https://www.buffalotreaty.com/\">2014 Buffalo Treaty</a>, which has been signed by <a href=\"https://www.buffalotreaty.com/articles-of-the-buffalo-treaty\">more than 40 Indigenous nations</a>. The treaty helped drive bison reintroduction to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/conservation-science/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2023.1305932/full\">Banff National Park</a> in Canada and is currently inspiring the recovery of free-roaming bison on Indigenous reservations across the U.S. and Canada, including the <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/blackfoot-guardians-buffalo-herds/\">Blackfeet Reservation in Montana</a> and <a href=\"https://windriverbuffalo.org/\">Wind River Reservation in Wyoming</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A broader vision of recovery</h2>\n\n<p>Shifting away from the long-standing goal of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511623400\">minimum viable population</a> would require changes to how recovery targets are set, how success is measured, and how decisions are made when populations reach those minimum thresholds. </p>\n\n<p>While national laws in the U.S. and Canada provide valuable starting points, focusing on species not just surviving but thriving would involve more ambitious goals, longer timelines and stronger human-wildlife coexistence measures. It would also require shifting public expectations away from the idea that recovery ends when minimal legal obligations are met.</p>\n\n<p>Doing so could help combat climate change by restoring the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.01.041\">role of large, wild animals in nutrient cycling</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1205106\">reverse ecosystem degradation</a> and help people of all backgrounds <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24706957\">reconnect with nature</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As wildlife biologists, we aim to provide the best available science and recommendations to inform the conservation of North America’s wildlife. Yet under the current management paradigm, where recovery often equates to mere survival, we are compelled to ask whether this is enough. Should wildlife conservation aim merely to prevent extinction or to foster populations that thrive? How each and every one of us answers this question will shape not only the future of wolves, grizzly bears and bison, but also the legacy of wildlife recovery across North America.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263898/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mark Hebblewhite receives funding from National Science Foundation. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Benjamin Larue and Jonathan Farr do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The solution was <a href=\"https://digilab.libs.uga.edu/cemetery/exhibits/show/history/rural\">rural cemeteries</a> outside the city limits.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white image of a cemetery on a hill, with a tower atop the hill and trees scattered throughout.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=762&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=762&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=762&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=958&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=958&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699552/original/file-20251030-56-hb1g7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=958&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Mass., between 1890 and 1901.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/glimpse-of-the-tower-mt-auburn-cemetery-cambridge-mass-news-photo/1510999908?adppopup=true\">Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mountauburn.org/history/\">Mount Auburn, the first rural cemetery</a>, was opened in 1831 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in conjunction with the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. The developers kept the natural state in mind and <a href=\"https://uscpress.com/Grave-Landscapes\">drew inspiration from</a> English landscape gardens and from a large cemetery in Paris: <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Pere-Lachaise-Cemetery\">Père Lachaise</a> – Napoleon’s solution for running out of space for burials in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Early rural cemeteries were closely linked with horticulture societies, and they became popular green spaces to visit to escape the pollution and crowds of the cities. The founder of one early rural cemetery, <a href=\"https://laurelhillphl.com/about/history/\">Laurel Hill outside Philadelphia</a>, recorded all its plantings, representing over 175 different species, and created <a href=\"https://uscpress.com/Grave-Landscapes\">a guidebook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Plants grown in cemeteries were selected not only based on whether they could grow in the climate, but also for the symbolism of their shapes and historical associations of their species. Plants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118015872.ch21\">frequently represented</a> death and mourning, hope and immortality.</p>\n\n<p>Weeping willow trees with their long, dangling branches were popular in cemeteries due to their dramatic emotional and visual effects. <a href=\"https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/13474\">Evergreens symbolized eternal life</a>. Deciduous trees represented the cycle of life because they lose their leaves in the winter, and flowers are comforting. Plants like iris and rose, which return every year, symbolized immortality.</p>\n\n<h2>Death in the Victorian era</h2>\n\n<p>Within a few decades of the beginning of the rural cemetery movement, the Victorian era began. Because of large numbers of dead from plagues and wars, <a href=\"https://washcohistory.org/death-was-big-business-in-gilded-age-america/\">death was a big part of Victorian life</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The Victorians were interested in floriography – “flower language” – and <a href=\"https://oldcem.bc.ca/about-the-society/resources/gp_art/gp-arts/plant-and-floral/\">attached a symbolic meaning</a> to almost every flower known. Consequently, flowers and other plants became commonplace on headstones.</p>\n\n<p>This emphasis on botanical motifs on headstones contrasted the symbols that had been common on early gravestones in New England during colonial days. Many gravestones from those days had images such as <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds\">winged skulls and crossed bones</a>, representing the orthodox Puritan view that all humans were sinners. Mortal symbols on headstones were a reminder of death.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A stone carved with six symbols, including a skull and two bones crossed in an x.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699554/original/file-20251030-56-4a301s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some 18th-century gravestones had skulls and crossed bones, which were meant to remind the viewer of their mortality.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:18th_century_gravestone_in_the_kirkyard_of_St_Fergus_-_geograph.org.uk_-_726315.jpg\">Martyn Gorman</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Horticultural symbols</h2>\n\n<p>Each symbol’s meaning may vary with time and place.

The problem was more fundamental – their names couldn’t be found.</p>\n\n<p>The culprit was DNS, the <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dns-2022-09-13-en\">Domain Name System</a>, which is the <a href=\"https://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm\">internet’s phone book</a>. Every device on the internet has a numerical IP address, but people use names like amazon.com or maps.google.com. DNS acts as the translator, turning those names into the correct IP addresses so your device knows where to send the request. It works every time you click on a link, open an app or tap “log in.” Even when you don’t type a name yourself, such as in a mobile app, one is still being used in the background.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why DNS failures can be so disruptive, it’s helpful to know how the Domain Name System is constructed. The internet contains <a href=\"https://www.dnib.com/articles/the-domain-name-industry-brief-q3-2025\">over 378 million registered domain names</a>, far too many for a single global phone book. Imagine a single book containing every American’s name and phone number. So DNS was intentionally designed to be decentralized. </p>\n\n<p>Each organization that owns a domain, such as google.com, is responsible for maintaining its own DNS entries in its own DNS server. When your device needs to find an IP address, it asks a DNS server, which may ask others, until it finds the server that knows the answer. No single system has to hold everything. That’s what makes DNS resilient.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyH0nYhMW9M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Here’s how DNS works behind the scenes.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Centralization equals vulnerability</h2>\n\n<p>So why did AWS, the <a href=\"https://technologymagazine.com/articles/aws-remains-330bn-cloud-market-leader-driven-by-ai-growth\">largest cloud provider</a> in the world, still manage to break the internet for so many, from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/aws-outage-impact-what-happened-becce0e7\">Zoom to Venmo</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/business/amazon-aws-outage-eight-sleep-mattress.html\">and smart beds</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Cloud providers host web servers but also critical infrastructure services, including DNS. When a company rents cloud servers, it often allows the cloud provider to manage its DNS as well. That’s efficient – until the cloud provider’s DNS itself has a problem. </p>\n\n<p>Amazon disclosed that the specific cause of the recent disruption was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/a-single-point-of-failure-triggered-the-amazon-outage-affecting-millions/\">a timing bug</a> in the software that manages the AWS DNS management system. Whatever the cause, the effect was clear: Any website or service relying on AWS-managed DNS could not be reached, even if its server was perfectly healthy. In this way, the cloud concentrates risk. </p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t the first time DNS became a point of failure. In 2002, attackers attempted to disable the entire DNS system by <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/dns/oct02dos/\">launching a denial-of-service attack</a> against the root DNS servers, the systems that store the locations of all other DNS servers. In a denial-of-service attack, an attacker sends a flood of traffic to overwhelm a server. Five of the 13 root servers were knocked offline, but the system survived. </p>\n\n<p>In 2016, a major DNS provider called Dyn, which companies paid to run DNS on their behalf, was hit with a <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/\">massive distributed-denial-of-service attack</a>. In a distributed-denial-of-service attack, the attacker hijacks many computers and uses them to send the flood of traffic to the target. In the Dyn attack, tens of thousands of compromised devices flooded its servers, overwhelming them. For hours, major sites like Twitter, PayPal, Netflix and Reddit were functionally offline even though their servers were fully operational. Yet again, the issue wasn’t the websites; it was the inability to find them.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson is not that DNS is weak, but that reliance on a small number of providers creates invisible single points of failure. DNS was initially designed for decentralization. Yet, economic convenience, cloud services and DNS as a service are quietly steering the internet <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91425078/aws-outage-amazon-google-concentration\">toward centralization</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Convenience over resilience</h2>\n\n<p>These failures matter far beyond shopping or streaming. DNS is also how people reach banks, election reporting systems, emergency alert platforms and the artificial intelligence tools now powering critical decision-making. It doesn’t even need to fully go down to be dangerous. Simply delaying or misdirecting DNS can break authentication between users and services, block transactions or erode public trust at sensitive moments.</p>\n\n<p>The uncomfortable reality is that convenience is quietly winning over resilience. As organizations increasingly outsource DNS and hosting to the same handful of cloud providers, they accumulate what could be called resilience debt – invisible until the moment it comes due. The internet was engineered to survive partial failure, but modern economics is concentrating risk in ways its original designers explicitly tried to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson from the AWS outage isn’t just about fixing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/a-single-point-of-failure-triggered-the-amazon-outage-affecting-millions/\">one software bug</a>. It’s a reminder that DNS <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/app13095739\">is critical infrastructure</a>. That means technology companies can’t afford to treat DNS as background plumbing, and resilience needs to be designed intentionally. </p>\n\n<p>Individual DNS failures inconvenience people, but the reliability of DNS on the whole defines whether the internet still works at all.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268336/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Doug Jacobson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It is the largest, most complex, most expensive and most durable spacecraft ever built. </p>\n\n<p>Its first modules <a href=\"https://issnationallab.org/about/iss-national-lab-overview/iss-history-timeline/\">were launched in 1998</a>. The first crew to live on the International Space Station – an American and two Russians – entered it in 2000. Nov. 2, 2025, marks 25 years of continuous habitation by at least two people, and as many as 13 at one time. It is a singular example of international cooperation that has stood the test of time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-visitors-by-country/\">Two hundred and ninety people from 26 countries</a> have now visited the space station, several of them staying for a year or more. More than 40% of all the humans who have ever been to space have been International Space Station visitors. </p>\n\n<p>The station has been the locus of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/\">thousands of scientific and engineering studies</a> using almost 200 distinct scientific facilities, investigating everything from astronomical phenomena and basic physics to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/does-a-year-in-space-make-you-older-or-younger-111812\">crew health</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/taking-plants-off-planet-how-do-they-grow-in-zero-gravity-45032\">plant growth</a>. The phenomenon of <a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/space-tourism-the-past-present-and-future\">space tourism was born on the space station</a>.

There are cables everywhere. Equipment sticks out into corridors. It doesn’t look like Star Trek’s Enterprise or other science fiction spacecraft. There’s no shower for the crew, or a kitchen for cooking a meal from scratch. It doesn’t have an area designed for the crew to gather in their downtime. But even without those niceties, it clearly represents a vision of the future from the past, one where humanity would live permanently in space for the first time. </p>\n\n<h2>Space archaeology</h2>\n\n<p>November 2025, by coincidence, also marks the 10th anniversary of my team’s research on the space station, the <a href=\"https://issarchaeology.org\">International Space Station Archaeological Project</a>. The long history of habitation on the space station makes it perfect for the kind of studies that <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jVQ2-LkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">archaeologists like my colleagues and me</a> carry out. </p>\n\n<p>We recognized that there had been hardly any research on the social and cultural aspects of life in space. We wanted to show space agencies that were already planning three-year missions to Mars what they were overlooking.</p>\n\n<p>We wanted to go beyond just talking to the crew about their experiences, though we have also done that. But <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/archaeolog/GarbologyOnline/files/63674.pdf\">as previous studies of contemporary societies have shown</a>, people often don’t want to discuss all their lives with researchers, or they’re unable to articulate all their experiences. </p>\n\n<p>Astronauts on Earth are usually trying to get their next ride back to space, and they understandably don’t want to rock the boat. Our research provides an additional window onto life on a space station by using archaeological evidence: the traces of human interactions with the objects and built spaces of the site.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, of course, is that we can’t go to the station and observe it directly. So we had to come up with other ways to capture data. In November 2015, I realized that we could use the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore\">thousands of photos taken by the crew and published by NASA</a> as a starting point. These would allow us to track the movement of people and things around the site over time, and to map the behaviors and associations between them. </p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the International Space Station Archaeological Project also carried out <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/archaeologists-conduct-first-space-excavation-on-international-space-station-and-discover-surprising-quirks-of-zero-gravity-life-236125\">the first archaeological fieldwork off the Earth</a>, an experiment designed by my collaborator, <a href=\"https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/alice.gorman\">Alice Gorman</a>. We asked the crew to document six sample locations in different modules by taking photos of each one every day for two months.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699056/original/file-20251028-56-wkdoq7.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A view from one module of a space station into the airlock.

They <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/717778\">decorate the walls of the station</a> with pictures, memorabilia and, on the Russian side, religious items, the way you might put photos and souvenirs on your refrigerator door to say something about yourself and your family. They <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZmgSeupMuq/\">make birthday cakes for their colleagues</a>. They love to snack on candy or other special foods that they selected to be sent. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike the rest of us, however, they live <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.03.035\">without much freedom to make choices</a> about their lives. Their days are governed by lengthy procedures overseen by Mission Control, and by lists of items and their locations.</p>\n\n<p>Crew members do show some signs of autonomy, though. They sometimes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304229\">create new uses for different areas</a>. They used a maintenance work station for the storage of all kinds of unrelated things, just because it has a lot of Velcro for holding items in place. They have to come up with solutions for storing their toiletry kits because that kind of affordance wasn’t considered necessary by the station’s designers 30 or 40 years ago.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699057/original/file-20251028-56-40ud3g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The wall of a space station module.

But it probably isn’t the most efficient way to run what is the most expensive building project in the history of humanity. </p>\n\n<p>In our latest research, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/d9k4w\">we tracked changes in scientific activity</a>, which we found has become increasingly diverse, by documenting the use of specialized experimental equipment. This work was the result of questions from one of the companies competing to build a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nasa-will-say-goodbye-to-the-international-space-station-in-2030-and-welcome-in-the-age-of-commercial-space-stations-264936\">commercial successor to the International Space Station</a> in low Earth orbit. </p>\n\n<p>The company wanted to know if we could tell them what facilities their customers were likely going to need. Of course, understanding how people have used different parts of a site over time is a typical archaeological problem. They are using our results to improve the experiences of their crews. </p>\n\n<h2>The archaeology of the contemporary world</h2>\n\n<p>Similar archaeological studies of contemporary issues here on Earth can also make future lives better, whether by studying phenomena such as <a href=\"https://www.undocumentedmigrationproject.org/\">migration</a>, <a href=\"https://www.americananthropologist.org/insights/mcatackneybaucher\">ethnonationalism</a> or <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339247789_Discard_Emotions_and_Empathy_on_the_Margins_of_the_Waste_Stream\">ecological issues</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, we and other contemporary archaeologists are charting a new future for studying the past, a path for our discipline that lies alongside our traditional work of investigating ancient societies and managing heritage resources. Our International Space Station work also demonstrates the relevance of social science research for solving all kinds of problems – even ones that seem to be purely technical, like living in space.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268549/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>ISSAP received funding from the Australian Research Council.

Many mothers avoid medications and treatments during pregnancy for fear that they may cause harm to their unborn baby. Yet, most are unaware of the harms that untreated pain in pregnancy may cause.</p>\n\n<p>Like many women, I experienced severe pain in pregnancy. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=YnM3i3IAAAAJ\">As a nurse researcher</a>, I listen to women’s stories and analyze data from across the United States. I share these findings through publications, presentations and the media to raise awareness and reduce the suffering of untreated pregnancy pain.</p>\n\n<h2>Not just minor ‘discomfort’</h2>\n\n<p>Mothers are often told that the pain that comes with pregnancy is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.12323\">temporary discomfort</a> that comes with the territory – and ends as soon as the baby is born. </p>\n\n<p>But when pain and discomfort persist to the point that mothers cannot sleep, work and care for their other children, mothers are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">experiencing pain that needs to be addressed</a>. And for some mothers, the pain does not just eventually fade. Back pain and headaches, for example, can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12814\">last longer than three months</a>, becoming a chronic condition that affects overall health.</p>\n\n<p>Normal changes that occur during pregnancy often lead to pain. Pregnancy pain normally occurs from hormonal changes that can cause headaches and loosening of pelvic joints. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">loosening of joints and the weight</a> of the unborn baby contribute to back pelvic pain. The weight of the developing baby also causes the spine to abnormally curve, a <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23908-lordosis\">condition called lordosis</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Back and pelvic pain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">increase in the third trimester of pregnancy</a> when the weight of the baby is at its greatest. This is why it’s incredibly important for doctors and loved ones to believe mothers when they report pain. However, one meta-analysis, meaning an in-depth review of existing research, found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">more than 50% of mothers</a> who reported their pain received little to no treatment from their doctors.</p>\n\n<h2>Inadequacy of current treatments</h2>\n\n<p>Current treatments for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">pain during pregnancy are highly limited</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Tylenol, though safe – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-an-ob-gyn-i-see-firsthand-how-misleading-statements-on-acetaminophen-leave-expectant-parents-confused-fearful-and-lacking-in-options-265947\">despite the current controversy</a> – treats only mild pain and is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012230\">ineffective for moderate to severe muscle pain</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Alternative treatments that are also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">recommended and can be effective</a>, such as heat or cold applications, massage, chiropractic adjustments, exercise and physical therapy, may need to be used in unison and on an ongoing basis. These treatments are not always covered by insurance. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4\">most effective approach combines several treatments</a>, including exercise that may be provided through physical therapy. Unfortunately, this care may be costly for mothers without adequate insurance, and awareness of these options varies among providers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Mid-section view of a pregnant person wearing a back support strap around their belly.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699549/original/file-20251030-74-tvgaci.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A supportive belt or band can sometimes help with back pain.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pregnant-woman-puts-on-a-black-two-piece-bandage-royalty-free-image/2203296703?phrase=back%20pain%20pregnancy&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Anna Reshetnikova/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The harms of untreated pregnancy pain</h2>\n\n<p>My team’s research reveals that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/nmc.0000000000000724\">when mothers report pain during pregnancy</a> to their health care providers and loved ones, mothers are typically instructed to go home, rest, take Tylenol, go on maternity leave or a combination of these. However, this does not meet the needs of mothers who must work or care for other children. In addition, going on leave early is not an option for many mothers who desire to save their limited maternity leave for after the baby is born. </p>\n\n<p>Mothers will almost always continue to take care of their children or work at the expense of their health if they feel there are no other choices. However, when expectations from their work, family or themselves are not met, mothers may feel guilty about not being a good enough mother or employee. This cycle can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/nmc.0000000000000724\">contribute to mental health challenges</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When pain is left untreated, mothers may feel minimized, unheard and overwhelmed. In turn, they can start to feel helpless and hopeless, which are symptoms of depression. My colleagues and I found that approximately 44% of women with severe pain report moderate to severe depressive symptoms <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/NMC.0000000000000657\">during the third trimester of pregnancy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Untreated depression <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/more-than-4-in-5-pregnancy-related-deaths-are-preventable-in-the-us-and-mental-health-is-the-leading-cause-193909\">can also lead to suicide</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/344c26e2-cdf5-47df-a5d7-a2d444fc1923/APA-CDC-Perinatal-Mental-and-Substance-Use-Disorders-Whitepaper.pdf\">responsible for 5% to 20% of maternal deaths</a> in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>Equally important, opioid or narcotic pain relievers may be prescribed for pregnant mothers experiencing severe pain. Yet, 1 in 5 women with pain report <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-021-01206-3\">misusing these prescribed medications during pregnancy</a> to relieve pain. In turn, this increases the risk of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-029074\">newborns experiencing withdrawal</a> from these medications after birth, causing significant suffering. Sadly, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-029074\">neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome</a> is becoming more common, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-3520\">costing the country over US$462 million annually</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With suicide and drug overdoses now the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/344c26e2-cdf5-47df-a5d7-a2d444fc1923/APA-CDC-Perinatal-Mental-and-Substance-Use-Disorders-Whitepaper.pdf\">leading causes of death in the year after childbirth</a>, effective pain management in pregnancy is urgently needed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Pregnant mom squats near toddler in kitchen.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699553/original/file-20251030-64-ho250l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Pregnant mothers who have younger children may often push through pain and discomfort, which can contribute to greater distress.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/pregnant-mom-squats-near-toddler-in-kitchen-royalty-free-image/933843660?phrase=pregnant%20mother%20with%20toddler&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Stephen Simpson/Stone via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Being assertive about pregnancy pain</h2>\n\n<p>Managing pregnancy pain starts with open communication between the mother and their health care provider. Our studies reveal that by gently adjusting expectations, sharing how they feel and asking about available treatments, mothers can take an active role in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/nmc.0000000000000724\">ensuring their pain is understood and addressed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Pregnant mothers are strong, but it’s natural to slow down. Pregnancy is a time to listen to your body and adjust expectations. I believe that balance matters. If pain prevents you from lifting your toddler, that’s OK. What your child will remember the most are the moments you snuggled with them on the couch.</p>\n\n<p>My team’s studies reveal that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/nmc.0000000000000724\">talking to loved ones about pain may be a challenge</a>. So choose a calm, quiet time without distractions – when everyone can listen and respond thoughtfully. Be open about how you feel and clear about the help you need. Using “I” statements such as “I feel …” also helps. Allow for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Share reliable articles or invite loved ones to a medical appointment so they can better understand what you are experiencing. If someone dismisses your pain, reach out to others who are more supportive.</p>\n\n<p>It is also important to <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication/talking-your-doctor-or-health-care-provider\">start the conversation</a> with your doctor, midwife or nurse practitioner. Before your appointment, jot down your main concerns and any questions you would like to ask.</p>\n\n<p>Be honest about your pain, especially if it is preventing you from sleeping or doing your usual activities. Tell your provider whether the pain is constant or comes and goes, and describe what it feels like – achy, throbbing, sharp or dull. Even mild ongoing pain that disrupts rest or daily life is important.</p>\n\n<p>Share what you’ve already tried and how well those treatments have worked. If your pain is not improving, reach out to discuss other options, such as prescription medications or a referral to physical therapy. Sometimes, it takes more than one conversation to find relief.</p>\n\n<p>If your pain continues, ask about consulting with a specialist or another health care provider for a different perspective. If your pain improves with treatment but your insurance requests you stop, ask your provider to help appeal the decision. Ongoing treatment throughout pregnancy may be necessary to control your pain. </p>\n\n<p>Relief is possible when pain is taken seriously, not dismissed as an unavoidable harm of pregnancy.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268264/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julie Vignato received funding from the National Institutes of Health.

In the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/asthma-trends-brief/trends-and-burden\">1 in 7 people are diagnosed with asthma</a>, and that number is rising.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, researchers have identified a mix of individual and environmental factors that play a role in asthma. For instance, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/clt2.12207\">obesity and alcohol use</a> increase a person’s risk for asthma. And more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0019-2023\">extreme weather is linked to worse asthma symptoms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In that mix of research, a new pattern has emerged pointing to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.02.005\">links between asthma and abuse</a> by a current or former romantic partner. As surprising as that might sound, these links are important because intimate partner abuse is common in the U.S. An estimated 47% of women and 44% of men are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nisvs/about/index.html\">physically or sexually victimized or stalked by intimate partners</a> at some point in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://liberalarts.du.edu/about/people/anne-p-deprince\">psychologist</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/eileen-wang?tab=overview\">asthma specialist</a>, we have teamed up to learn more about asthma and intimate partner abuse. </p>\n\n<p>And what we’re seeing has important implications for treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>The role of inflammation</h2>\n\n<p>To understand how factors such as obesity or extreme weather can result in asthma, researchers have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503\">focused on inflammation</a>. Inflammation plays a key role in keeping humans and other animals healthy.</p>\n\n<p>When pathogens such as viruses attack the body, or the body suffers an injury, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.23208\">immune system responds with inflammation</a>. This immediate, short-term response helps the body minimize damage to cells and fight infection. It’s also what causes the red hotness that surrounds a skin injury or bothersome symptoms when fighting a cold.</p>\n\n<p>While short-term inflammation is critical to good health, the inflammation system can go awry. Chronic inflammation contributes to many kinds of diseases, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11172764\">including asthma</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Uncontrolled inflammation drives <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.161.1.9802048\">asthma development and symptoms</a>.

After all, intimate partner abuse is linked with a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08336-8\">host of health problems</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2006.10.001\">health care costs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Using a large database that was representative of the U.S. population, one of us (Dr. Wang) led a team in 2021 that discovered intimate partner abuse was associated with <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2021.06.023\">worsened asthma attacks and symptoms</a>. That study included over 2,600 adults and found that having asthma along with a history of intimate partner abuse meant significantly greater odds of asthma attacks, more frequent symptoms and greater impact of symptoms on daily life. </p>\n\n<p>This pattern was true even for adults who were out of the abusive relationships for a year or more, suggesting a persistent effect of intimate partner abuse on asthma.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, other research teams also found links between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2021.12.018\">intimate partner abuse and increased rates</a> of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2023.03.016\">having or developing asthma</a> for adults.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, research showed that intimate partner abuse also affects the next generation. Multiple studies have shown increased rates of asthma in children of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.555\">women who were abused by their intimate partners</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A new view of inflammation</h2>\n\n<p>So, does this mean that intimate partner abuse leads to chronic overinflammation, which in turn causes asthma? Not necessarily, according to another study we did.</p>\n\n<p>We worked with a team of researchers to recruit 60 adults with uncontrolled asthma into our study and examined many different markers of inflammation in the blood. Importantly, about half of those adults told us they had been abused by an intimate partner at some time in their lives. And about half said they had not.</p>\n\n<p>First, we looked at the traditional types of inflammation studied in prior asthma research, including those targeted by currently available treatments. On measure after measure, our team found that patients with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/all.16621\">histories of intimate partner abuse had lower inflammation</a> than those without histories of abuse, despite having uncontrolled asthma. </p>\n\n<p>Surprised by this finding, we tested whether other factors that have been linked with asthma could better explain what we found. However, the pattern was still there – even when we took into account factors such as gender, obesity, anxiety and depression. </p>\n\n<p>Next, we looked closely at the histories of abuse that patients reported. Most were out of the abusive relationship for more than a year. Therefore, these new findings offer additional evidence that intimate partner abuse can affect people’s health long after the trauma has ended. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, these findings have important implications for public health and the treatment of asthma. Current asthma treatments target specific types of overinflammation. However, survivors of intimate partner abuse had lower levels of the types of inflammation that medications target. That could be key to understanding why survivors are more likely than other patients to have uncontrolled asthma even with treatment. </p>\n\n<p>Our recent findings suggest that intimate partner abuse may be linked to asthma through other biological mechanisms, such as alternative or nontraditional types of inflammation. More research is needed to identify what drives asthma among survivors so more effective treatments can be developed.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263508/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Anne P.

The science can feel contradictory and confusing. Human data is messy, and studies often yield conflicting results.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv\">Sparring between government officials and scientists</a> can muddy the picture further. </p>\n\n<p>As professors who <a href=\"https://publichealth.wustl.edu/people/kimberly-j-johnson/\">teach epidemiology</a> and <a href=\"https://brownschool.washu.edu/faculty-and-research/amy-eyler/\">research methods</a> to public health students, we start our students off with a few key questions that can help make sense of the evidence. We’ve come to realize that these lessons aren’t just for public health experts – they are tools that anyone can use to cut through bias, evaluate health claims and better understand health-related policy debates.</p>\n\n<p>So next time you read a news article making a claim about a particular health condition, ask yourself these three questions.</p>\n\n<h2>No. 1: Are people getting this illness more often?</h2>\n\n<p>Media reports often highlight changes in how frequently a condition is diagnosed. Take, for example, “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279\">Autism rates in US rise again to 1 in 31 kids, CDC says</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/prediabetes-cdc-adolescents-data-cf752de21856b2886450621d85d93370\">CDC finds nearly 1 in 3 US youth have prediabetes, but experts question scant data</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Before raising the alarm about an unfolding epidemic, it’s important to consider whether the changes in rates are due to what public health researchers call artifactual changes or if they are true changes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman measures blood pressure at her home.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699509/original/file-20251030-56-hbkt1u.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When the American Heart Association lowered the cutoff for diagnosing high blood pressure, more people were suddenly deemed to have the condition.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/senior-woman-measures-blood-pressure-at-her-home-royalty-free-image/1459639443\">J_art/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Artifactual changes can occur even when the rate of a disease or condition in the population has not actually changed. When researchers revise how they define a particular condition, the number of people counted as having it can change over time. Autism rates, for example, have increased at least partially due to an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/opinion/why-autism-rates-increased.html\">expanded definition of autism</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Another example is a change in what classifies someone as having high blood pressure. In 2017, the American Heart Association <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.19672\">lowered the cutoff</a> for diagnosing hypertension from 140/90 to 130/80. As a result, almost overnight, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/more-americans-meet-criteria-for-high-blood-pressure-under-new-guidelines-263507\">more people were considered to have the condition</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A condition’s rate can also appear to increase when doctors become better at detecting it. The widespread adoption of the PSA test, short for prostate-specific antigen test, a blood test for prostate cancer detection, in the early 1990s resulted in a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1995.03520310046028\">surge in prostate cancer diagnoses</a>. Some fraction of these cases were detected at such an early stage that they may never have progressed to cause illness or death during the patient’s lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>Increased awareness of a condition due to media reports or public discussion can also result in more diagnoses. That’s especially true when diagnosis is not based on a definitive medical test but instead on clinical observations or reports. For example, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616454/\">increases in ADHD cases over time</a> may partly reflect <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-overdiagnosed-257108\">increased recognition and diagnosis</a> as awareness grows.</p>\n\n<p>True changes in the rates of a disease or health condition reflect real shifts in the factors that cause a condition to become more or less common in a population.</p>\n\n<p>A classic example of a true change in a disease rate is smoking and lung cancer. Early in the 1900s, lung cancer was a rare disease in the United States. By the 1930s, doctors were noticing more cases in men, leading to studies investigating its <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2589239/\">potential causes, including smoking</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the results of numerous studies reviewed by the U.S. surgeon general’s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health in the early 1960s, the committee concluded that smoking was a primary cause of lung cancer. In the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-SMOKINGANDHEALTH/pdf/GPO-SMOKINGANDHEALTH.pdf\">surgeon general’s landmark report</a> published in 1964, which drew upon evidence from over 7,000 scientific and technical articles, the committee concluded that “cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and the overall death rate.”</p>\n\n<h2>No. 2: What kind of study led to this claim?</h2>\n\n<p>The strongest studies compare a control group, which does not receive the intervention being tested, and an experimental group, which does. Study participants are randomly assigned to one of these groups. This type of study design, called a <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies\">randomized controlled trial</a>, is considered the gold standard for proving when a treatment or other factor truly causes or prevents a disease. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A pharmacologist talking to a patient in a research laboratory.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699513/original/file-20251030-56-5u6yve.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some studies evaluating a health condition can test an intervention directly, while others observe something that a patient is already experiencing.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-pharmacology-expert-conduct-tests-on-a-senior-royalty-free-image/2241467590\">Dragos Condrea/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>However, a randomized controlled trial cannot be used to study potentially harmful factors such as pesticides or other chemicals found in our everyday environments. Exposing people to potentially harmful exposures would not be ethical. Instead, researchers need to rely on <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies\">observational studies</a>, which identify people who are already exposed to some factor in their daily lives – for example, those who work with pesticides – and compare their health outcomes to people who are not exposed to pesticides. </p>\n\n<p>The challenge with observational studies is that the two groups of people often differ in unpredictable ways – and these differences might partly explain why one group has a higher rate of a certain disease or health condition. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-study-claiming-vaccines-cause-chronic-illness-is-severely-flawed-a-biostatistician-explains-the-biases-and-unsupported-conclusions-265470\">This is known as confounding</a>. Statistical methods used to control for these differences between the groups are often imperfect. This is why it’s risky to draw conclusions from a single study.</p>\n\n<h2>No. 3: What other evidence is there?</h2>\n\n<p>Because a single study cannot prove cause and effect, experts review the total body of research on a topic, like a jury weighing all the testimony before rendering a verdict. Evidence often includes a combination of study types, including randomized clinical trials, observational studies and laboratory research. Randomized clinical trials test whether an intervention actually changes outcomes under controlled conditions, while observational studies look for patterns and associations in real-world populations. Laboratory research aims to uncover biological mechanisms linking a potential cause to a disease, and it is usually conducted under artificial circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>For example, many studies have investigated the effects of chemicals in cigarette smoke. On balance, they have found that such chemicals cause cancer by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/91.14.1194\">damaging genetic material</a> in lung cells. When this damage affects key genes, it can trigger the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer\">cells to divide uncontrollably</a> and lead to the development of cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Once scientists rule out explanations based in artifacts such as more people being classified with a condition due to changing definitions, they can combine evidence from a range of studies on a topic to build a convincing case for whether the factor they are investigating truly causes or prevents a disease or other condition. They weigh all the evidence because no single study settles the question, but together the pieces form a clearer picture. </p>\n\n<p>The bottom line? If you see a health claim that seems too good – or too bad – to be true, take a moment to mentally run the evidence through these three questions before deciding what to believe.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266472/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Seventeen-year-old Nathaniel Isaacs tied himself to a railing to avoid being washed overboard. The Mary’s rudder soon splintered against a rocky bar at the entrance to Natal Bay – what is now Durban, South Africa. Helpless to maneuver, the ship took on water.</p>\n\n<p>It was Oct. 1, 1825. Isaacs, a Jewish apprentice merchant from England, loosed the rope around his waist and jumped for his life, landing on the edge of the Zulu kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Though his name is virtually unknown today, Isaacs went on to play a pivotal role during the period of first contact between the Zulu and Europeans. His widely reviewed 1836 memoir, “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/travelsadventure01isaa\">Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa</a>,” offers an eyewitness account of the Zulu under the indomitable King Shaka, who reigned from the 1810s to 1828. As I learned while researching my 2025 book, “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-jew-who-would-be-king/hardcover\">The Jew Who Would Be King</a>,” Isaacs’ writing shaped the mythology around Shaka Zulu, who endures as a Black nationalist icon. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://kingshakainternational.co.za/\">South African airport</a> is named after Shaka, and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.gov.za/press-releases/parliament-statement-heritage-day\">the country’s Heritage Day</a> is held on the supposed date of his assassination. But his fame stretches far beyond. </p>\n\n<p>He has been name-checked in hip-hop culture for decades, including by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkLgIpcvtU\">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ2MwwV8a-Y\">Travis Scott</a>. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Camden_Market_-_Camden_Lock_Place_-_Shaka_Zulu_Restaurant_Bar_Club_-_statue.jpg\">An enormous sculpture of Shaka</a> marks the now defunct Shaka Zulu nightclub in London, while <a href=\"https://www.shaka-zulu.de/\">a bar</a> keeps his name alive in Germany. In the U.S. he lends his name to <a href=\"https://shakawear.com/\">a streetwear brand</a>, and his fearsome scowl adorns stickers and T-shirts. Recently, a South African miniseries, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/shaka-ilembe-finally-a-tv-series-on-the-zulu-king-thats-true-to-language-and-culture-256497\">well-received by scholars</a>, has revived his legacy for a new generation.  </p>\n\n<h2>‘Lost tribe’ speculation</h2>\n\n<p>The fact that an Anglo-Jewish castaway helped forge Shaka’s legend seems surprising today. But in 19th-century England, this unlikely pairing would have made perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>The prevailing pseudoscience of the time concluded that Jews and Africans shared the <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/218/edited_volume/chapter/2817908\">same imagined racial essence</a>. Given this fanciful equivalency, British voyagers and missionaries “found” the lost tribes of Israel wherever they looked, whether among <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479866366/old-canaan-in-a-new-world/\">the Native populations of North America</a> or <a href=\"https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/399/in-and-out-of-africa/#\">Indigenous peoples in Africa</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white illustration of a man wearing a breastplate and skirt, holding a large shield and spear.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=811&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=811&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=811&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1019&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1019&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698190/original/file-20251023-56-l2lohd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1019&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A print of Shaka, designed by William Bagg, which appeared in Nathaniel Isaacs’ memoir.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KingShaka.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Isaacs himself suspected the Zulu of having a Jewish origin. In one letter, he described Shaka as possessing facial features that revealed “a Hebrew expression” – wishful thinking that echoed a wider cultural belief. </p>\n\n<p>In other ways, Isaacs was a sober observer, describing Zulu politics, military tactics, family dynamics and rituals. In his memoir he describes Shaka as <a href=\"https://sahistory.org.za/people/shaka-zulu\">a powerful empire-builder</a> who shrewdly assimilated conquered tribes and territory into his realm – large portions of what is today eastern South Africa. Oral histories confirm Isaacs’ assessment, with one Zulu witness noting that Shaka “established colonies like the Europeans.” According to another, <a href=\"https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N14000076\">the Zulu king welcomed Isaacs</a> and “deliberately made friends of the first settlers” who washed up on Zulu lands. </p>\n\n<h2>‘Savage’ stereotypes</h2>\n\n<p>Isaacs made the most of Shaka’s hospitality – a sharp contrast to the king’s supposed ferocity, which remains a core part of Shaka’s legend.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/travelsadventure01isaa/page/n9/mode/2up\">his first visit to the “sanguinary chief</a>,” as Isaacs referred to Shaka, he witnessed the king order the seizure of three disobedient subjects. Their necks were broken and they were dragged away to the bush to be impaled, their bowels punctured. Some scholars <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674874466\">believe Isaacs sensationalized Shaka’s violence</a> – such as historian <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PYTy1KEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Carolyn Hamilton</a> – yet assert that “Travels and Adventures” remains one of the most valuable sources of Shakan history.</p>\n\n<p>Zulu witnesses also emphasized Shaka’s brutality. According to Magidigidi,  who was born during Shaka’s reign and served as a mat-bearer, a kind of military page, the king was known as “<a href=\"https://emandulo.apc.uct.ac.za/metadata/Stuart/3648/3650/3763/3764/index.html\">the wrong-doer who knows no law</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Europeans commonly exaggerated the cruelties of African leaders, often portraying them as “savages.” To many colonial writers of the time, reason, science, private property and commerce marked “civilization.” Irrationality, superstition, communal living and barter marked “savagery” – though they believed cultures and individuals could progress from one state to the other.</p>\n\n<p>Isaacs detailed Shaka’s “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/travelsadventure01isaa/page/n9/mode/2up\">savage propensities</a>,” indicating that he saw his own culture as superior. Chauvinism can, of course, easily transmute into coarse racism. Yet he also treated the Zulu with admiration, praising men and women for their athleticism, agility, bravery, cleanliness, discipline and hospitality. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Racial pseudoscience</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps Isaacs’ praise of the Zulu derived in part from his Jewish identity; he too would have been <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/trials-of-the-diaspora-9780199600724?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">dismissed as “savage” in England</a>. As historian <a href=\"https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/derek-penslar\">Derek Penslar</a> writes, Jews were imagined as “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/shylocks-children/hardcover\">crass and venal</a>, lacking honor and virtue, in thrall to a slave religion or unrestrained passion.” </p>\n\n<p>The presumed inferiority of Jews meant that European Christians often considered them “black,” both metaphorically and physically. Physician and early anthropologist James Cowles Prichard wrote that depending on the climate in which Jews lived they could become swarthy, even black. One implication of Prichard’s belief was that <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo3621533.html\">environment and culture shaped race</a>, which was thought to be a more mutable category of identity than people often consider it today. </p>\n\n<p>Cultural historian <a href=\"https://web.gs.emory.edu/vulnerability/faculty/bios/gilman-sander.html\">Sander Gilman</a> <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/1829/jewish-self-hatred?srsltid=AfmBOorP_1UmYrg7flhqDV8dLDi3DlqjQN24RzMoCuyrN--Lk6zbwRpC\">summarized this curious history</a>: “In the eyes of the non-Jew who defined them in Western society the Jews became the blacks.” </p>\n\n<p>H. Rider Haggard, the English novelist and former civil servant in South Africa, played on this imagined connection between Jews and Black Africans. “<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2166\">King Solomon’s Mines</a>,” published in 1885, depicts a breakaway Zulu enclave as the source for the biblical King’s riches.</p>\n\n<p>Isaacs’ “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/travelsadventure01isaa/page/n9/mode/2up\">Travels and Adventures</a>” avoids such wild speculation, but he does note King Shaka’s fascination with Judeo-Christian theology. One night, Shaka invited him to speak about faith. “The religion of our nation taught us to believe in a Supreme Being,” Isaacs explained, a god who “created all things, and was the giver of light and life.” Shaka “seemed as if struck with profound astonishment” when Isaacs regaled him with the biblical account of creation.</p>\n\n<h2>Kingly legacy</h2>\n\n<p>Isaacs was equally spellbound by the Zulu. He hunted elephants for ivory, established a homestead and distinguished himself in battle. Shaka rewarded him with a praise name – a great honor – and the title of “induna,” a chieftain or headman.</p>\n\n<p>Isaacs, in turn, lauded Shaka’s highly disciplined and militarized kingdom. Following his lead, Haggard <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1207\">lavished praise on Shaka’s genius</a>, noting that the Zulu military was among “the most wonderful that the world has seen.” More recently, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/\">Marvel’s “Black Panther</a>” features a former king of an isolationist African state jealously guarding its military supremacy. The king’s name? T’Chaka.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A tiered monument says 'Tshaka,' as well as a longer inscription in smaller letters.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698194/original/file-20251023-56-5oava6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1005&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A monument marks Shaka’s grave in KwaDukuza, South Africa.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Adam Rovner</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>African writers have likewise shrouded Shaka in legends of martial prowess. Zulu scholar, author and exiled African National Congress activist Mazisi Kunene’s epic “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/emperorshakagrea00kune\">Emperor Shaka the Great</a>,” published in 1979, hews to Isaacs’ depiction of a fierce yet noble Shaka. </p>\n\n<p>Isaacs even appears in Kunene’s work, which advanced Zulu nationalism in the face of apartheid. The titular King Shaka declares that Isaacs “possessed true humanity,” and one of Shaka’s advisers counsels that Isaacs should be considered a Zulu and no longer be treated as “a foreigner or white man.”</p>\n\n<p>Two hundred years after Isaacs’ shipwreck, much of Shaka’s legend can still be traced back to the travels and adventures of a teenage Jewish Zulu chief.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265569/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adam L.

While unverified, these reports are indicative of the short-range <a href=\"https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/venezuela-threatens-us-navy-with-su-30mk2-jets-armed-with-kh-31-ship-killer-missiles\">air defense and anti-ship capabilities</a> being supplied by nations friendly to the Maduro regime.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 28, a <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2025/10/28/heavy-russian-cargo-plane-lands-in-caracas-amid-us-venezuela-tensions/\">Russian Il-76 heavy cargo plane</a>, operated by a sanctioned carrier tied to Russian military logistics, landed in Caracas after a multistop route through the Caucasus and West Africa. If not an outright sign of solidarity, this is a signal that Russia can <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2025/10/28/heavy-russian-cargo-plane-lands-in-caracas-amid-us-venezuela-tensions/\">airlift advisers, parts and munitions at will</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Iran’s long, quiet hand is visible in Venezuela’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/iran-may-be-outsourcing-kamikaze-drone-production-venezuela\">drone program</a>. It was <a href=\"https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-discover-how-venezuela-uses-iranian-drones-to-boost-precision-strikes-and-coastal-defenses\">reportedly seeded</a> with Mohajer-2 kits and expanded over the years into armed and surveillance platforms assembled at state plants by Tehran-trained technicians.</p>\n\n<p>Cuba, for its part, has for more than a decade embedded intelligence and internal security advisers across Venezuela’s military services, an underdiscussed force multiplier that helps the regime <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/venezuela-cuba-military/\">police dissent</a> and maintain loyalty.</p>\n\n<p>Although Russia, Cuba and Iran may help Maduro survive, they are unlikely to save him from any determined American campaign.</p>\n\n<h2>Cautious opposition</h2>\n\n<p>If Washington is hoping that its military squeeze may encourage Venezuelans to take matters into their own hands, the domestic scene is less favorable. The opposition to Maduro is fragmented and vulnerable after being deprived, fraudulently by most accounts, victory in a 2024 vote and a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/venezuela\">year of repression</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Democratic Unitary Platform remains split between a pressure wing and a participation wing after the disputed vote. The jolt of morale handed to the opposition on Oct. 10, when the de facto 2024 opposition candidate María Corina Machado <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/the-nobel-peace-prize-2025-maria-corina-machado/\">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a>, has yet to move the needle.</p>\n\n<p>There is a low probability, in my opinion, that the opposition can forcibly remove Maduro without a trigger, such as a major split within the security services, sustained mass mobilization with elite defections, or a massive U.S. intervention. </p>\n\n<p>The regime’s domestic security architecture and control of courts, prosecutors and the electoral council make a sudden elite split unlikely. Electoral displacement is also unpromising given that the official opposition is split on tactics, faces daily repression, and Maduro has repeatedly signaled he will not accept a loss – even if he loses.</p>\n\n<p>Street power, backed by sustained international leverage and U.S. military threats, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/the-nobel-peace-prize-2025-maria-corina-machado/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">are arguably the opposition’s best asset</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Diaspora politics are febrile. South Florida’s large Venezuelan exile community <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/south-florida-venezuelan-community-reacts-to-trump-ordered-vessel-strike-off-venezuelas-coast/\">reads the naval buildup</a> as a potential turning point and lobbies accordingly, even as U.S. immigration and travel policies <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/miami/2025/06/06/trump-travel-ban-miami-response\">cut against</a> their interests. The opposition’s mainstream leaders still mouth the catechism that change should come by Venezuelan hands, but more are openly courting external pressure to tilt the balance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A large ship is seen at sea.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699591/original/file-20251030-56-vbrpg6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The USS Gravely, a US Navy warship, departs the Port of Spain on Oct. 30, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-uss-gravely-a-us-navy-warship-departs-the-port-of-port-news-photo/2243612919?adppopup=true\">Martin Bernetti/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What Washington might do next</h2>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has certainly shown willingness to mount pressure on Maduro and encourage his opponents. Since August, the Pentagon has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/venezuela-and-us-edge-toward-war-footing-but-domestic-concerns-international-risks-may-hold-washington-back-266509\">surged forces, destroyers and amphibious ships</a> into the U.S. Southern Command’s patch. Then, on Oct. 24, <a href=\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/10/24/us-to-deploy-uss-gerald-r-ford-to-latin-america/\">Washington redirected</a> the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group to the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, attacks against suspected drug vessels will likely continue.</p>\n\n<p>The campaign has already <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/trump-military-drug-caribbean-venezuela-timeline-strike\">resulted</a> in at least 13 strikes and 57 killed in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific. And President Donald Trump has been consistent in linking the targeted cartels to Venezuela’s government and Maduro directly. Should the U.S. wish to escalate further, precision strikes on Venezuelan territory <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/26/trump-venezuela-boat-strikes-lindsey-graham\">are not out of the question</a>. With an aircraft carrier nearby and F-35s staged in Puerto Rico, the Pentagon has options.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, covert actions will accompany any overt military posturing. The White House has <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/16/trump-confirms-the-cia-is-conducting-covert-operations-inside-venezuela/\">openly declared</a> that the CIA has authority to operate inside Venezuela. A U.S. Homeland Security agent reportedly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dhs-plan-capture-maduro-pilot-planes-7915d5a0819ceb518a8ca2b47da8b2e5\">tried to recruit</a> Maduro’s chief pilot to fly the president into U.S. custody, a plot that fizzled but hints at the psychological ops now in play. Venezuela, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-condemns-military-provocation-by-cia-trinidad-tobago-2025-10-26/\">condemned</a> “military provocation” by the CIA and others.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth recalling past attempts to unseat Maduro, including a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-failed-assassination-plot-arrests-today-2018-08-05/\">drone attack</a> at a Caracas parade and a failed <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/08/08/venezuela-green-berets-maduro-raid\">freelance operation</a> in 2020 that ended with deaths and dozens captured, including two former U.S. soldiers. The U.S. has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/venezuela-donald-trump-denies-link-raid-us-citizens\">denied</a> any connection to both incidents.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, such operations seldom topple strongmen – but they do <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/trump-venezuela-cia-maduro-covert-action\">seed paranoia</a> and crackdowns as regimes chase ghosts.</p>\n\n<h2>Possible endgames</h2>\n\n<p>If Washington’s real objective is regime change, the plausible outcomes are sobering. To be sure, a quick collapse of Maduro’s government is unlikely. A short, sharp campaign that dismantles the regime’s coercive tools could trigger elite defection. Yet Cuba-hardened internal security, patronage over the generals and years of sanctions-induced siege mentality make a palace coup improbable on a timetable that suits Washington.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, a slow squeeze is likelier.</p>\n\n<p>A hybrid strategy involving maritime and air pressure, covert agitation and inducements, targeted strikes to degrade regime capacity, and political, legal and cyber warfare to isolate Caracas and split the officer corps is realistic. But that path risks entrenching the regime’s hard-liners and worsening a humanitarian crisis even as it degrades Maduro’s capacity. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/trump-venezuela-maduro-regime-change/\">Analysts warn</a> that the regime change logic, once engaged, is hard to calibrate, especially if <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/trump-venezuela-maduro-regime-change/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">strikes kill civilians or hit national symbols</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A boomerang is always possible. Military action will very likely rally nationalist sentiment in Venezuela, fracture hemispheric consensus and drag the U.S. into a longer confrontation with messy spillovers, from uncontrolled migration to maritime security threats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"People in fatigues stand around, one holding a poster.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699588/original/file-20251030-74-2rdtd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A Venezuelan militiawoman holds a banner with a photo of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a military parade on April 13, 2019.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/venezuelan-militiawoman-holds-a-banner-with-a-photo-of-news-photo/1136920278?adppopup=true\">Marco Bello/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>It is worth recalling that approximately <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/emergencies/venezuela-situation#.\">7.9 million migrants and refugees</a> have already left Venezuela, with over 6.7 million residing in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Even the successful decapitation of Maduro’s regime would not guarantee a successor able to govern the country.</p>\n\n<p>At least three signposts matter in determining what happens next. </p>\n\n<p>The first is airlift cadence: More Russian cargo flights into Caracas point to accelerated military and technical aid. A second is the expansion of U.S. targets – a strike on a military installation or <a href=\"https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2731890-trump-does-not-rule-out-removing-venezuela-leader\">a presidential bunker</a> would cross a political Rubicon, even if framed as a counter-narcotics operation. The third is opposition mobilization. If there are credible signs of Venezuelan demonstrations, protests and action, this will shape Washington’s appetite for escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But even if the White House clings to its current counter-drugs and counterterrorism narrative, all evidence points to the trajectory as an incremental regime change push with less than certain outcomes.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268693/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Muggah is the co-founder of the Igarape Institute, a think and do tank in Brazil and a principal and co-founder of SecDev, a geopolitical and digital advisory group.

The peace plan includes a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-aims-keep-grip-gaza-security-cant-commit-disarm-senior-official-says-2025-10-17/\">Hamas commitment to return all hostages</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2elr16jjqo\">withdrawal of Israeli forces</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In late October, both sides said they remained committed to peace, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdy5eevn2o\">despite Israeli retaliation</a> for the death of an Israeli soldier that killed 104 people, and despite the fact that the remains of 11 deceased hostages remain in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Those setbacks aside, the new peace push is the most serious attempt so far to end the escalation of conflict that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants on Israelis.</p>\n\n<p>But what are the circumstances and actions that helped Trump advance such an agreement, the likes of which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3yke64vp6o\">eluded former President Joe Biden</a>? And what enabled Trump, working with a few close advisers and with <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/role-trump-play-latest-israel-hamas-deal-analysis/story?id=126360429\">mediators like Qatar and Egypt</a>, to overcome the reluctance of Israel and Hamas?</p>\n\n<p>The answer may have much to do with how Trump countered a phenomenon that political scientists call “<a href=\"https://iupress.org/9780253042392/spoiling-and-coping-with-spoilers/\">spoiling</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>“Spoiling” in peace negotiations is defined by political scientist <a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/spoiler-problems-peace-processes\">Stephen Stedman</a> as actions employed by “leaders and parties who believe that peace emerging from negotiations threatens their power, worldview, and interests, and use violence to undermine attempts to achieve it.”</p>\n\n<p>In regard to the Middle East, critics have long accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of playing this spoiler card throughout the war.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu was seen by many observers to be not <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/06/middleeast/analysis-netanyahu-war-over-hostage-deal-latam-intl\">interested in reaching a peace agreement</a> because of risks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/463898/netanyahu-political-survival-war\">the political survival of his governing coalition</a>. And it’s evident in attempts to postpone the investigation of the colossal <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/judicial-coup/2025-10-22/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-coalition-blocks-knesset-proposal-for-october-7-state-probe-angering-families/0000019a-0ba0-dae0-a59b-abf043830000\">failure of Israel to defend its citizens on Oct. 7</a>, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>For two years, Netanyahu engaged in this kind of spoiling by, for example, staging high-level <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ewr870z23o\">assassinations of Hamas leaders</a> at a timing detrimental for any negotiation’s success.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Netanyahu also employed a more sophisticated method of spoiling, one that political science scholar <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=enwaqREAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Ehud Eiran</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K47kws8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">I are exploring</a> in our research.</p>\n\n<p>We argue that leaders can spoil negotiations not just by resorting to violent means, or by posing hard-line positions within the negotiation room. Additionally, spoilers can work in broad daylight and make the diplomacy less likely to succeed through a careful use of rhetoric and media. This decreases their own constituencies’ and the enemy’s likelihood of accepting This decreases the likelihood of their own constituencies or the enemy accepting a compromise.

High-level officers in the prime minister’s office then stole a document from Israeli intelligence, allegedly written by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, forged some of it, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/magazine/benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-war.html?unlocked_article_code=1.V08.sA-B.DwgF1f3fbBoY\">leaked it to the German newspaper Bild</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu then cited the document in a speech, claiming <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/magazine/benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-war.html?unlocked_article_code=1.V08.sA-B.DwgF1f3fbBoY\">Sinwar designed his policy to use public pressure</a> on Netanyahu. In short, he used this false publication, leaked allegedly by his own people, to suggest that the protesters were doing Hamas’ bidding. The protests subsequently decreased dramatically, and the pressure on Netanyahu to compromise subsided. </p>\n\n<p>This pattern continued into the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<h2>‘No daylight’</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. decision-makers, from the president to negotiators in the Biden and Trump administrations, were no doubt aware of these practices. So why did they allow them to continue? </p>\n\n<p>The answer is complicated. What has become clear, I believe, is that at the heart of the problem stands a single phrase: “<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-11-21/ty-article/having-no-daylight-between-the-u-s-and-israel-is-fiction/0000017f-ecf5-dc91-a17f-fcfdabf30000\">no daylight</a>.” It’s an oft-cited position of U.S. politicians to mean that, publicly at least, Israel and the United States act as if they are in complete agreement or alignment, with no policy differences between them.</p>\n\n<p>Though a longtime ally of Israel, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/books/peace-process/\">the U.S. used to be more forceful with Israel</a> when the latter was deemed by Washington to have crossed the line or threatened important American interests in the region. That was evident when the U.S. imposed <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/arab-israeli-war-1973\">a ceasefire in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War</a> despite Israeli opposition. It was also clear when the U.S. prevented an Israeli response to missiles that Iraq launched at it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/20/world/war-gulf-president-bush-urges-israeli-restraint-phone-appeals-shamir.html\">during the Gulf War</a> in 1991.</p>\n\n<p>But in the past few decades, a perception has taken hold in U.S. foreign policy circles that pressure on Israel’s government should only be done in private and that it should <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/lies-america-tells-itself-about-middle-east-gaza?check_logged_in=1\">never include strong public rebuke</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A bomb explodes on a crowded enclave.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699036/original/file-20251028-66-klf1w4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Smoke and explosions rise inside the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, on March 17, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/MideastWarAnniversaryGazaDestructionTakeaways/1be20b43611e426c9d1181609050619a/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Ariel Schalit, File</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Thus, even when, in June 2024, the Biden administration knew full well that Netanyahu was thwarting efforts to reach a ceasefire, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken came out with a <a href=\"https://eg.usembassy.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinkens-remarks-to-the-press/\">statement blaming Hamas</a>. And when Netanyahu breached a ceasefire in March 2025 and ordered the military to return to fighting, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/17/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-hamas-ceasefire-intl-hnk\">the Trump administration blamed Hamas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu, with his knowledge of U.S. politics, was well aware that Washington would be unlikely to publicly blame Israel. And he took full advantage of this fact to promote his spoiling of the ceasefire negotiations in broad daylight. </p>\n\n<h2>No choice but to sign</h2>\n\n<p>So what changed in October 2025 that allowed Trump to overcome Netanyahu’s actions as a spoiler and secure a ceasefire?</p>\n\n<p>In short, Trump simply decided to play the same game. He publicly announced that the deal existed and left Netanyahu no choice but to sign it to preserve the perception that there is “no daylight” between Israel and the U.S. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-gaza-deal.html\">a former Netanyahu aide suggested</a>, “Trump is unpredictable and will not fall in line with the Israeli position.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s announcement of the deal, before many of the details were agreed upon, enabled the ceasefire agreement, Israel’s partial withdrawal from Gaza and Hamas’ release of the Israeli hostages.</p>\n\n<p>The road to an actual end of the war, not to mention <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-declares-end-israel-hamas-war-experts-hard/story?id=126482789\">Trump’s lofty declarations</a> of a historic peace, is still in the far distance. But the ceasefire, if it holds, is a critical step, in my view, to end this terrible chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267810/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Boaz Atzili is related to two Israeli citizens who were held hostage by Hamas following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.</span></em></p>",

Puerto Ricans in Chicago, New York and Florida organized relief efforts, raised funds and shipped supplies within days.</p>\n\n<p>Months later, Puerto Ricans living on the U.S. mainland continued providing financial support. They hosted displaced family members and advocated for federal aid. As my co-author Maura I. Toro-Morn and I document in our book <a href=\"https://www.siupress.com/9780809338160/puerto-ricans-in-illinois/\">“Puerto Ricans in Illinois,”</a> diaspora communities that mobilized statewide in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria demonstrated how Puerto Ricans supported the island during crisis.</p>\n\n<p>The Jamaican diaspora in London, Toronto, New York and Miami represents a massive potential resource for both immediate relief and long-term recovery.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A map shows where millions of Jamaicans live overseas, led by the U.S. (1.1 million), United Kingdom (400,000) and Canada (300,000).\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=633&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=633&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=633&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=796&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=796&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699507/original/file-20251030-64-k6nefp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=796&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Where Jamaicans lived outside their homeland in the early 2020s.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jamaican_diaspora.jpg\">Maps Interlude/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the hours after Melissa made landfall, these communities were already trying to reach family members and organize help.

In Connecticut, Caribbean social groups <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/connecticut-residents-keeping-relatives-jamaica-204719454.html\">were gathering their communities to send support</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Jamaica’s government has multiple diaspora engagement platforms, such as <a href=\"https://jadiasporaengage.mfaft.gov.jm/\">JA Diaspora Engage</a>, the <a href=\"https://mfaft.gov.jm/site/the-global-jamaica-diaspora-council/\">Global Jamaica Diaspora Council</a> and <a href=\"https://dobusinessjamaica.com/\">JAMPRO</a>. But these primarily focus on economic development and investment rather than disaster response coordination. In contrast, Haiti established the <a href=\"https://haitirenew.org/hderu-deactivation/\">Haitian Diaspora Emergency Response Unit</a> in 2010 specifically for disaster coordination.

It could provide regular updates on community needs during disasters, verify trusted local partners for aid distribution, and facilitate logistics for shipping supplies over the years of recovery.</p>\n\n<h2>The out-migration risk: When emergencies becomes permanent</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most devastating long-term impact of Hurricane María was massive population loss — a recovery failure that began with emergency response decisions. </p>\n\n<p>Of Puerto Ricans who applied for federal assistance, <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2595.html\">approximately 50% had new addresses on the U.S. mainland</a>. Their displacement that began as a temporary evacuation became permanent when Puerto Rico couldn’t restore viable living conditions quickly enough.</p>\n\n<p>Without housing, employment or basic services for months, families had little choice but to leave. About a <a href=\"https://luminafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/school-closure-in-puerto-rico.pdf\">quarter of Puerto Rico’s schools were closed</a> by the storm damage. I saw <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/maui-wildfires-extra-logistical-challenges-hinder-governments-initial-response-when-disasters-strike-islands-211384\">similar patterns in Maui, Hawaii</a>, as it recovered from devastating wildfires in 2023. Limited lodging and high costs made it impossible for many displaced residents to stay. </p>\n\n<p>Researchers estimated that of the nearly 400,000 people who left Puerto Rico in 2017 and 2018 after María, maybe <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-020-00356-4\">50,000 had returned by 2019</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Jamaica faces similar risks. The out-migration crisis doesn’t happen all at once – it’s a slow bleed that accelerates as emergency response transitions into prolonged recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The time to prevent that pressure to leave is now. The government can help by communicating realistic timelines for service restoration and prioritizing school reopening. Every week increases the risk that temporary displacement becomes permanent emigration.</p>\n\n<h2>Building back better: Recovery, not just response</h2>\n\n<p>Disasters create opportunities to build back better, but that requires <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17020482\">thinking about the future</a> rather than simply recreating what existed before.</p>\n\n<p>Jamaica can prioritize speed in emergency response by rebuilding the old system, or it can invest in a recovery that also builds resilience for the future. Climate change is fueling more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920849117\">intense and destructive hurricanes</a>, leaving Caribbean islands at growing risk of damage.</p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Maria revealed serious infrastructure vulnerabilities as <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8644031/\">the aging power grid collapsed under Category 4 winds</a>. Puerto Rico could have been rebuilt with more modern, resilient infrastructure. However, decisions in Washington and Puerto Rico pointed it in a different direction. RAND Corporation research found that reconstruction largely <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2595.html\">restored the old, vulnerable centralized power system</a>, rather than transforming it with distributed renewable energy, hardened transmission lines and microgrids that could withstand future storms.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Solar panels on roofs and apartment balconies\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699590/original/file-20251030-56-j8r3fh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many businesses and homeowners in Puerto Rico added solar panels after Hurricane Maria to help manage frequent power grid outages.

Californians will decide whether to approve those changes <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=50&amp;year=2025\">in a ballot measure on Nov. 4, 2025</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>As other states join the fray, this battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives has escalated to what the media has called a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/08/16/us/politics/texas-california-redistricting-republicans-democrats.html?unlocked_article_code=1.xE8.cOM8.dC_PIDsPdO6d&amp;smid=url-share\">Redistricting War</a>.” In this war, the control of the House may be determined more by how each party is able to redistrict states they control and less by how citizens vote. </p>\n\n<p>The media and politicians focus on which party is winning or losing seats. But are the citizens winning or losing in this conflict?</p>\n\n<p>Studies have shown that districts contorted for political purposes make it more difficult for constituents to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1065912908330728\">know who their representatives are</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12883\">reduces representative-citizen interactions</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00546.x\">lowers voter participation in elections</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Changing a resident’s congressional district will sever any existing relationship or understanding of who their current representative is and how to seek help or share policy concerns. This forces residents to navigate unfamiliar political terrain as they figure out their new district, who is running, and what the candidates stand for. This added complexity discourages residents from voting.  </p>\n\n<p>More importantly, it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1532673X251352552\">diminishes their faith in the democratic process</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two people with question mark bubbles over their heads.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=469&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699504/original/file-20251030-56-fspsde.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=589&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Districts being contorted for political purposes makes it more difficult for constituents to know who their representatives are and lowers voter participation in elections.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/gerrymander-icon-style-royalty-free-illustration/2200321518?phrase=gerrymander&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Circlon Tech/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Staggering scale of changes</h2>\n\n<p>Just how big are the changes already enacted in Texas and proposed in California?</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://geography.richmond.edu/spatial-analysis-lab/\">University of Richmond Spatial Analysis Laboratory</a>, which co-author <a href=\"https://geography.richmond.edu/faculty/kredican/\">Kyle Redican</a> directs, has analyzed the impact of the mid-decade redistricting changes. The number of redistricting casualties – residents reassigned to a new congressional district – caused by these mid-decade changes in Texas and California is nearly 20 million. That’s about 6% of the overall U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p>The scale of the changes is staggering: 10.4 million Texas residents, about 36% of the state’s population, and 9.2 million California residents, about 23% of the state’s population, will find themselves in new, unfamiliar congressional districts. </p>\n\n<p>Only one district in Texas, of 38 total districts, and eight districts in California, of 52 total districts, remain untouched, making this a pervasive upheaval, not a surgical adjustment.  </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"6XvWt\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6XvWt/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Most dramatically, nine districts in California and eight districts in Texas will have more than 50% new residents, fundamentally changing the overall composition of those districts. </p>\n\n<p>The 41st District in California will have 100% new residents, while the 9th District in Texas will have 97% new residents, essentially becoming entirely different constituencies. </p>\n\n<p>Making a change of this size mid-decade, as opposed to once every decade, will be highly disruptive and represent a major tear in the fabric of representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"QgXlj\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QgXlj/3/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Lawmakers picking their voters</h2>\n\n<p>So who exactly is being moved? The demographic patterns reveal the calculated nature of these partisan manipulations.</p>\n\n<p>In Texas, Black and Hispanic residents are disproportionately shuffled into new districts compared to white residents.  </p>\n\n<p>Minorities constitute 67.1% of Texans who have been moved into a new district, while minorities constitute only 56.4% of Texans who get to remain in their same district. By moving more minorities out of a district and into another reliably Republican district, partisan mapmakers are able to reduce the likely Democratic voter share in that district and swing it to be a Republican-leaning district.</p>\n\n<p>California follows the opposite playbook: White residents are disproportionately moved.  </p>\n\n<p>There, 41.2% of those moved into a new district are white, while only 32.7% of those who get to remain in their same district are white. In this case, California is moving likely Republican voters into another reliably Democratic district, which reduces the Republican voter share in the original district and swings it to be a Democratic-leaning district.</p>\n\n<p>In either case, legislators are making deliberate decisions about which residents to move to achieve a political goal. </p>\n\n<p>Yet fundamental to a representative democracy is a simple principle: The people choose their representatives. It’s not that representatives choose their constituents. The founders envisioned the House of Representatives as the people’s house, representing and accountable to the voters. </p>\n\n<p>In the current mid-decade redistricting, the legislators are handpicking their constituencies. </p>\n\n<h2>Mocking the fundamental idea</h2>\n\n<p>Does the redistricting battle ever end?  </p>\n\n<p>If mid-decade redistricting becomes an accepted way to win elections, each time a party wins control of a state legislature and governorship they will have the incentive to redistrict. Each of these future redistrictings will continue to negatively affect citizens’ participation in the representative process and mock the fundamental idea that citizens should choose their representatives. </p>\n\n<p>It’s entirely possible that redistricting could happen every two years – though that is an extreme outcome of this competition. </p>\n\n<p>Texas and California have fired the opening shots in the redistricting arms race. Other states – <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-war-over-us-congressional-redistricting-is-playing-out-state-by-state-2025-10-08/\">Missouri, North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/virginia-democrats-weigh-plan-counter-trumps-redistricting-campaign-2025-10-27/\">Virginia</a> – are joining the fight, each time diminishing the public trust in our democratic process. </p>\n\n<p>Today, it’s 20 million Americans caught in the crossfire. Tomorrow, it could be 100 million as this conflict spreads from state to state. With tit-for-tat redistricting offsetting gains in seats, who is really winning?  </p>\n\n<p>For sure, we know who is losing – the people and representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p><em>Spatial Analysis Lab intern Ryan Poulsen worked on the block data processing for this story.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268181/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This medication is the <a href=\"https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/\">No. 1-selling drug</a> in the U.S., with over 115 million prescriptions going to more than 29 million Americans. </p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/\">clinical pharmacologist and pharmacist</a> who has assessed the manufacturing quality of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626\">prescription</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280241233255\">over-the-counter</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/87551225251326811\">illicit drugs</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019900504\">dietary supplements</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This atorvastatin recall is large, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of patients. But it’s only the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-drug-loophole-sun-pharma\">series of concerning manufacturing issues</a> that have come to light since 2019.</p>\n\n<h2>What pills are being recalled, and why?</h2>\n\n<p>Ascend Laboratories, based in New Jersey, originally issued the recall for <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=97639\">about 142,000 bottles</a> of its generic atorvastatin on Sept. 19. Each bottle contained 90, 500 or 1,000 tablets, enough to fill prescriptions for three, 17 or 33 patients, respectively, for one month.</p>\n\n<p>About three weeks later, on Oct. 10, the FDA quantified the risk of using these poor-quality tablets and gave the recall a <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=97639\">Class II status</a>, which means that the medication could cause “<a href=\"https://pharmacyfreak.com/drug-recalls-in-the-usa-what-happens-when-the-fda-recalls-a-drug-understanding-class-i-ii-and-iii-recalls/\">temporary or medically reversible</a> adverse health consequences.” </p>\n\n<p>Manufacturers <a href=\"https://pharmaeducation.net/quality-control-tests-of-tablets-or-evaluation-of-tablets/\">must conduct quality tests</a> on random samples of tablets from every batch they make. These tests make sure the pills contain the correct dosage of the active ingredient, are made to the proper physical specifications and are not contaminated with heavy metals or microbes. If the samples test <a href=\"https://www.gmpsop.com/what-are-the-elements-of-quality-control-process-in-pharmaceuticals/\">“out of specification”</a> for any feature, the company must conduct further testing and destroy defective batches, losing the cost of manufacturing them.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, sample pills <a href=\"https://www.usp.org/sites/default/files/usp/document/harmonization/gen-method/stage_6_monograph_25_feb_2011.pdf\">failed to dissolve properly</a> when they were tested.

It then goes to the liver, where it reduces the blood concentrations of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028017722009\">low-density lipoproteins</a> – also called LDL, or “bad cholesterol.” </p>\n\n<p>If the drug doesn’t dissolve properly, the amount absorbed by the body is substantially reduced.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa050461\">Lowering LDL with atorvastatin</a> has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes after a few years by 22%.

Even if you have the recalled pills, taking them is still better than not taking the medicine at all. </p>\n\n<p>You can determine whether your medication came from Ascend Laboratories by looking at your prescription label. </p>\n\n<p>Search for the abbreviations <a href=\"https://www.printablelabeltemplates.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/prescription-label-template-microsoft-word-prescription-label-template-best-business-template-within-prescription-label-template-RfKgMc.jpg\">MFG or MFR</a>, which stand for “manufacturing” or “manufacturer.” If it says “MFG Ascend” or “MFR Ascend,” that means that Ascend Laboratories supplied the medication. </p>\n\n<p>The first five letters of a National Drug Code, abbreviated as NDC on the prescription label, also reveal the manufacturer or distributor. <a href=\"https://ndclist.com/ndc/67877-513/package/67877-513-10\">Ascend products have the number 67877</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If Ascend Laboratories is the distributor, a pharmacist can cross-reference your prescription number to obtain the lot number and compare it with the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=97639\">posted lot numbers</a> on the FDA website for recalled atorvastatin. If your product has been recalled, your pharmacy may have other generic versions of atorvastatin in stock that are not part of this recall.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Woman examining a medicine bottle\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699321/original/file-20251029-56-15k73n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">You should be able to tell from the prescription label whether your atorvastatin comes from the manufacturer that announced the recall.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/elderly-woman-examining-a-medicine-bottle-in-a-royalty-free-image/2194995487\">benixs/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the pharmacist can get a new prescription from your health care provider for another <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/009127000204200902\">generic statin drug, such as rosuvastatin</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.pharmacypracticenews.com/Clinical/Article/06-22/Using-National-Guidelines-to-Determine-Hyperlipidemia-Treatment/67209\">works similarly</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A pattern of lapses for overseas manufacturers</h2>\n\n<p>While the defective atorvastatin is distributed by a U.S. company, it is actually manufactured by <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=97639\">Alkem Laboratories in India</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, many aspects of pharmaceutical drug manufacturing are now occurring overseas, primarily in China and India. This has limited the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019881692\">FDA’s ability to provide the oversight</a> required for drugs sold in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, the FDA <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019881692\">performed routine surveillance inspections</a>  of U.S. manufacturing plants every three years, but seldom conducted them overseas. In the wake of several high-profile manufacturing quality lapses, including at <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/generic-drug-manufacturer-ranbaxy-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-to-pay-500-million-to-resolve-false-claims-allegations-cgmp-violations-and-false-statements-to-the-fda/\">the Indian generic drug giant Ranbaxy Laboratories</a>, Congress <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-track-agency-wide-program-performance/fda-track-generic-drug-user-fee-amendments-gdufa-performance-reports\">established a funding mechanism</a> and the FDA established a universal standard for inspecting both U.S. and overseas manufacturers every five years. </p>\n\n<p>However, the U.S. fell behind with international inspections after COVID-19 shut down international travel, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626\">it has yet to catch up</a>. Additionally, overseas manufacturers generally get warning of an upcoming inspection, making the process potentially less rigorous than in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>A lack of inspections for eye drop manufacturers, especially in India, led to massive recalls in 2023 after a wave of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280241233255\">rare eye infections</a> caused some people to lose their eyesight. The problem was traced to widespread unsanitary manufacturing conditions and improper testing for sterility at overseas facilities.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/fdageneral/114762\">eight deaths and multiple hospitalizations</a> led an Indian manufacturer, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, to recall 47 million potassium chloride extended-release capsules that did not dissolve properly. In February 2025, inspectors found that the company had falsified quality results.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA recently started <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626\">laboratory spot testing</a> of prescription and over-the-counter drugs arriving in the U.S. to compensate for these limitations. Outside laboratories such as <a href=\"https://www.valisure.com/\">Valisure</a> also do independent testing. Independent testing has caught several dangerous products, but due to limited resources, only a few products can be tested each year.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, Alkem Laboratories, which manufactured the currently recalled atorvastatin, had to recall 58,000 bottles of the blood pressure drug <a href=\"https://www.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com/site/pln/news/beta-blocker-recalled-1\">metoprolol XL</a> because the pills also did not properly dissolve. Spot testing also led to widespread recalls after FDA and Valisure laboratories found cancer-causing chemicals called nitrosamines in some <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019892222\">blood pressure, diabetes</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.10043\">indigestion drugs</a> tested between 2019 and 2020, as well as benzene in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626\">numerous sunscreen and antibacterial gel products</a> tested between 2020 and early 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>Raising consumer vigilance</h2>\n\n<p>With these growing gaps in oversight, it’s reasonable to be mindful of changes in how a particular medication affects you. If your prescription drug suddenly stops working, it might be because that particular batch of the medication was not manufactured properly. Alerting the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/medwatch-forms-fda-safety-reporting\">about sudden loss of drug effectiveness</a> could help the agency more quickly identify manufacturing issues.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, the FDA started <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/partners-networks/international-activities/bilateral-interactions-non-eu-regulators/united-states\">sharing the inspection burden</a> with other regulatory agencies like the European Medicines Agency for the European Union. Such coordinated efforts could lead to less duplication and a bump in inspections of overseas manufacturers. </p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, however, consumers are largely at the mercy of spotty inspections and testing, and rarely hear about problems unless poorly manufactured drugs cause widespread adverse events.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268364/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>C.

My gender is ‘none.’”</p>\n\n<p>Manisha’s response didn’t shock me. In my <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f38OaaIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">work as a sociologist</a>, I had been interviewing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.13240\">asexual individuals</a> – people who experience low to no sexual attraction – across the United States for months from 2020 to 2021. Like Manisha, more than a third of the 77 people I talked to were uncomfortable with defining themselves through the lens of gender. Gender was, as I came to describe it, detached from their sense of self.</p>\n\n<p>This finding comes at a tumultuous time in the politics of gender. On the one hand, transgender and queer social movements have sought to <a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/whos-afraid-of-social-contagion/\">expand people’s ability</a> to break out of the gender binary of man or woman. On the other, the Trump administration has aggressively worked to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/6-ways-trumps-executive-orders-are-targeting-transgender-people\">reassert the gender binary</a> by law.</p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251339382\">recently published research</a>, I draw on interviews with 30 asexual people who, like Manisha, felt uncomfortable adopting any gender identity. These individuals said they felt that gender was irrelevant, unimportant, pointless and, overall, not a helpful framework for understanding and defining themselves.</p>\n\n<p>These feelings of not identifying with gender highlight an unexpected belief shared by conservative politicians and by many within transgender and queer communities: the assumption that everyone has a gender identity.</p>\n\n<h2>Gender detachment</h2>\n\n<p>During this research, I spoke with asexual people from a variety of backgrounds across the U.S., ranging from ages 18 to 50. When I began, I planned on comparing the gendered experiences of three groups: asexual men, asexual women and nonbinary asexuals. I quickly had to abandon that plan as I repeatedly encountered interviewees who did not fit into any gender category.</p>\n\n<p>Ollia was the first person who struck me as impossible to assign a gender to. “My gender is like an empty lot: There may have been a building there at some point, but it’s long since fallen away, and there’s no need to rebuild it,” they explained. “The space is better for being left empty.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Gender neutral bathroom sign attached to wall\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697900/original/file-20251022-56-ty492p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Some people don’t consider gender a part of their sense of self.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/genderless-public-restroom-sign-royalty-free-image/1390452606\">AndreyPopov/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Many struggled to explain this sense that they did not truly have a gender identity. “There really isn’t a specific term that can be used to describe how uninterested I am in the concept of gender as a whole,” said a respondent named Faye. </p>\n\n<p>Faced with a language vacuum, I eventually coined a term to describe these distant and skeptical relationships with gender: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251339382\">gender detachment</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Compulsory gender</h2>\n\n<p>Gender detachment might sound similar to <a href=\"https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Agender\">being agender</a> – that is, not having a gender. Researchers often see agender as a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12517\">subset of nonbinary</a>. However, most respondents drew a distinction between gender detachment and being agender or nonbinary. </p>\n\n<p>For example, when I initially asked Brandy about their gender identity, they said they were agender. When I asked how accurate that label felt, however, Brandy explained that the term ultimately felt incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>“A lot of people see gender as a spectrum from pink to purple to blue … and I’m a splotch of green on the frame,” Brandy explained. “I just don’t see myself in that spectrum. While agender and nonbinary are handy terms, they still work within a gendered framework I don’t place myself in.”</p>\n\n<p>Brandy quietly pointed out something I found profound: The assumption that everyone has a gender is so omnipresent that even the sense that you do not have a gender has been turned into a gender identity – agender.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, gender detachment poses a significant challenge to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251339382\">how people often think about gender</a> – namely, the assumption that everyone has a gender identity. Gender detachment isn’t just about not identifying as a man or a woman; it’s about not identifying with gender at all.</p>\n\n<p>Sociologists broadly agree that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76333-0_2\">gender is a social construct</a>, meaning its definition, norms, behaviors and roles are created and shaped by society, not by biology. This perspective implicitly understands gender categories to also be concepts created and shaped by cultural norms.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816624416/invention-of-women/\">Western societies</a> generally assume that everyone does – and should – have a gender identity. But what people who experience gender detachment show is that the very system of gender categorization is itself a social construct: an idea based on cultural norms rather than in empirical reality. I call this assumption <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251339382\">compulsory gender</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C110%2C2121%2C1193&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration of overlapping, multicolored silhouettes of human figures\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C110%2C2121%2C1193&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697899/original/file-20251022-64-3104f6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Gender is highly individual yet also shaped by culture and society.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/geometric-illustration-of-multi-coloured-royalty-free-illustration/1357830750\">ajijchan/iStock/Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Resisting compulsory categorization</h2>\n\n<p>Gender detachment represents a way people are resisting gender as a compulsory system of categorization. </p>\n\n<p>Asexual people are uniquely positioned to question conventions surrounding gender. Asexuality upends the belief that everyone experiences sexual attraction – an assumption often called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.51681/1.1113\">compulsory sexuality</a>. It made sense to me that as asexual people begin questioning the universality of sexuality, some might also being to question the universality of gender. As compulsory sexuality crumbles, so does compulsory gender.</p>\n\n<p>Sociologists often reinforce compulsory gender in how they <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231251339382\">measure and ask questions about gender</a>. Indeed, that was initially the case for my own study. In each interview, I asked respondents about their gender identity. Almost all gave one. It was only when I asked them about their feelings about gender that I realized the identity they gave me did not feel entirely accurate to them. Rather, they felt detached from gender overall. My findings suggest that going beyond simply asking respondents to report their gender could help researchers better understand how people feel about the very concept of having a gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>One way of understanding the current <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.16995/tsi.18211\">gender tug-of-war in U.S. culture</a> is as a struggle over what gender identities people are allowed to claim. One camp seeks to expand how many gender identities are available and allow people to choose what resonates most with them. The other camp seeks to obligate people to identify solely within a gender binary of man or woman. </p>\n\n<p>My findings on gender detachment suggest that despite their consequential differences, both camps reinforce compulsory gender by assuming gender is a universal element of who people are.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267286/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Canton Winer does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "content": "<p>A new, old specter is haunting the world: the bloodthirsty Anglo-Saxons.</p>\n\n<p>Well, that is what the Kremlin wants the world to believe.</p>\n\n<p>Take the new Russian <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/kremlin-anti-west-propaganda-film-195948550.html\">state-backed film “Tolerance</a>.” Released in September 2025 to a <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/10/04/the-terror-of-tolerance\">less than enthusiastic public response</a>, the dystopian tale of moral decay in the West opens with a warning of an “omnipresent Anglo-Saxon liberalism” that will “cause the ultimate degradation and extinction of once-prosperous countries and peoples.”</p>\n\n<p>Scary stuff. But the film isn’t the first time that Anglo-Saxons have been cited as a threat to the Russian way of life.</p>\n\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine\">full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a> in February 2022, Russian officials and their colleagues in the Kremlin-controlled media have taken to referring to their Western adversaries as “Anglo-Saxons.” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov even stated that the “Anglo-Saxons” in question are bent on defeating Russia “with the hands of the <a href=\"https://tass.ru/politika/22307123\">Kyiv regime</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, analysis one of us conducted with Adrian Rogstad at the University of Groningen looking at statements posted on the Russian foreign ministry website found a marked increase in “Anglo-Saxon” references after the invasion of Ukraine – 86 of them in the course of 2022, compared to just 27 in the previous 20 years. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova’s <a href=\"https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1800451/\">March 2022 comment that</a> the “Anglo-Saxon world will never stop … It’s like an insatiable monster,” is typical of the way “Anglo-Saxon” is used. The term even made it into the official Russian <a href=\"https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/fundamental_documents/1860586/\">foreign policy concept published</a> a year later, where in the section titled “The U.S. and other Anglo-Saxon states,” the United States is referred to as “the main inspirer, organizer and executor of the aggressive anti-Russian policy of the collective West”.</p>\n\n<p>The term is a particular favorite of Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. In February 2024, Peskov <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/02/07/kremlin-says-putin-agreed-to-interview-with-tucker-carlson-because-he-differs-from-traditional-anglo-saxon-media\">explained that Putin</a> agreed to be interviewed by the right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson because he “stands in clear contrast to the position of the traditional Anglo-Saxon media.”</p>\n\n<p>This creeping use of “Anglo-Saxon” as a slur hasn’t gone unnoticed in the West. Former U.S. ambassador to Moscow Lynne Tracy <a href=\"https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/us-envoy-questions-russian-use-of-term-anglo-saxons/\">said in 2023 that the use of the term</a> was “very strange” given the multiethnic character of American society.</p>\n\n<p>Reports suggest that with the election of a more Russia-friendly president in Donald Trump, the word from the Kremlin was <a href=\"https://www.intellinews.com/russian-state-media-stops-calling-americans-anglo-saxons-after-kremlin-directive-370770/\">not to use the term for Americans</a>, specifically. But it appears not everyone got the memo – pro-Putin State Duma Deputy Viktor Vodolatsky recently <a href=\"https://arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=93911&amp;lang=3\">warned against “Anglo-Saxons” creating a “point of tension</a>” in the South Caucasus through the U.S.-led peace efforts between Azerbaijan and Armenia.</p>\n\n<p>As experts in <a href=\"https://www.rug.nl/staff/e.gaufman/?lang=en\">Russian discourse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wesleyan.edu/about/directory/profile.html?id=prutland\">post-Soviet nations</a>, we see the increased use of “Anglo-Saxons” as reflecting deeper trends that tap into Putin’s use of history to justify the invasion of Ukraine and smear his perceived enemies, while exploiting political divisions in Europe and America.</p>\n\n<h2>Who were the Anglo-Saxons?</h2>\n\n<p>The original Anglo-Saxons comprised the waves of conquerors from Germanic tribes in Europe that flooded into England – Jutes as well as Angles and Saxons – in the fifth and sixth centuries. Alfred the Great united the warring fiefdoms of southern England in the ninth century and declared himself king of the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3eXew91YDiAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Anglo-Saxon</a> realm. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A drawing of a man with a crown\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1013&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1013&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1013&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1273&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1273&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699205/original/file-20251029-66-cmwqn5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1273&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An 11th-century depiction of Alfred the Great.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alfred_the_Great_in_the_Brief_Abridgement_of_the_Chronicles_of_England.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>But the term <a href=\"https://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/anti-racism/misnaming-the-medieval-rejecting-anglo-saxon-studies/\">did not enter wider usage</a> until long after the “Anglo-Saxon period” ended with the invasion of England by French-speaking Normans in 1066. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, it wasn’t until the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century that <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-03208045/file/Louviot%20EMA%2095.pdf\">scholars started</a> to refer to the Anglo-Saxon origins of the English, in a bid to differentiate the country from Catholic Europe – another use of history for political aims.</p>\n\n<p>But the term really <a href=\"https://mrambaranolm.medium.com/history-bites-resources-on-the-problematic-term-anglo-saxon-part-1-9320b6a09eb7\">took off</a> in the 19th century, when it was folded into pseudoscientific racist justification for the British Empire. That came to an end in World War I, when Britain and America found themselves fighting against Germany – the location of Saxony. In 1917, the British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2017/jul/17/british-royal-family-windsor-name-change-1917\">royal family changed</a> their name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Even U.S. President Woodrow Wilson – an acknowledged racist – <a href=\"https://greatwarproject.org/2018/12/24/the-great-questions-emerge-who-won-the-war/\">insisted that Americans</a> were not Anglo-Saxons.</p>\n\n<p>There things stood until 1964, when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/20/us/e-digby-baltzell-dies-at-80-studied-wasp-s.html\">American professor E. Digby Baltzell</a> published “The Protestant Establishment,” which popularized the term “White Anglo Saxon Protestant,” or WASP, to refer to middle-class Americans of European descent. </p>\n\n<p>By the 2000s, it was mostly <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/old-english-serious-image-problem/\">white supremacists</a> who were using the term Anglo-Saxon as a synonym for a modern-day demographic. Academic <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/27596\">journals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/09/19/its-all-white-people-allegations-white-supremacy-are-tearing-apart-prestigious-medieval-studies-group/\">groups</a> dedicated to studying the Middle Ages dropped references to “Anglo-Saxons” due to the racist connotations.</p>\n\n<h2>Make Moscow medieval again!</h2>\n\n<p>It is against this background of Anglo-Saxon as a term appropriated by white supremacists that modern Russian usage should be seen.</p>\n\n<p>Russian propaganda has long sought to talk up the far right in Europe and America, with whom Putin’s “national conservatism” <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/politics/ideology-and-meaning-making-under-putin-regime\">has a close affinity</a>. It does so to <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2022/05/19/vlasti-vse-chasche-govoryat-chto-glavnye-vragi-rossii-eto-anglosaksy-eto-zhe-tolko-ssha-i-velikobritaniya-a-kak-zhe-kollektivnyy-zapad.\">sow division</a> in Western democracies and fracture the liberal international order. The aim is to portray the U.S. and U.K. as warmongering Anglo-Saxon nations, thereby encouraging the French, Germans and other Europeans to avoid following their lead. </p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the references to Anglo-Saxons reflects Russia’s view that global politics is driven by a “<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/russ.12105?casa_token=ifJgSnZit7QAAAAA%3Ahekeb25FgcWyB6OtnD2A1OL-Tv_97e2M0LT1eQUtDyVEQPyXc18DyBMYoRJoCc3z82dLAZfTb5YP62o\">clash of civilizations</a>,” in which Russia represents the values of traditional Europe, and it taps into a centuries-old fear of perfidious Western encroachment on the Russian state.</p>\n\n<p>It also fits a pattern of Putin <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/make-russia-medieval-again-how-putin-is-seeking-to-remold-society-with-a-little-help-from-ivan-the-terrible-253812\">referencing Russia’s medieval past</a> to explain the country’s current policies, even if he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/invoking-medieval-invaders-putin-rallies-russians-against-coronavirus-idUSKBN21Q1WI/\">needs the invasion of Turkic tribes</a> in the 11th century to justify COVID-19 measures.</p>\n\n<p>Putin has <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181\">tried to justify</a> the invasion of Ukraine by claiming that modern Russia is the direct descendant of ninth-century Kyivan Rus, and that Ukrainians are therefore really Russians. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian government has invested heavily in trying to <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/memory-makers-9781350280762/\">persuade its citizens</a> that they can trace their identity all the way back to a distant past in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/make-russia-medieval-again-how-putin-is-seeking-to-remold-society-with-a-little-help-from-ivan-the-terrible-253812\">medieval times</a> – at a time when Anglo-Saxons ruled England.</p>\n\n<p>But in leaning on outdated terminology popular with white supremacist groups in a bid to sow division and antagonism in the West, Putin seems to be retreating into an imaginary world of the medieval past.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264822/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

As a philosophy professor, I have a growing fear: When a polished essay no longer shows that a student did the thinking, the grade above it becomes hollow – and so does the diploma.</p>\n\n<p>The problem doesn’t stop in the classroom. In fields such as law, medicine and journalism, trust depends on knowing that human judgment guided the work. A patient, for instance, expects a doctor’s prescription to reflect an expert’s thought and training.</p>\n\n<p>AI products can now be used to support people’s decisions. But even when AI’s role in doing that type of work is small, you can’t be sure whether the professional drove the process or merely wrote a few prompts to do the job. What dissolves in this situation is accountability – the sense that institutions and individuals can answer for what they certify. And this comes at a time when <a href=\"https://www.pew.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2024/americans-deepening-mistrust-of-institutions\">public trust in civic institutions is already fraying</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I see education as the proving ground for a new challenge: learning to work with AI while preserving the integrity and visibility of human thinking. Crack the problem here, and a blueprint could emerge for other fields where trust depends on knowing that decisions still come from people. In my own classes, we’re testing an authorship protocol to ensure student writing stays connected to their thinking, even with AI in the loop.</p>\n\n<h2>When learning breaks down</h2>\n\n<p>The core exchange between teacher and student is under strain. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872\">recent MIT study</a> found that students using large language models to help with essays felt less ownership of their work and did worse on key writing‑related measures. </p>\n\n<p>Students still want to learn, but many feel defeated. They may ask: “Why think through it myself when AI can just tell me?” Teachers worry their feedback no longer lands. As one Columbia University sophomore told <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\">The New Yorker</a> after turning in her AI-assisted essay: “If they don’t like it, it wasn’t me who wrote it, you know?” </p>\n\n<p>Universities are scrambling. Some instructors are trying to <a href=\"https://tilt.colostate.edu/how-do-i-ai-proof-my-assignments/\">make assignments “AI-proof</a>,” switching to personal reflections or requiring students to include their prompts and process. Over the past two years, I’ve tried versions of these in my own classes, even asking students to invent new formats. But AI can mimic almost any task or style.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-left zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"College student working in class\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=894&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=894&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=894&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1123&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1123&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698766/original/file-20251027-76-1y36e0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1123&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">In-class assignments on paper can get around student dependence on AI chatbots.

Yet those mostly reward speed under pressure, not reflection. And if students use AI outside class for assignments, teachers will simply lower the bar for quality, much as they did when <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36256-4\">smartphones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5571050/social-media-teens-brains-reading-memory\">social media</a> began to erode sustained reading and attention.</p>\n\n<p>Many institutions resort to sweeping bans or hand the problem to <a href=\"https://academictech.uchicago.edu/detection-software/\">ed-tech firms</a>, whose detectors log every keystroke and replay drafts like movies. Teachers sift through forensic timelines; students feel surveilled. Too useful to ban, AI slips underground like contraband.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge isn’t that AI makes strong arguments available; books and peers do that, too. What’s different is that AI seeps into the environment, constantly whispering suggestions into the student’s ear. Whether the student merely echoes these or works them into their own reasoning is crucial, but teachers cannot assess that after the fact. A strong paper may hide dependence, while a weak one may reflect real struggle.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, other signatures of a students’ reasoning – awkward phrasings that improve over the course of a paper, the quality of citations, general fluency of the writing – are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03046-z\">obscured by AI</a> as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Restoring the link between process and product</h2>\n\n<p>Though many would happily skip the effort of thinking for themselves, it’s what makes <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-does-ai-affect-how-we-learn-a-cognitive-psychologist-explains-why-you-learn-when-the-work-is-hard-262863\">learning durable</a> and prepares students to become responsible professionals and leaders. Even if handing control to AI were desirable, it can’t be held accountable, and its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/suicide-by-chatbot-puts-big-tech-in-the-product-liability-hot-seat-265550\">makers don’t want that role</a>. The only option as I see it is to protect the link between a student’s reasoning and the work that builds it.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a classroom platform where teachers set the rules for each assignment, choosing how AI can be used. A philosophy essay might run in AI-free mode – students write in a window that disables copy-paste and external AI calls but still lets them save drafts. A coding project might allow AI assistance but pause before submission to ask the student brief questions about how their code works. When the work is sent to the teacher, the system issues a secure receipt – a digital tag, like a sealed exam envelope – confirming that it was produced under those specified conditions.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t detection: no algorithm scanning for AI markers. And it isn’t surveillance: no keystroke logging or draft spying. The assignment’s AI terms are built into the submission process. Work that doesn’t meet those conditions simply won’t go through, like when a platform rejects an unsupported file type.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/cilab/\">my lab at Temple University</a>, we’re piloting this approach by using the authorship protocol I’ve developed. In the main authorship check mode, an AI assistant poses brief, conversational questions that draw students back into their thinking: “Could you restate your main point more clearly?” or “Is there a better example that shows the same idea?” Their short, in-the-moment responses and edits allow the system to measure how well their reasoning and final draft align.</p>\n\n<p>The prompts adapt in real time to each student’s writing, with the intent of making the cost of cheating higher than the effort of thinking. The goal isn’t to grade or replace teachers but to reconnect the work students turn in with the reasoning that produced it. For teachers, this restores confidence that their feedback lands on a student’s actual reasoning. For students, it builds <a href=\"https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2024/5/23-1\">metacognitive awareness</a>, helping them see when they’re genuinely thinking and when they’re merely offloading. </p>\n\n<p>I believe teachers and researchers should be able to design their own authorship checks, each issuing a secure tag that certifies the work passed through their chosen process, one that institutions can then decide to trust and adopt.</p>\n\n<h2>How humans and intelligent machines interact</h2>\n\n<p>There are related efforts underway outside education. In publishing, <a href=\"https://authorsguild.org/human-authored/\">certification efforts</a> already experiment with “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/15/books-by-people-for-people-publishers-launch-certification-human-written-ai\">human-written” stamps</a>. Yet without reliable verification, such labels collapse into marketing claims. What needs to be verified isn’t keystrokes but how people engage with their work.</p>\n\n<p>That shifts the question to cognitive authorship: not whether or how much AI was used, but how its integration affects ownership and reflection. As <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/29/if-ai-can-diagnose-patients-what-are-doctors-for\">one doctor</a> recently observed, learning how to deploy AI in the medical field will require a science of its own. The same holds for any field that depends on human judgment. </p>\n\n<p>I see this protocol acting as an interaction layer with verification tags that travel with the work wherever it goes, like email moving between providers. It would complement technical standards for verifying <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential\">digital identity</a> and <a href=\"https://c2pa.org\">content provenance</a> that already exist. The key difference is existing protocols certify the artifact, not the human judgment behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Without giving professions control over how AI is used and ensuring the place of human judgment in AI-assisted work, AI technology risks dissolving the trust on which professions and civic institutions depend. AI is not just a tool; it is a cognitive environment reshaping how we think. To inhabit this environment on our own terms, we must build open systems that keep human judgment at the center.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266132/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Eli Alshanetsky does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The comments can be laced with insult, character attack and invective.</p>\n\n<p>I’m certainly not the only one noticing this kind of vitriolic polarization. Recent polling suggests a majority of Americans believe that the country <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/times-siena-poll-political-polarization.html\">cannot overcome its current divisions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=64GwCx0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">professor of human development and family studies</a>, I’ve researched and written about traumatic and adverse childhood experiences and existential anxiety for over 20 years. Scrolling through my feed, I was struck by the recognition that both sides had something in common: a profound sense of existential fear.</p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116950118\">political polarization</a> has many potential causes, existential anxiety is one that has received less attention.</p>\n\n<h2>What is existential anxiety?</h2>\n\n<p>Philosophers have written about the concept of existential anxiety for centuries. My own empirical research is based on the <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300188790/the-courage-to-be/\">writings of the mid-20th century philosopher Paul Tillich</a>, who outlines three facets of this fundamental human fear:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fate and death – fears of nonexistence and uncertainty about one’s ultimate destiny.</li>\n<li>Emptiness and meaninglessness – fears about life’s deeper purpose or ultimate concern.</li>\n<li>Guilt and condemnation – fears of moral failure or threats to one’s ethical self.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Existential anxiety is humanity’s inherent confrontation with mortality, moral responsibility and search for meaning.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I have found that these fears are very common – between 75% and 86% of participants in our research <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10615800412331318616\">endorsing at least one concern</a>. Higher levels of existential anxiety are associated with indicators of poor mental health, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022167812449190\">symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation</a>. Existential anxiety levels are also elevated among those who have experienced a life-threatening event. For instance, after surviving a natural disaster, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22128\">up to 94% of research participants</a> reported at least one dimension of this fear.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, our research suggests that existential anxiety is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15283488.2013.780975\">associated with aggression</a>. In one study of teens, we found that more extreme existential anxiety as measured with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.34448.62726\">existential anxiety questionnaire</a> was associated with two kinds of aggression: proactive and reactive. Proactive aggression is goal driven, deliberate and unprovoked, while reactive aggression comes in response to a real or perceived provocation or threat.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"blue and red figurines lean toward each other with spiky matching speech bubbles\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699313/original/file-20251029-56-d4vbmy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Even the most extreme opposite positions likely share a common root: a threat that triggers existential anxiety.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/wooden-figurines-arguing-royalty-free-image/1300154639\">PM Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Underlying theme in existential anxiety</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1628080\">Existential fears</a> have their roots in things that pretty much everyone worries about, at least from time to time. But what specifically triggers this anxiety can be different depending on your worldview.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, as I scroll social media, I see friends expressing anxiety about fundamental safety issues, the fate of the nation, cultural erosion and the loss of traditional values. These concerns are mirrored by other friends’ posts expressing concern that the environment is being destroyed, democracy is failing and equality is lost.</p>\n\n<p>Though the content of these expressions can be ideologically opposed, each reflects deeper concerns about societal fate, death or the end of a meaningful way of life. Unspoken but underlying is the fear that the “other side” represents a real and impending threat to one’s very existence.</p>\n\n<p>Though the triggering circumstances can differ based on personal beliefs, both sides’ perspectives reflect existential concerns about meaning, moral direction and survival.</p>\n\n<p>But existential anxiety isn’t just the likely root of some of this distress. Research suggests that underlying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00049\">fear can increase aggression</a>. Left unchecked, fears may <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/15248380241266206\">spiral into potential violence</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"a hand reaches out of the water with circular ripples around\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699314/original/file-20251029-56-kdr45b.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">While existential fears are a part of life, there are ways to pull yourself out of their spiral.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/drowning-person-royalty-free-image/1173642967\">mrs/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Where do we go?</h2>\n\n<p>The good news is that while core existential fears may never fully abate, you can identify them, alleviate them and possibly even channel them toward adaptive action.</p>\n\n<p>The techniques of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/9780197768075.003.0010\">cognitive behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy</a> provide a path toward finding common ground and preventing existential fears from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605251368854\">escalating into violence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Core to these techniques is recognizing and facing the fear. They both help participants overcome common tendencies such as seeing only one side of the evidence or catastrophizing that things are much worse than they really are. Acceptance and commitment therapy, for example, teaches participants how to cultivate psychological flexibility, learn to tolerate uncomfortable thoughts or emotions, and practice acting in alignment with one’s core values. Together, these skills foster positive action as opposed to destructive reaction.</p>\n\n<p>As disturbing as my social media feed can be, I’ve also seen real-world instances of people figuring out how to connect across a divide. For instance, one poster appreciated another’s comment for helping her realize the existential value his perspective represented to him. Following that exchange, the second poster acknowledged he’d been seeing only one side. In other words, they each recognized the other person’s existential fear – accepting it as such helped them de-escalate the confrontation and move forward more constructively.</p>\n\n<p>The critical point is that people on all sides of every issue yearn for safety, purpose and belonging. Recognizing that the core existential concerns we all share underlie polarized fears might be an important step toward <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01442-3\">bridging divides</a> and reducing the risk of fear-driven aggression.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266551/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Carl F.

In fact, tardigrades are the only known animal to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/167642\">survive in outer space</a>. They can also endure radiation levels <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09553000600972956\">up to 2,000 times higher</a> than what human cells can tolerate. Naturally, scientists have long wondered: How do they do it?</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, researchers uncovered one of the tardigrade’s secrets: a gene with a sequence unlike any other known to exist in nature that makes a protein found only in tardigrades. When they introduced this protein into human cells, those cells also became more resistant to radiation. The protein was named <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12808\">damage suppressor, or Dsup</a>, because it helps protect DNA – the blueprint for life – from damage.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, researchers around the world have been trying to figure out exactly how Dsup works. As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6KUpdAMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">biochemist studying Dsup</a>, my goal is to uncover how this protein functions and one day use these insights to design new therapies that protect human cells from DNA damage.</p>\n\n<h2>How Dsup protects tardigrade DNA</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists have proposed several explanations for Dsup’s remarkable ability to protect DNA from radiation. However, these models have varying levels of experimental support, and no single explanation has gained broad consensus from the field. </p>\n\n<p>In my recent work, I found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2025.169490\">Dsup interacts strongly with DNA</a>. It clings tightly to DNA – not just at one spot of the molecule but along its entirety. Dsup doesn’t have a fixed shape. Instead, it behaves more like a spaghetti noodle in water, constantly shifting, bending and adopting many different shapes. When it binds to DNA, it causes the strands to slightly unwind, like a zipper being loosened. This gentle unwinding may make DNA less susceptible to damage when exposed to radiation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Long kinked molecule, colored rainbow\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=255&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=255&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=255&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=321&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=321&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699223/original/file-20251029-56-sx9j1g.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=321&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Structural snapshot of Dsup.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Tyler Woodward</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Some scientists instead believe Dsup acts like a shield. In this model, Dsup coats and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12808\">physically blocks radiation</a> from striking DNA. Others think it <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10100970\">boosts the cell’s repair machinery</a>, fixing damage before it causes detrimental effects. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, it’s possible many of these models could be true at the same time. Since Dsup <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad066\">protects against many types of radiation</a> – as well as the toxic byproducts created from radiation damage – it’s likely this mysterious protein has multiple functions. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding Dsup could one day help people better protect their own cells – bringing a bit of the tardigrade’s extraordinary resilience to human health.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Dsup to advance medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists are exploring whether Dsup could be used in medicine, especially in diseases where DNA damage plays a major role. </p>\n\n<p>Because nearly all cancers involve DNA damage, some researchers think Dsup – or treatments inspired by it – could one day help prevent cells from turning cancerous. It might also <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/tiny-tardigrades-may-hold-clues-cancer-care\">protect healthy tissue during cancer treatments</a> such as radiation or chemotherapy, which work by damaging DNA but often harm healthy cells in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Dsup’s potential in human health extends much further. For instance, during heart attacks or strokes, organ tissues experience bursts of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22083838\">oxidative stress</a> – chemical reactions that lead to extensive DNA damage. This oxidative stress can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox14010038\">worsen disease severity</a> and long-term outcomes for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. If Dsup can protect DNA during these stressful events, it might be able to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10100970\">reduce the cellular damage they cause</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Early animal studies are already showing promising results, demonstrating that mammals can produce Dsup, eliciting similar effects. In one study, scientists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5\">used an injection of mRNA</a> – similar to the technology behind COVID-19 mRNA vaccines – to deliver the genetic instructions to produce Dsup in mice. When the mice were later exposed to high doses of radiation, those producing Dsup had far less DNA damage than untreated mice, suggesting real protective power in living organisms.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Microscopy image of a translucent creature with a rounded head and oval body\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698981/original/file-20251028-66-ozo380.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Tardigrades are the epitome of small yet mighty.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mikrofoto.de-Baertierchen5.jpg\">Frank Fox/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Dsup in agriculture, space and more</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond medicine, Dsup could make an impact in agriculture, space exploration and even data storage. </p>\n\n<p>When researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.108184\">engineered rice</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13100840\">and tobacco plants</a> to produce Dsup, the plants became more resistant to radiation – an exciting sign for Dsup’s potential to mitigate crop damage. </p>\n\n<p>In space biology, Dsup could help astronauts <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-how-water-bear-genes-could-protect-space-explorers-radiation-180960547/\">withstand the intense cosmic radiation</a> that limits long-term missions. </p>\n\n<p>And in a futuristic twist, some scientists are investigating how creatures like tardigrades could be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202206201\">used for ultrastable data storage</a>. Current digital media is susceptible to damage from environmental conditions such as high temperatures or high levels of radiation. Digital media could be converted into a DNA sequence and genetically engineered into the tardigrade genome. Dsup could then aid in protecting the data from extreme conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next for Dsup?</h2>\n\n<p>Since its discovery nearly a decade ago, the scientific community has been excited about the potential technological advancements that Dsup could enable. However, significant research is still required to fully understand exactly how this mysterious protein functions in living organisms. Several scientific groups around the world are actively <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114063\">studying the unique properties of this protein</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the work ahead, the story of Dsup demonstrates how scientists can learn lessons from tiny animals such as tardigrades. By studying the molecular mysteries of these remarkably resilient creatures, researchers are creating breakthrough tools to combat human disease and advance biotechnology.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268057/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tyler J.

Earth’s orbital area is often considered to extend from near Earth out to <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Education/3._The_geostationary_orbit\">geostationary orbit</a>, where a spacecraft orbits at a speed that makes it appear stationary from the Earth’s surface. </p>\n\n<p>Cislunar space extends from geostationary orbit out to the Moon – an area with a volume 2,000 times larger than Earth’s orbital area.

In 2023, the Indian Space Research Organization reported it had maneuvered its Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft three times in four years, even though <a href=\"https://www.isro.gov.in/Current_Space_Situation_around_Moon_Assessment.html\">only six spacecraft orbited the Moon in that time</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Better monitoring and coordination between different space agencies could prevent congestion and keep countries from having to regularly move their spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Monitoring cislunar space is not just important for safety – it can also help support national security. Multiple countries have <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025\">weapons that can destroy satellites</a>, and some in the space community are concerned that space weapons could be placed in cislunar space to escape detection. The <a href=\"https://www.space.com/military-interest-moon-cislunar-space\">U.S. Space Force is considering</a> the potential security dimensions of cislunar space. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. currently has significant gaps in its ability to monitor this region, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2023.101548\">Mariel’s research</a> suggests that developing this capability – referred to as cislunar space domain awareness – should be a priority for national security. Improved monitoring would help the U.S. military observe activity in cislunar space, gather intelligence and assess potential threats.</p>\n\n<h2>Solutions in progress</h2>\n\n<p>Several research programs are experimenting in this area. The Air Force Research Laboratory is funding a <a href=\"https://afresearchlab.com/technology/oracle/\">program called Oracle</a> that is developing multiple systems to improve the U.S. ability to monitor cislunar space. </p>\n\n<p>The first Oracle satellite is <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/air-force-research-laboratory-delays-lunar-experiment/\">expected to launch in 2027</a>. It <a href=\"https://www.advancedspace.com/missions/oracle/\">will be located</a> at <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-a-lagrange-point/\">a Lagrange point</a>, which is a spot between the Earth and the Moon where the gravitational pull of each object keeps the spacecraft in a stable position. From there, it can detect objects in cislunar space that sensors on Earth cannot see. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDPBaetbKE4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Oracle satellite would help the U.S. monitor activity in cislunar space.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Improving monitoring is only one part of the solution. Entities sending missions to the Moon, including governments and companies, will need to share the locations of their operational missions and coordinate to avoid predicted collisions.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/cara/madcap/\">NASA program dedicated to tracking and assessing lunar traffic</a> is helping to facilitate this effort. The program compares individual operators’ information about their spacecraft’s current and future planned location to identify potential close approaches. In the future, this type of coordination could improve safety, when combined with sensor observations from systems like Oracle. </p>\n\n<p>Countries and companies planning missions to the Moon could also try to coordinate before they launch their systems, so no missions end up operating too close together. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/space-law-hasnt-been-changed-since-1967-but-the-un-aims-to-update-laws-and-keep-space-peaceful-171351\">The Outer Space Treaty</a>, a set of basic principles developed early in the space age, requires that countries avoid harmfully interfering with other countries’ activities, but the treaty <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/space-law-hasnt-been-changed-since-1967-but-the-un-aims-to-update-laws-and-keep-space-peaceful-171351\">doesn’t outline how to do this</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/copuos/index.html\">United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space</a> <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/copuos/atlac/index.html\">formed a team</a> in February 2025 that hopes to address these and other coordination issues on the Moon. </p>\n\n<p>With government and commercial missions to the Moon increasing, and NASA’s next human mission to the Moon planned for early 2026, countries will need to work together to protect everyone’s interest in the Moon.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261344/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Mariel Borowitz has previously received funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation.  </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brian Gunter has current or prior funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

The link that I found then – and that numerous studies have since echoed – is that signature size is related to status and one’s sense of self. </p>\n\n<h2>Signature size and self-esteem</h2>\n\n<p>Back in 1967, during my senior year of college, I was a work-study student in Wesleyan University’s psychology library. My task, four nights a week, was to check out books and to reshelve books that had been returned. </p>\n\n<p>When students or faculty took books out, they were asked to sign their names on an orange, unlined card found in each book. </p>\n\n<p>At some point, I noticed a pattern: When faculty signed the books out, they used a lot of space to sign their names. When students checked them out, they used very little space, leaving a lot of space for future readers. </p>\n\n<p>So I decided to study my observation systematically. </p>\n\n<p>I gathered at least 10 signatures for each faculty member and comparison samples of student signatures with the same number of letters in their names. After measuring by multiplying the height versus the width of the amount of space used, I  found that eight of the nine faculty members <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.1970.9919908\">used significantly more space</a> to sign their names. </p>\n\n<p>In order to test for age as well as status, I did another study in which I compared the signatures of blue-collar workers such as custodians and groundskeepers who worked at the school with a sample of professors and a sample of students – again matched for the number of letters, this time on blank 3-by-5-inch cards. The blue-collar workers used more space than the students but less than the faculty. I concluded that age was at play, but so was status.</p>\n\n<p>When I told psychologist Karl Scheibe, my favorite teacher, about my findings, he said I could measure the signatures in his books, which he had been signing for more than a decade since his freshman year in college. </p>\n\n<p>As can be seen in the graph, his book signatures mostly got bigger. They took a major leap in size from his junior year to his senior year, dipped a bit when he entered graduate school and then increased in size as he completed his Ph.D. and joined the Wesleyan faculty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/h0034503\">did a few</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2224/SBP.1977.5.1.177\">more studies</a>, and published a few articles, concluding that signature size was related to self-esteem and a measure of what I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/h0034503\">termed “status awareness</a>.” I found that the pattern held in a number of different environments, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.1978.9924179\">including in Iran</a> – where people write from right to left.</p>\n\n<h2>The narcissism connection</h2>\n\n<p>Although my subsequent research <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5771/9781442207677\">included a book about the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies</a>, it never crossed my mind to look at the signatures of these CEOs.</p>\n\n<p>However, it did cross the minds of some researchers, 40 years later. In May 2013, I received a call from the editor of the Harvard Business Review because of the work I had done on signature size. They planned to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/05/size-does-matter-in-signatures\">run an interview with Nick Seybert</a>, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Maryland, about the potential link between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-017-9427-x\">signature size and narcissism</a> in CEOs. </p>\n\n<p>While Seybert told me his research had not found direct evidence for a positive relationship between the two, the possibility of the connection he inferred nonetheless intrigued me.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to test this using a sample of my students. I asked them to sign a blank 3-by-5 card as if they were writing a check, and then I gave them <a href=\"https://psytests.org/darktriad/npi16en.html\">a widely used 16-item narcissism scale</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lo and behold, Seybert was right to deduce a link: There was a significant positive correlation between signature size and narcissism. Although my sample size was small, the link subsequently led Seybert to test two different samples of his students. And he <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-017-9427-x\">found the same significant, positive correlation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Others soon began to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11301-025-00538-0\">use signature size to assess narcissism in CEOs</a>. By 2020, growing interest in the topic saw the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206319892678\">Journal of Management publish an article</a> that included signature size as one of five ways to measure narcissism in CEOs. </p>\n\n<h2>A growing field</h2>\n\n<p>Now, almost six years later, researchers have used signature size to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.888618\">explore narcissism in CEOs</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-025-09902-7\">other senior corporate positions such as chief financial officers</a>. The link has been found not only in the U.S. but in countries including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/RBF-05-2020-0091\">the United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.3375\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2016.09.004\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://qjfep.ir/browse.php?a_id=1638&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en\">Iran</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/csr.3065\">South Africa</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1540496X.2025.2468359\">China</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, some researchers have studied the effect of larger versus smaller signatures on the viewers. For example, in a recent article in the Journal of Philanthropy, Canadian researchers reported on three studies that systematically varied the signature size of someone soliciting funds in order to see whether it affected the size of donations. It did. In one of their studies, they found that increasing the size of the sender’s signature <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/nvsm.70011\">generated more than twice as much revenue</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The surprising resurgence of research using signature size to assess narcissism leads me to a few conclusions. </p>\n\n<p>For one, signature size as a measure of certain aspects of personality has turned out to be much more robust than I imagined as an observant undergraduate working in a college library back in 1967. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, signature size is not only an indicator of status and self-esteem, as I once concluded. It is also, as recent studies suggest, an indicator of narcissistic tendencies – the kind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/trump-nyt-ad-george-conway-pac\">that many argue</a> are exhibited by Trump’s big, bold signature.</p>\n\n<p>Where this research is taken next is anyone’s guess, least of all for the person who noticed something intriguing about signature size so many years ago.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267572/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Richie Zweigenhaft does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

While each side casts blame on the other, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/27/government-shutdown-funding-programs-00622376?cid=apn\">it is Americans who suffer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the shutdown is just another episode in a series of polarization-fueled events that are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/\">leading Americans to lose faith in their government</a>. Every nation has it limits, and one wonders how much America can take before the pressure to divide into separate countries becomes too great. </p>\n\n<p>Consider the aftermath of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/charlie-kirk-and-the-making-of-an-ai-generated-martyr-265834\">the assassination of Charlie Kirk</a>, which raised the specter of polarization-fueled conflict in America. Mentions of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/technology/charlie-kirk-shooting-civil-war.html\">“civil war” surged online</a>, fears grew over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/charlie-kirk-political-violence.html\">rising political violence</a>, and the Trump administration vowed to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/15/trump-plans-crackdown-on-left-wing-groups-after-charlie-kirk-shooting/86166121007/\">crack down on left-leaning groups</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These are merely the latest examples of the mounting pressure on the American political system. A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/times-siena-poll-political-polarization.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\">New York Times/Siena poll</a> found that 64% of Americans think the country is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems. The same poll showed that only 42% of Americans held that position in 2020. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, nearly two-thirds of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/americans-agree-politics-is-broken-here-are-5-ideas-for-fixing-key-problems-243553\">Americans think the system is broken</a>, and the number is growing fast.</p>\n\n<h2>Calls for a national divorce</h2>\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that some are calling for radical solutions like a national divorce. </p>\n\n<p>On Sept. 15, 2025, five days after Kirk’s killing, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that America needs “<a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1967550436337996189\">a peaceful national divorce</a>. Our country is too far gone and too far divided, and it’s no longer safe for any of us.” </p>\n\n<p>National divorce is the term used to describe the splitting of America into two parts: a red America and a blue America. Secessionist movements like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YesCalifornia\">Yes California</a> and <a href=\"https://redstatesecession.org/\">Red-State Secession</a> have for over a decade been calling for a national divorce along political lines. And a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/03/16/two-americas-index-national-divorce?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&amp;stream=to\">2023 Axios poll</a> found that as many as 20% of Americans see national divorce as a solution to political polarization.</p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/ryan-griffiths\">political scientist</a> who studies secessionist conflict, I’ve found that the national divorce argument is commonly used as an analogy with marital divorce. Just as two spouses may be extremely ill-suited for one another, and far better off if they separated, the same can be said of red and blue America. They no longer see eye to eye on a range of issues, from reproductive rights to the environment and gun control. </p>\n\n<p>If they seceded from one another and formed their own countries, the argument goes, then they could establish policies that would ensure the future they wanted. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman dressed in jeans and a blazer walks down a hall followed by two men.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699043/original/file-20251028-56-2tmjbp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Rep.

Additionally, a large and increasingly ignored percentage of Americans hold moderate views. </p>\n\n<p>There is no doubt that polarization in America is a problem that is getting worse, but a national divorce is simply not the solution.</p>\n\n<p>And yet America’s leaders continue to lead their country toward that outcome. The <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/blue-states-fight-back-trumps-national-guard-moves-politics-desk-rcna236038\">deployment of National Guard troops to blue cities</a>, the polarization-enhancing consequences of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tit-for-tat-gerrymandering-wars-wont-end-soon-what-happens-in-texas-and-california-doesnt-stay-there-262835\">competitive gerrymandering</a> in states like Texas and California, and the spectacle of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2025/10/07/government-shutdown-economy-wall-street/86563636007/\">government shutdown</a> are eroding the public trust. By continuing with policies that amplify polarization and erode the public trust, America’s leaders are fueling the calls for a national divorce.</p>\n\n<h2>How much can the country take?</h2>\n\n<p>The trend toward heightened polarization in America is not irreversible, but there are limits to how much the country can take before secession becomes a serious project. Some of the limits can be identified in advance.</p>\n\n<p>First, it’s important that the country’s leaders take the pulse of America. If 20% of Americans favored national divorce in early 2023, what is the percentage now? That kind of sentiment can increase surprisingly fast. </p>\n\n<p>Between 2006 and 2014, for example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773914000174\">Catalonian support for independence from Spain</a> increased from 14% to 45%. If something like 50% of Americans concluded that America didn’t work and was better off broken up into smaller parts, then the country could tip rapidly into a secessionist crisis.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Hundreds of people hold signs that hide their faces.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699044/original/file-20251028-56-mgspyp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People hold up signs during a memorial for Charlie Kirk on Sept. 21, 2025, in Glendale, Ariz.

The polarization-inspired assassination of prominent leaders can lead to a <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501754746/secession-and-the-sovereignty-game/#bookTabs=1\">cycle of recrimination</a>. Upcoming elections are also a concern. If they are closely contested and the losing side is unwilling to admit defeat, then the bedrock of democracy is broken. Both triggers can accelerate polarization and the turn to secessionism.</p>\n\n<p>A third threshold moment is when a prominent leader decides to champion the cause of a national divorce. </p>\n\n<p>Should someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott or the sore loser of a 2028 election conclude that the system is rigged, and secession is the only solution, then the entire project gains legitimacy. </p>\n\n<p>It was that kind of <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501725982/national-secession/#bookTabs=1\">elite conversion</a> to the secessionist cause that energized the movement in places like Scotland and Catalonia.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. is a robust country and the longest-running democracy in the world. Americans have <a href=\"https://convergencepolicy.org/news_room/press-release-the-left-and-right-think-they-live-on-different-planets-new-data-shows-theyre-more-like-next-door-neighbors/\">more in common</a> than they realize, and the country can be a positive force in the world.</p>\n\n<p>But without decisive action by political leaders to reduce the polarization that threatens to tear the country apart, the United States is at risk of turning from one country into two.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267812/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan D.

But I would like to offer a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>I am a researcher studying how young people with autism <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/4030579\">transition to adulthood</a>. I also work on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/autism/addm-network/index.html\">Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network</a>, which was established by the CDC two decades ago to determine the prevalence of autism in the U.S. and which produced the 2025 report.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this topic is <a href=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/health/arizona-state-researcher-conducts-me-search-on-autism-with-national-impact\">deeply personal</a> to me, since I am diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928\">Asperger’s syndrome, now known as autism spectrum disorder</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While autism does present challenges, my professional and personal experiences have taught me that creating space for autistic people’s perspectives affords opportunities for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/rfk-jr-said-many-autistic-people-will-never-write-a-poem-even-though-theres-a-rich-history-of-neurodivergent-poets-and-writers-255367\">making the world a more vibrant place</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A rare condition?</h2>\n\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental condition that manifests differently from person to person but commonly affects how a person <a href=\"https://iacc.hhs.gov/about-iacc/subcommittees/resources/dsm5-diagnostic-criteria.shtml\">communicates, socializes and interacts with the world</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, researchers and clinicians estimated that autism was a relatively rare condition, <a href=\"https://autismcenter.org/autism-through-the-years\">affecting an estimated 1 in 500 children</a>. But the real-world experiences of families and clinicians suggested that it was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1022115520317\">more common</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In a landmark study published in 1998, researchers examined autism prevalence in a community in New Jersey to determine a more realistic estimate in the U.S. population. They found that approximately <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.108.5.1155\">1 in 150 children had autism</a> – making it more than three times more common than previously believed. </p>\n\n<p>Then, in 2000, the newly formed Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which set out to study autism among 8-year-olds, looked across a much broader population and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/PDF/ss/ss5601.pdf\">confirmed the higher prevalence</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>A growing recognition</h2>\n\n<p>Since then, the number of children recognized as having autism by a doctor or an education specialist has continued to rise. The 2025 report shows that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/pdfs/ss7402a1-H.pdf\">autism occurs in all types of communities</a>. Autism affects children regardless of race, ethnicity or income level.</p>\n\n<p>Autism prevalence does vary by location, though. It is highest in California, where it is recognized in around 1 in 19 children, and lowest in Texas, where the prevalence ranges from around 1 in 103 to 1 in 51 children. In Arizona, where I live and work, the prevalence is around 1 in 32, which is very close to the CDC’s overall nationwide estimate. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Middle school students work on a robotics project with a teacher\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698984/original/file-20251028-56-coba5h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">More boys than girls are diagnosed with autism, but this gap is shrinking as researchers better understand how the condition differs across genders.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/teacher-helping-students-in-robotics-class-royalty-free-image/694015729\">Ariel Skelley/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Researchers believe that this wide geographic variability in autism prevalence <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2696\">reflects complex interactions</a> between community awareness and acceptance, the availability of clinical and education services in schools and communities that serve people with autism, broader culture acceptance of mental health challenges, and other societal factors. </p>\n\n<p>The number of autism diagnoses also varies by gender. One well-known feature of autism is that it affects boys more often than girls. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/PDF/ss/ss5601.pdf\">four boys for every one girl</a> was diagnosed with autism. This <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6103.pdf\">disparity persisted</a> <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/pdfs/ss6706a1-H.pdf\">for many</a> <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/pdfs/ss7011a1-H.pdf\">years</a>. But now, it seems to be shrinking: In the May 2025 data, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/pdfs/ss7402a1-H.pdf\">ratio for boys versus girls is 3.4 to 1</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This shift reflects the growing understanding <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2927\">that autism looks different in girls</a> than in boys, which in turn allows clinicians to accurately identify it in girls in larger numbers.</p>\n\n<h2>From recognition to acceptance</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-02636-1\">Research shows, however</a>, that this increase in autism diagnoses is not something to fear.</p>\n\n<p>While some children diagnosed with autism are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549231163551\">profoundly affected</a> and require significant support, many others successfully engage in everyday activities like school, sports and work. One 2022 study found that a majority of children reported as having autism by their parents <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07419325211046050\">expect to attend college</a>. This suggests that many people diagnosed with autism feel they are capable of living full and productive lives.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, understanding the patterns of autism prevalence does not explain why it occurs in the first place. Research suggests that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721000192\">genes are a major cause of autism</a>. But many things have changed over the past several decades since researchers and clinicians began tracking autism occurrence. For example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/opinion/why-autism-rates-increased.html\">the criteria clinicians use to diagnose autism</a> have changed over time to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-04904-1\">become less restrictive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Today, a wider variety of symptoms are included in the diagnostic definition of autism spectrum disorder than when autism was first introduced as a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-04904-1\">mental health condition in 1980</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another change is that autism is much more widely accepted in society than it was just a decade ago. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autistic_fictional_characters\">autistic characters are often portrayed in media</a> as protagonists that the audience is cheering for. This growing recognition and acceptance is associated with an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-023-06150-z\">increase in self-diagnosis of autism</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Building richer communities</h2>\n\n<p>While autistic people tend to have <a href=\"https://www.kennedykrieger.org/stories/interactive-autism-network-ian/challenging-behaviors\">some unique challenges</a>, including repetitive behaviors, restricted interests and social communication difficulties, they also have particular strengths, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04575-4\">creative, out-of-the-box thinking</a>. For me, this includes seeing connections that others miss.</p>\n\n<p>Autistic people report that their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2021.0037\">unique perspective offers specific benefits</a> in their workplaces and careers. Many go on to <a href=\"https://www.bluesprigautism.com/blog/famous-people-with-autism/\">make important contributions</a> to their communities and to shape society as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Temple Grandin, <a href=\"https://www.templegrandin.com/\">an outspoken author and speaker on autism</a> and a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, has credited her autism with influencing her research on animal handling and animal behaviors. Comedian Dan Aykroyd, who was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2004/11/22/4181931/comedian-and-writer-dan-aykroyd\">an original cast member and host of “Saturday Night Live”</a>, credits his diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome and fixation on ghosts for <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2521032/Dan-Aykroyd-I-Aspergers--symptoms-included-obsessed-ghosts.html\">developing the movie “Ghostbusters”</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A more complete picture of autism that includes strengths as well as challenges creates a starting point for building communities that are inclusive and accepting of autistic people. From there, policymakers, employers and others can start to create dynamic and vibrant places where people with autism can successfully live, work and play alongside their nonautistic peers.</p>\n\n<p>And, given that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2868\">children with autism will become adults with autism</a>, it allows experts like me to identify needs and design policies that help communities support autistic people at different stages of their life. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A close-up of an infinity shape brooch on the sweater of an adult who is squeezing a stress ball.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698585/original/file-20251027-64-b9sifj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Programs that hire, train and retain workers with disabilities and accommodations, such as working from home, can help people with autism participate in the labor force and achieve economic success.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/high-angle-view-of-infinity-shape-brooch-on-t-shirt-royalty-free-image/2190839399\">Maskot/DigitalVision via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For example, the growing number of students with developmental challenges <a href=\"https://leader.pubs.asha.org/do/10.1044/leader.AAG.26082021.23/full/\">raises demands on special education services</a>. This means state and local education systems may need to develop and implement specialized training programs for educators to better support autistic students in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>Autistic children who need accommodations in school may also need support to succeed in adulthood. This can range from having physicians who <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361315576221\">gear their clinical practices</a> to better listen to autistic patients to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2019.1635658\">work-from-home and other accommodations</a> that encourage engagement with traditional employment. </p>\n\n<p>Broader frameworks such as laws and policies can also help attune workplaces and other environments to the needs of people with autism. For example, <a href=\"https://firstplaceaz.org/\">independent living programs</a> and programs that <a href=\"https://thearc.org/our-initiatives/employment/\">train, hire and retain workers with disabilities</a> can ensure the economic success of people with autism. </p>\n\n<p>Cities can also become <a href=\"https://ibcces.org/autism_certified_city/#gSjfAHeN\">autism certified</a>, a process that brings together community stakeholders in health care, education, local government, hospitality and leisure to better serve those with autism. This includes training on how to interact with people who have cognitive differences as well as creating sensory-friendly environments. The city that I live in – Mesa, Arizona – <a href=\"https://www.visitmesa.com/travel-accessibility/autism-travel/\">was the first to gain</a> such certification in 2019, and a <a href=\"https://autismtravel.com/travel-directory/\">handful of other cities</a> have followed suit. </p>\n\n<p>As I see it, rather than a cause for fear, the growing recognition of autism is an invitation to build a world where every way of thinking and being has a chance to thrive.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257811/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Anbar receives funding from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.

If true, such a weapon could provide Russia with a unique military capability that also has broader political implications. </p>\n\n<p>The missile, called Burevestnik, was reportedly successfully tested over the Arctic Ocean after years of development and several earlier initial test flights, one of which resulted in the <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2019/08/the-nenoksa-accident-a-timeline-of-confusing-and-conflicting-reports/\">deaths of five nuclear scientists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am an engineer who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=0vO6w7MAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies defense systems</a>. Here is how these weapons function, the advantages they present over conventional missile systems, and their potential to disrupt global strategic stability.</p>\n\n<h2>Conventionally powered missiles</h2>\n\n<p>Missiles have been used by militaries around the world <a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html\">for centuries</a> and come in a broad array of designs that are characterized by their mission, range and velocity. They are used to damage and destroy a wide variety of targets, including ground installations such as bases, command centers and deeply buried infrastructure; ships; aircraft; and potentially spacecraft. These weapons are operated from the ground by the army, from the sea by navy ships, and from the air by fighters and bombers. </p>\n\n<p>Missiles can be tactical, with relatively short ranges of less than 500 miles, or strategic, with long ranges of thousands of miles. Missiles fall into three general categories: <a href=\"https://www.space.com/19601-how-intercontinental-ballistic-missiles-work-infographic.html\">ballistic</a>, <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/subs/weapons/armament/missiles/\">cruise</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chinas-hypersonic-missiles-threaten-us-power-in-the-pacific-an-aerospace-engineer-explains-how-the-weapons-work-and-the-unique-threats-they-pose-206271\">hypersonic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ballistic missiles are launched on rockets. After the rocket burns out, the missile flies along a predictable arc that takes it out of the atmosphere into space and then back into the atmosphere toward its target.</p>\n\n<p>Cruise missiles have an additional engine that is ignited after the rocket burns out, allowing the missile to fly programmed routes, typically at low altitudes. These engines are powered by a mixture of chemicals or a solid fuel.</p>\n\n<p>Hypersonic missiles fly faster than the speed of sound, but not as fast as intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. They are launched on smaller rockets that keep them within the upper reaches of the atmosphere. A hypersonic glide vehicle is boosted to high altitude and then glides to its target, maneuvering along the way. A hypersonic cruise missile is boosted to hypersonic speed and then uses an air-breathing engine <a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/scramjet.html\">called a scramjet</a> to sustain that speed.</p>\n\n<h2>How nuclear-powered missiles work</h2>\n\n<p>Nuclear-powered missiles are a type of cruise missile. The designs are typically a form of scramjet. A thermal nuclear system uses fission of nuclear fuel to <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2019/08/project-pluto-and-trouble-with-the-russian-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile/\">add energy to an airstream</a> that is then accelerated through a nozzle to generate thrust.

This feature means that a relatively small amount of fissionable propellant can be used to power a missile for much longer periods of time than chemical propellants can.</p>\n\n<p>The United States explored developing a nuclear-powered missile in the 1960s. The effort, <a href=\"https://www.sandboxx.us/news/project-pluto-the-most-insane-missile-america-ever-built/\">Project Pluto</a>, was abandoned due to the rapid progress made at the same time on ICBMs, as well as concerns over environmental contamination associated with nuclear systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of nuclear-powered flight</h2>\n\n<p>The key advantage of nuclear-powered missiles is the extra energy, which allows them to fly farther, longer, faster and lower in the atmosphere, while executing a wide array of maneuvers. For these reasons, they pose a significant challenge to the best missile defense systems. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian military claims that the Burevestnik missile flew 8,700 miles at low altitude over a 15-hour period. For comparison, an airline flight from San Francisco to Boston covers 2,700 miles in six hours. While the Burevestnik vehicle is not flying particularly fast for a missile, it is likely maneuverable, which makes it difficult to defend against.</p>\n\n<h2>Challenges to using nuclear power</h2>\n\n<p>The huge amount of energy released by fission has been the key technical challenge for developing these missiles. The high levels of energy require materials that can withstand temperatures up to several thousand degrees Fahrenheit to prevent the missile from destroying itself. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of safety, nuclear technology has found very limited application in space due to concerns over radiation contamination if something goes wrong, such as a failed launch. The same concerns apply to a nuclear-powered munition. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, such systems may need to remain safe in storage for many years prior to use. An attack by an enemy on a weapons storage facility that contains nuclear-powered weapons could lead to a massive radiation leak.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-8Jarqv7hY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Early development of a nuclear-powered missile by the United States in the 1950s and ’60s ended after it became clear the idea was strategically and environmentally challenging.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Russia’s Burevestnik and global stability</h2>\n\n<p>The new Russian Burevestnik missile has been under development <a href=\"https://iz.ru/768533/2018-07-19/opublikovany-kadry-krylatoi-rakety-neogranichennoi-dalnosti-burevestnik\">for over 20 years</a>. While few technical details are known, Russian officials claim that it <a href=\"https://www.twz.com/nuclear/skyfall-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile-long-range-test-claimed-by-russia\">can maneuver</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putin-uses-old-missile-technology-to-send-a-new-message-to-the-west-7c55bcc4\">bypass antimissile and air defense systems</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Nuclear weapons were the basis for <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/mutual-assured-destruction\">mutual deterrence</a> between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. Both parties understood that a first strike by one side would be matched by an equally destructive counterstrike by the other. The fear of total annihilation maintained a peaceful balance.</p>\n\n<p>Several developments threaten the current balance of power: better missile defense systems such as the U.S.’s planned <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/golden-dome-dangers-an-arms-control-expert-explains-how-trumps-missile-defense-threatens-to-make-the-us-less-safe-258048\">Golden Dome</a> and advances in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chinas-hypersonic-missiles-threaten-us-power-in-the-pacific-an-aerospace-engineer-explains-how-the-weapons-work-and-the-unique-threats-they-pose-206271\">highly maneuverable missiles</a>. Missile defense systems have the potential to block a nuclear strike, and low-altitude maneuverable missiles have the potential to arrive without warning.</p>\n\n<p>So, while much of the reaction to Russia’s announcement of its new nuclear-powered missile has focused on the challenges of defending against it, the more important concern may be its potential to completely disrupt global strategic stability.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268476/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Iain Boyd receives funding from the U.S. Department of Defense.</span></em></p>",

That year, an estimated 48.2 million people – about 18% of the U.S. population under age 65 – <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_legacy_files//198861/trends-in-the-us-uninsured.pdf\">did not have health insurance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By 2023, the number of uninsured Americans <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/uninsured/health-policy-101-the-uninsured-population-and-health-coverage/?entry=table-of-contents-trends-in-the-uninsured-rate#content\">had dropped by nearly 50%</a>, to 25.3 million people under 65, or 9.5% of the total population.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vfl8OecAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">gerontologist who studies the U.S. health care system</a>. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/health-insurance-subsidy-standoff-pits-affordable-care-for-millions-against-federal-budget-constraints-266851\">ACA health care subsidies are at the center</a> of a now <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-latest-senate-republicans-vance/\">monthlong U.S. government shutdown</a> that could become the longest in U.S. history. So I looked at the available data about ACA marketplace plan usage in Florida to understand how the debates in Washington could affect access to health care in the Sunshine State going forward.</p>\n\n<h2>How the ACA expanded access to health insurance</h2>\n\n<p>The ACA implemented a three-pronged strategy to expand access to affordable health insurance.</p>\n\n<p>One was the use of fines. The government fined anyone – <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/\">until 2018</a> – who chose not to get health insurance. The government also fined businesses with 50 or more full-time employees that didn’t offer their employees affordable health care plans. The idea was to offer incentives for healthy people to get insurance to lower costs for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the fines had little impact on the number of insured Americans, with one notable exception: The employer-required expansion allowed young adults ages 19 to 25 to remain on their parents’ health insurance plan. For this group, <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-coverage-access-care-among-young-adults-ages-19-25\">the uninsured rate dropped</a> from 31.5% in 2010 to 13.1% in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the ACA allowed for Medicaid to be expanded to low-income Americans who were employed but working in low-wage jobs. The expansion of Medicaid to low-income workers at 138% of the federal poverty level was originally required nationwide. But a 2012 Supreme Court ruling <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/519/\">allowed states to choose</a> whether they would participate in Medicaid expansion.</p>\n\n<p>As of 2025, 16 million Americans are covered by the expansion. However, 10 states, including Florida, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/\">have opted out</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The third way the ACA changed the health insurance system is that it established health insurance subsidies that the government can provide. Those subsidies are for low- and moderate-income Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employers and aren’t eligible for Medicaid, Medicare or any other government-operated health insurance program.</p>\n\n<p>This established a <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/\">private health insurance marketplace</a> that would include federal subsidies to make insurance more affordable. As of October 2025, more than <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/\">24 million Americans currently get their health insurance</a> through the subsidized marketplace.</p>\n\n<h2>Florida and the ACA marketplace</h2>\n\n<p>The number of people insured under the ACA in each state varies. But the state with the largest number of residents on <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-insurance-marketplace-glossary/\">marketplace insurance plans</a> is Florida. About <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">4.7 million Florida residents</a> are covered through these plans, representing <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-detail.html\">27% of the state’s under-65 population</a>, compared to the national average of 8.8%. Of those on marketplace plans, 98% <a href=\"https://interactives.commonwealthfund.org/2025/marketplace-fact-sheets/Florida.pdf\">receive a subsidy at some level</a>. </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RcLCT\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RcLCT/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons why this rate is so much higher in Florida than elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>First, only 40% of Sunshine State residents are <a href=\"https://www.benefitnews.com/list/states-with-the-most-employer-provided-health-insurance#:%7E:text=Utah%20has%20the%20most%20residents%20covered%20by,Florida%20has%20the%20least%2C%20according%20to%20AHIP\">covered by an employer-based health insurance plan</a>, compared to 49% for the nation as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>This is the lowest rate in the country. A contributing factor is that Florida ranks fifth in the proportion of workforce that is self-employed, with <a href=\"https://cw33.com/news/most-popular-states-self-employment/\">1.3 million Floridians in this category</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The state’s lower rate could also be related to the high number of <a href=\"https://flgov.com/eog/sites/default/files/shared/2024/12/Visit%20Florida%20EIS%202023_0.pdf\">seasonal and part-time workers in the tourism industry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that the state has relatively <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-medicaid-and-americas-long-struggle-to-establish-a-health-care-safety-net-251776\">few people enrolled in Medicaid</a>, the federal program that provides mainly low-income people with health insurance coverage. Among Floridians ages 44 to 64, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/medicaid-state-fact-sheets/\">only 11% are enrolled in Medicaid</a>, compared to 17% for the nation overall.</p>\n\n<p>Florida hasn’t expanded Medicaid, and it’s also more restrictive than most states about who can enroll in the program.</p>\n\n<p>States <a href=\"https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-income-chart/\">set their own Medicaid eligibility criteria</a>, and they determine what services Medicaid will cover and at what cost. Florida has the second-lowest Medicaid expenditures per enrollee in the nation, and it ranks last on Medicaid expenditures for adults under 65.</p>\n\n<h2>An uncertain path ahead</h2>\n\n<p>Because Florida residents rely heavily on marketplace plans, ending ACA subsidies would have a big effect on Floridians.</p>\n\n<p>Unless Congress reverses course and preserves the insurance subsidies that have not been renewed, the average marketplace plan premium is <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\">predicted to increase by more than 100%</a>, from $74 to $159 per month. An American earning $28,000 annually – $13.50 per hour – would see a fivefold increase, from $27 to $130 per month. And a worker making $35,000 per year would see their premium increase from $86 to $217 per month.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"wGBoe\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wGBoe/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>At 13.4%, Florida already has the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/uninsured/health-policy-101-the-uninsured-population-and-health-coverage/?entry=table-of-contents-introduction#content\">third-highest proportion of uninsured residents under 65</a>. It is safe to assume that if the federal marketplace subsidies disappear and health insurance premiums become unaffordable for more people, the result will be <a href=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/politics/politifact/florida-aca-credits-health-care-government-shutdown/3710336/\">more uninsured Floridians</a>. And if healthy, younger people can’t afford insurance, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/26/nx-s1-5577940/health-insurance-government-shutdown-aca-open-enrollment-death-spiral\">premiums are likely to go up</a> for everyone else with insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The path to resolve the ongoing debate is uncertain. In my view, however, it is clear that states such as Florida, Texas and Georgia, which haven’t expanded Medicaid and rely heavily on the marketplace plans, will be dramatically affected by cuts to federal subsidies.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268269/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Applebaum does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

On plantations, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315419053\">enslavers controlled where and how the enslaved were buried</a> and whether burials could be marked or visited. In cities from Charleston to New York, <a href=\"https://www.ccpl.org/charleston-time-machine/forgotten-dead-charlestons-public-cemeteries-1672-1794\">segregated burial grounds</a>, many now forgotten, were established by local authorities for indigent Black and white people.</p>\n\n<p>Pushed to the margins, people of African descent maintained burial traditions and used impermanent or specific grave markers such as shells, bottles, clocks or ceramics – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03374216\">items that were culturally meaningful</a> but often invisible or unimportant to white observers. As a result, many of these sites were neither recorded in historical documents nor officially recognized as burial grounds.</p>\n\n<p>From the 1770s, <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/stories/first-baptist-church-williamsburg\">African American churches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uapress.com/product/black-charlestonians/\">benevolent societies and funeral homes</a> sought to establish cemeteries where Black communities could honor the dead with dignity. What began regionally – especially in Charleston and Philadelphia – quickly spread nationally during the 19th century across the American South and North. </p>\n\n<p>In the decades after Reconstruction, and especially during the Jim Crow era, nearly <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/long-lasting-legacy-great-migration-180960118/\">6 million African Americans moved north and west</a> to escape racial violence and seek better opportunities – an event known as the Great Migration. This movement often <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190696/the-warmth-of-other-suns-by-isabel-wilkerson/\">severed ties between families</a> and ancestral burial grounds in the South. As churches and burial societies lost members, many cemeteries fell into disrepair and were <a href=\"https://charlestoncitypaper.com/2008/07/02/hidden-heritage/\">officially labeled “abandoned” by local authorities or developers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In both rural and urban areas, Black burial grounds were often located on less valuable lands, sites that today are increasingly threatened by gentrification, development and the effects of <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/11/historic-black-cemeteries-threatened-by-extreme-weather/\">climate change</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ugapress.org/9780820327839/the-gullah-people-and-their-african-heritage/\">Gullah Geechee</a>, who descend from enslaved Africans from West Africa and still preserve unique cultural traditions in the southeastern U.S., argue <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/04/when-black-history-is-unearthed-who-gets-to-speak-for-the-dead\">these burial sites were never abandoned and that ancestors are still present</a>. This perspective views the dead as actively connected to the living. For them, lacking formally designated cemetery space doesn’t make the sites any less sacred.   </p>\n\n<h2>A tradition of sacred spaces</h2>\n\n<p>For many African Americans, especially in the South, death during slavery was seen as not merely an ending but a spiritual return — a “homegoing.”</p>\n\n<p>Rooted in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/africanatlantic-cultures-and-the-south-carolina-lowcountry/C02F984E2F2C945B9B945496EF28CE6B\">West African spiritual worldviews and carried through other traditions in America</a>, the act of burial was often viewed as a release from bondage, a return to the ancestors and a step toward wholeness. </p>\n\n<p>The Gullah Geechee traditions of coastal South Carolina emphasize ancestral presence, spiritual continuity and the sanctity of the land. In that worldview, with a porous boundary between the living and the dead, proper burial and remembrance are not only cultural imperatives but necessary for community well-being.</p>\n\n<p>It was not until the early 1990s that recognition of rights over ancestral remains and sacred burial grounds began to find a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by the 1990 <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/subtitle-A/part-10\">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> that recognized Indigenous rights over ancestral remains, African American communities increasingly asserted their own rights to ethical research, respectful handling and meaningful memorialization, especially during the 1991 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03374233\">New York African Burial Ground</a> project, which reshaped public memory and <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3069222\">archaeological ethics</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Discovered during construction in lower Manhattan, the 18th-century burial ground contained the remains of more than 400 enslaved and free Africans. Community advocacy led to the site’s protection, descendant-led research, ceremonial reburial and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/afbg/index.htm\">establishment of a national memorial in 2006</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A monument plaque.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696218/original/file-20251014-56-103s85.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Outdoor Memorial of the African Burial Ground National Monument in lower Manhattan is an important archaeological find of the 20th century and one of the most preeminent memorials to the struggle of Africans and African descendants.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-outdoor-memorial-of-the-african-burial-ground-national-news-photo/557697049?adppopup=true\">Keith Getter/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Since this time, across the U.S. and the Atlantic world, descendant-led ceremonies from <a href=\"https://africanburyinggroundnh.org/index.html\">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.africanburialgroundathiggsbeach.org/discovery\">Key West, Florida</a>, have restored dignity to ancestral remains. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, efforts to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01320-4\">preserve African American</a> burial grounds, <a href=\"https://americananthro.org/about/committees-and-task-forces/tcethr/\">including by national scholar organizations</a> and <a href=\"https://adams.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/adams-files-amendment-fund-african-american-burial-grounds-preservation\">federal lawmakers</a>, continue amid political debates over how history should be remembered and taught. </p>\n\n<h2>What made the Anson Street project unique</h2>\n\n<p>In Charleston, the Anson Street African Burial Ground project stands out for the way Gullah Geechee traditions and descendant collaboration shaped every stage of the process — from scientific study to reinterment.</p>\n\n<p>Launched as a community-led initiative in 2017, the team began by listening. Through regular gatherings, they invited questions about the ancestors’ lives and identities, and about their hopes for the reburial, centering Black community voices at every stage. The team combined <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.24149\">scientific investigations of ancestry and health</a> while also creating space for spiritual guidance, ceremony and descendant leadership. In doing so, the project became more than a study of the past; it became a communal act of repair and remembrance, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2023.105\">reconnecting Charleston’s present communities with the ancestors whose stories</a> had long been buried.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next two years, the team wove this commitment into every aspect of its work: youth art programs, a college course on memorial design, public exhibitions, and school partnerships. One of the most moving moments came from conversations with schoolchildren, who decided that the ancestors should be given names before they were reburied.</p>\n\n<p>That naming ceremony took place in April 2019. The names were conferred by <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2152/ETD-UT-2009-08-309\">Natalie Washington-Weik, a Yorùbá-Orisa Ọ̀ṣun priestess</a>, a spiritual leader in a West African tradition and an African historian. She described the ritual as an “important step forward in reclaiming the humanity of the deceased people who were most likely forced to travel across the Atlantic Ocean under the terror of other humans – who saw them merely as animals.” </p>\n\n<p>The ancestors were finally reinterred in a powerful public ceremony that reflected their ancestries and West-Central African spiritual traditions. </p>\n\n<h2>When pain is acknowledged, healing can occur</h2>\n\n<p>The 2019 naming and reinterment ceremonies were not simply commemorations; they were rituals of remembrance and healing. </p>\n\n<p>Construction for a <a href=\"https://www.asabgproject.com/a-memorial-for-the-ancestors\">permanent memorial</a> at the Anson Street site, designed by artist Stephen L. Hayes Jr., has now begun. At its center is a basin fabricated with sacred soil collected from 36 African-descended burial grounds across the Charleston region. From the basin, 36 bronze hands will rise – cast from living community members whose profiles reflect those of the ancestors. Raised in gestures of prayer, resistance and reverence, these hands link past to present.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the memorialization process, community members reflected on what it meant to participate in such a project. Many spoke of feeling pride, reverence, joy, sadness and peace. “This conversation makes me feel complete,” one participant said.</p>\n\n<p>As Charleston demonstrates, these projects are not only about preserving the past – they are acts of recognition, respect and reconciliation, helping communities nationwide confront and honor the histories long denied to African-descended peoples.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260394/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanna Gilmore has received funding from the City of Charleston, the National Geographic Society, and the College of Charleston.

The amount of help received depends on a family’s income and the number and ages of the people in the household. Currently, benefits average <a href=\"https://clsphila.org/highlights/snap-fuels-pennsylvania\">just over US$6 per person per day</a>. In Pennsylvania, the monthly benefits are loaded onto participants’ <a href=\"https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dhs/resources/snap/ebt\">electronic benefits transfer cards</a>, or EBT cards, during the first 10 business days of each month.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have found that SNAP benefits <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap/action\">reduce poverty and food insecurity</a> – a term for when people don’t have consistent access to enough food for all household members to lead active, healthy lives. It also contributes to <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2019.04.027\">healthy growth and development in childhood</a>, and lower risks for obesity, diabetes, hypertension and poor mental health <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305325\">later in life</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Studies have also found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05265\">when eligible families lose access to SNAP benefits</a>, even temporarily, they are more likely to get sick, and their children are at a greater risk of developmental delays. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, losing SNAP and similar benefits can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05265\">strain household finances</a>, forcing low-income people to choose between skipping meals or forgoing other basic needs like rent, utilities and prescription drugs.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"RpGrZ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpGrZ/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>How is the government shutdown affecting SNAP benefits in Pennsylvania?</h2>\n\n<p>The Department of Agriculture notified SNAP state agency directors in October that it would stop funding the program should the shutdown continue past Nov. 1. The federal agency <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-food-aid-govenrment-shutdown/\">directed all states to withhold November benefits</a> until further notice. </p>\n\n<p>The USDA is taking this step even though it has <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snaps-contingency-reserve-is-available-for-regular-snap-benefits-as-usda\">more than $5 billion</a> in its coffers, which could fund approximately <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/the-trump-administration-can-and-should-take-available-steps-to-ensure-snap-participants-get\">two-thirds of what the nation spends each month</a> on SNAP benefits.</p>\n\n<p>In the more than <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/history\">60-year history</a> of SNAP and the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK206907/\">programs that preceded it</a>, the USDA has never before <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/the-trump-administration-can-and-should-take-available-steps-to-ensure-snap-participants-get\">refused to spend contingency funds</a> to disburse monthly benefits. During previous shutdowns, including the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis\">35 days in 2018-2019</a>, the federal government used the department’s contingency funds to ensure SNAP wasn’t interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 17, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services <a href=\"https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dhs/resources/snap\">issued a statement</a> to the more than <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/snap_factsheet_pennsylvania.pdf\">2 million Pennsylvanians participating in SNAP</a>. It warned them that they won’t receive their November benefits or any benefits thereafter until the USDA releases funds again. </p>\n\n<p>Pennsylvania is also among 17 states that have <a href=\"https://www.compass.dhs.pa.gov/home/#/\">suspended approving new SNAP applications</a> until the government reopens, leaving hundreds, if not thousands, of food-insecure families in a prolonged state of hardship. </p>\n\n<p>This disruption is likely to rattle the broader economy. About 12% of U.S. grocery sales are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/01/snap-benefit-cuts-americans-food-grocery-shopping.html\">made with SNAP benefits</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/snap-retailers-database\">over 9,800 supermarkets and other Pennsylvania retailers</a> accept them.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"KdbiX\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KdbiX/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What does this mean for people in Philadelphia?</h2>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.wgal.com/article/snap-recipients-pennsylvania/65379625\">over 470,000 SNAP recipients in Philadelphia</a> – 3 in 10 Philadelphians – who will not receive these benefits until the government shutdown ends.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, state agencies are urging people who get SNAP benefits to <a href=\"https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dhs\">visit food banks, food pantries and soup kitchens</a>, which are run by nonprofits and not the government. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that those organizations will be able to keep up. For every meal nonprofits provide, <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Feeding%20America%20orange%20slice%20AHPC%202020.pdf\">SNAP provides nine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pennsylvanias-budget-crisis-drags-on-as-fed-shutdown-adds-to-residents-hardships-267382\">Pennsylvania state budget impasse</a> – the Commonwealth has been without a budget for nearly four months – has already affected other state-run programs that <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/snap-benefits-government-shutdown-philadelphia-food-banks/\">food banks in Philadelphia</a> rely on.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly troubling because even when receiving their full benefit, most people who are enrolled in SNAP across the country say that they frequently <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/snap/barriers-constrain-adequacy-allotments\">struggle to afford a healthy diet</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Low-income parents and guardians in Philadelphia, according to research I’ve conducted and studies by my colleagues, say they strain to stretch their dollars to <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2025.03.009\">feed their children amid rising food prices</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100393\">skip meals or delay paying bills</a> when the benefit runs out before the end of the month. </p>\n\n<p>A robust body of evidence has demonstrated the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/134.6.1432\">serious mental and physical harm</a> that food insecurity – even for short periods – causes across the lifespan. It can lead to <a href=\"https://childrenshealthwatch.org/the-health-and-educational-costs-related-to-food-insecurity/\">billions of dollars of avoidable costs</a> due to health care and educational needs, and lost productivity.</p>\n\n<p>How this disruption of SNAP and other nutrition programs increases food insecurity will be hard to measure. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-scraps-the-nations-most-comprehensive-food-insecurity-report-making-it-harder-to-know-how-many-americans-struggle-to-get-enough-food-266006\">Trump administration has canceled</a> the USDA’s long-standing annual report on food security.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"AqPvV\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AqPvV/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>What can state and federal leaders do to fund the program?</h2>\n\n<p>The federal government and Pennsylvania lawmakers have options to at least restore some SNAP benefits in the state while the shutdown continues.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA can reverse its earlier ruling and disburse its more than $5 billion in emergency funds and issue guidance that states should continue to accept and process new SNAP applications. This would help states provide at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/food-stamps-agriculture-department.html\">partial benefits to their residents enrolled in SNAP</a> and ensure that new applicants get all the benefits they’re eligible for.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government can allocate discretionary and reserve funds to SNAP for the duration of the shutdown so benefits are not interrupted. The government did this with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-wic-food-a6d66fa0ce3d02257b5b43a79355b1bf\">Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children</a>, or WIC benefits, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-to-release-farm-aid-frozen-by-shutdown-e338d9ce\">farm aid</a> earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p>The government of Pennsylvania and other state governments can pick up the costs of the program for November with their own state budget stabilization funds, also known as “<a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-state-rainy-day-funds-and-how-do-they-work\">rainy day funds</a>.” Pennsylvania’s rainy day fund holds <a href=\"https://www.patreasury.gov/newsroom/archive/2024/9-25-RDF.html\">more than $7 billion</a> – well above what’s needed to cover its SNAP benefits for November. <a href=\"https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/virginia-emergency-plan-for-snap-food-benefits-oct-24-2025\">Some states</a> have already committed to doing this.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268337/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Félice Lê-Scherban is the Philadelphia site principal investigator of Children’s HealthWatch.

OK? We’re going to kill them. You know, they’re going to be, like, dead,” President Donald Trump said in late October 2025 of U.S. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/22/us-strike-pacific-colombia-drug-boat/\">military strikes on boats</a> in the Caribbean Sea north of Venezuela. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration asserted without providing any evidence that the boats were carrying illegal drugs. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/28/drug-boat-strike-mexico-pacific-hegseth/\">Fourteen boats</a> that the administration alleged were being operated by drug traffickers have <a href=\"https://www.wola.org/analysis/facts-to-inform-the-debate-about-the-u-s-governments-anti-drug-offensive-in-the-americas/\">been struck, killing 43 people</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 24, the administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/26/us-military-ships-planes-venezuela/\">began a substantial military buildup</a> in the region. The Pentagon moved the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and some of its strike group, along with several other naval ships, to the Caribbean and moved F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This is the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/10/venezuela-trump-caribbean-boats-maduro/684690/\">largest U.S. naval deployment in the Caribbean Sea</a> since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. </p>\n\n<p>According to the White House, the naval buildup and strikes on boats in international waters <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-we-know-us-strikes-alleged-drug-boats-caribbean/\">are part of counternarcotics operations</a>. The vessels targeted allegedly belonged to Venezuelan drug smugglers, though the administration has produced no evidence that there were drugs on the boats, or what type. <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trumps-drug-boat-strikes-venezuela-rcna239354\">Trump has named fentanyl as one of them</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At times the president and some of his advisers have referred to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/trump-drug-boat-venezuela-strike.html\">operators and occupants of the boats as “narco-terrorists</a>.” But they have offered no explanation why the people would be considered terrorists. </p>\n\n<p>The president and his advisers’ own words have also indicated that the larger intentions of the administration <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo\">could be to topple</a> the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. </p>\n\n<p>But as a former <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/jeffrey-fields/\">political-military analyst and former senior adviser</a> at the Department of Defense, I find it hard to discern a coherent strategy or objective.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A map showing the deployment of US Navy ships in the Caribbean, north of Venezuela.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698973/original/file-20251028-56-9jrkh8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The U.S. deployed its largest warship, the USS Gerald R.

Venezuela <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo\">is not a major producer</a> of fentanyl or cocaine. The major cocaine trafficking routes are <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-10-27/drug-boats-carrying-colombian-cocaine-to-the-us-use-pacific-route-more-than-the-caribbean-one.html\">in the Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Typically, the U.S. Coast Guard stops vessels suspected of carrying illegal drugs in international waters. In 2025, the Coast Guard has interdicted a <a href=\"https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_fae20b33-c691-406a-97b3-e6d451b05cb8.html\">record amount</a> of illegal drugs and precursor chemicals in the Caribbean. It is notable that the amount of methamphetamine precursor chemicals interdicted <a href=\"https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_fae20b33-c691-406a-97b3-e6d451b05cb8.html\">far exceeds</a> that of fentanyl. </p>\n\n<p>After interdiction, the Coast Guard typically begins a process that adheres to legal strictures, detaining the crew and eventually turning them over to a U.S. law enforcement agency. </p>\n\n<p>But the Trump strikes have summarily killed most of the people on the boats and presumably destroyed any of the alleged illicit drugs. Many observers and legal experts have said <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-experts-say-us-strikes-against-venezuela-international-waters-amount-2025-10-21/\">the killings amount to murder</a>. </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Trump’s preoccupation with Venezuela</h2>\n\n<p>Trump has had a fixation with <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/24/dhs-deports-tren-de-aragua-gang-members-sexual-predators-and-violent-criminals\">the Venezuelan gang</a> Tren de Aragua for some time, adding to his administration’s focus on Venezuela. </p>\n\n<p>The administration <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/\">designated Tren de Aragua</a> a terrorist organization in January, along with several other drug cartels. But the White House statement announcing the designation made no mention of any behavior or activity that would constitute terrorism. </p>\n\n<p>Under U.S. law, terrorism <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331\">is defined as politically motivated violence</a>, usually targeting a civilian population, intended to bring about political change. The terrorist designation allows the government to pursue actions such as seizing assets and imposing travel restrictions on those appearing on the list of <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations\">Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But the designation of a criminal gang with no clear political ideology or objectives mischaracterizes the group. That calls into question some of the White House’s motivations. </p>\n\n<p>Then there’s the odd incident of the covert operation that wasn’t covert.</p>\n\n<p>In early October, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html\">The New York Times reported</a> that Trump had authorized covert operations in Venezuela and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html\">authorized the CIA</a> to conduct “lethal strikes” inside the country.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cia-covert-operations-venezuela-ecb477ac7f07d5beaf48d44dee75c5e5\">Trump confirmed that he had indeed authorized</a> covert action. Yet the defining feature of a covert operation is that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=50-USC-175183847-1584354847&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=\">the role of the government is hidden</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s fixation on Venezuela goes back to his first term, when he also had Maduro’s regime in his sights. The administration eventually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/us/politics/trump-cartels-venezuela-what-we-know.html\">charged Maduro with leading the Cartel de los Soles</a> – Cartel of the Suns – an informal criminal network tied to high-level Venezuelan military officials believed to have conducted drug trafficking into the U.S. The White House has also claimed that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html\">Maduro controls Tren de Aragua</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Independent observers assert that opposition leader Edmundo González Urrutia <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/instability-venezuela\">handily won</a> the 2024 presidential election. The government-controlled National Electoral Council, however, declared Maduro the winner. If the White House has greater intentions in Venezuela, such as regime change, which some anonymous officials <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/venezuela-cocaine-trafficking-routes-trump\">have suggested</a>, Trump has tipped off Maduro to be vigilant. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7m6vmx4nEs?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump won’t seek a war declaration from Congress over his Venezuela-focused actions: ‘We’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country.’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Thorny issues</h2>\n\n<p>If the goal of the administration is interdiction of dangerous illicit drugs like cocaine, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/world/americas/venezuela-drug-boat-trump-us.html\">Colombia is a much bigger source</a>. Venezuela acts mainly as a minor trans-shipment conduit rather than a producer.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of mitigating the effects of drugs and narcotics in the United States, multiple studies over decades have found that measures taken to decrease demand in the U.S. rather than supply-side interdiction <a href=\"https://www.wola.org/analysis/facts-to-inform-the-debate-about-the-u-s-governments-anti-drug-offensive-in-the-americas/\">are more effective</a> in reducing harm. </p>\n\n<p>With little public information to suggest an overall strategy or objective, legal problems related to the maritime strikes become apparent. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/politics/trump-weighs-strikes-targeting-cartels-inside-venezuela\">has said</a> that the activities were a “counter drug operation.” But he went further in saying that instead of interdicting the boats, they would be blown up.  </p>\n\n<p>The method of interdiction and destruction of the boats and lives of those involved by a military strike presents problems, especially in terms of U.S. armed forces performing law enforcement duties. This would be proscribed by the Posse Comitatus Act, <a href=\"https://policy.defense.gov/portals/11/Documents/hdasa/references/6_USC_466.pdf#:%7E:text=of%20the%20Posse%20Comitatus%20Act%20(1)%20Section,by%20the%20Constitution%20or%20Act%20of%20Congress.\">which prohibits</a> federal armed forces from performing law enforcement activities.</p>\n\n<p>As for actions targeting Venezuela, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-drug-traffickers-congress-venezuela\">has said</a> he would not ask Congress for a declaration of war but would notify it of any ground operation.  </p>\n\n<p>The 1973 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/93/statute/STATUTE-87/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf\">War Powers Act</a>, which requires the president to notify Congress before hostilities and brief it afterward, would apply to this situation. But almost every president since its passing <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/does-the-president-need-congress-to-approve-military-actions-in-iran\">has ignored it</a> at some point. </p>\n\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/83/text\">some Republicans</a> in Congress have objected to the military actions so far, the Senate in early October <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-war-powers-trump-venezuela-boat-strikes/#\">voted down</a> a resolution that would have prevented further strikes in the Caribbean. </p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration continues to depict its activities in international waters as a military operation and the smugglers as enemy combatants. Most <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/121844/trump-notice-drug-cartels/\">legal experts dismiss</a> this and characterize the strikes as extrajudicial killings. </p>\n\n<p>In reply to a flippant and profane response from Vice President JD Vance about the killings, Republican Senator Rand Paul <a href=\"https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1964494191783714933\">wrote on social media</a>, “Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation?? What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial.”  </p>\n\n<p>If Trump and his advisers like Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are taken at their word in scattered statements on the activities around Venezuela, many questions remain, such as why the boats are being destroyed and their occupants killed rather than interdicted.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268363/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jeffrey Fields receives funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.</span></em></p>",

Rather, he will be sitting down the with the chief representative of the United States’ “pacing threat.”</p>\n\n<p>In the Pentagon’s lexicon, China has increasingly been presented as a “<a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2845661/china-remains-pacing-challenge-for-us-pentagon-press-secretary-says/\">pacing challenge</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/10/china-pacing-threat-army-secretary-sayswhile-backing-trumps-homeland-defense-push/408806/\">pacing threat</a>” − that is, a great-power rival against which a nation measures its strength, shapes its strategy and directs its resources across every domain of national power. </p>\n\n<p>The phrase and concept has risen in military and academic circles <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=pacing+threat%2Cpacing+challenge&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3\">since the turn of the 21st century</a>. Its use in Washington to describe China dates to at least 2020, when Trump’s then–Secretary of Defense Mark Esper <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/2326863/esper-discusses-moves-needed-to-counter-chinas-malign-strategy/\">used it in a speech in Honolulu</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But what does it mean? For a country to be seen as a pacing threat, it must be a rising yet already near-peer whose capabilities and ambitions directly challenge the dominant country’s global position. A pacing threat doesn’t merely aspire to catch up; it sets the tempo of competition.</p>\n\n<p>Esper’s successor in the Biden administration, Lloyd J. Austin III, <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2641068/official-talks-dod-policy-role-in-chinese-pacing-threat-integrated-deterrence/\">continued to call China a “pacing threat</a>,” explaining: “It means that China is the only country that can pose a systemic challenge to the United States in the sense of challenging us economically, technologically, politically and militarily.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use of “pacing threat/challenge” has grown since 2009 (Ngram)</strong></p>\n\n<iframe name=\"ngram_chart\" src=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=pacing+threat,pacing+challenge&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The significance goes beyond rhetoric. By <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/10/china-pacing-threat-army-secretary-sayswhile-backing-trumps-homeland-defense-push/408806/\">defining China</a> in these terms, Washington reorients its entire defense establishment around a new strategic benchmark. The U.S.’s defense planning, industrial policy and global posture now revolve around a single question − how to keep up with and, if necessary, outpace Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States government signals <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/meink_opening_statement.pdf\">to its military leaders</a> and industrial partners that a specific country is a “pacing threat,” it is giving them a yardstick by which to judge every dollar spent, every sailor or pilot assigned and every hour of training and preparation. </p>\n\n<h2>Pacing threats, increasing risks</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/News/Display/Article/4129357/adapting-us-defense-strategy-to-great-power-competition/\">risk of focusing</a> so intently on one foe is, of course, that there is more than one potential adversary out there. And the concept of a pacing challenge shouldn’t imply that China is Washington’s only competitor or potential enemy. </p>\n\n<p>Other rivals remain in the mix, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and a range of smaller militant groups, that could cause major problems for Washington with or without China’s involvement. </p>\n\n<p>The danger for the U.S. is that in designating China its only pacing threat, it could leave blind spots elsewhere. And the objective for a U.S. leader is not simply to be ready for a potential war with China but to be ready for the next crisis wherever it may emerge.</p>\n\n<p>This goal is complicated by <a href=\"https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/News/Display/Article/4217911/the-next-national-defense-strategy-mission-based-force-planning/\">a second risk</a>: the urge to plan for the future at the expense of the present. It is one thing for the U.S. Navy to build a fleet and the Air Force to design a missile for 2035 to ensure that it “outpaces” Chinese innovation. But it is another to have the capability to deter or address, if necessary, a crisis or conflict in 2025. </p>\n\n<p>Developing a long-term force to match or surpass China is an important objective to U.S. political and military leaders, but not at the expense of current capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>If the United States is intent on remaining the world’s predominant economic, diplomatic and military force, then it must focus on both – but that is easier said than done.</p>\n\n<h2>Is China already ahead?</h2>\n\n<p>There are some who believe that America’s pacing threat has already outpaced its rival.</p>\n\n<p>The United States <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-outpacing-us-defense-industrial-base\">already lags behind China</a> in the scale and output of its defense-industrial base – particularly in the quantity of ships, missiles and other military hardware it can produce and field at speed.</p>\n\n<p>China is building warships at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmnpg31xlo\">a rate unseen</a> in the U.S. for decades. And it has an industrial ecosystem that can deliver on new programs and scale up in a crisis. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-us-navys-shipbuilding-crisis-is-real/\">American factories</a> face labor shortages, a lack of modern shipyards and glacial acquisition timelines. </p>\n\n<p>If the U.S. is intent on fielding better military assets in the future, it needs them to upscale at a speed that can deter China. In other words, America’s deterrence to any pacing threat needs to start at the factory gate.</p>\n\n<h2>A contest of speed, not size</h2>\n\n<p>Facing China as a pacing threat will start with an honest U.S. accounting of the type of competition in which it is engaged. This is not merely a rivalry of fleets or firepower but <a href=\"https://csbaonline.org/uploads/documents/CSBA8352_(Decisive_Decade_Report)_FINAL_web.pdf\">a contest of tempo</a> − who can innovate faster, build smarter and field more flexibly to shape a world in motion. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A large ship is seen in front of a city landscape.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698959/original/file-20251028-56-5d7v69.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The aircraft carrier Liaoning sets out for sea trial at Dalian shipyard in China on Feb. 29, 2024.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/aircraft-carrier-liaoning-sets-for-sea-trial-at-dalian-news-photo/2047730488?adppopup=true\">VCG/VCG via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>If the U.S. is to outpace China, it will likely need to reconnect its economic and industrial base to its defense posture and regenerate the productive capacity that made America <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/building-a-new-american-arsenal/\">the world’s arsenal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But that task is far harder for democracies, where political cycles, fiscal constraints and public skepticism about militarization often slow the mobilization of national power.</p>\n\n<p>Complicating the matter is the fact that the next great arsenal will be defined not just in steel but in <a href=\"https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/industry-spotlights/shaping-the-future-of-the-defense-industry\">data, design and decision</a>. Here, too, China at present appears to be gaining an upper hand. A September report by the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/23/how-china-is-outperforming-the-united-states-in-critical-technologies/\">assessed that China was now</a> “dramatically outperforming the United States in the vast majority of critical technological fields.”</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. will not stay ahead of its pacing threat by meeting China ship for ship or system for system.

In the Catholic Church, <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_pro_20190629_forointerno_en.html\">there are no exceptions</a> – and <a href=\"https://www.usccb.org/committees/religious-liberty/religious-liberty-backgrounder-seal-confessional\">the penalty for disclosure is excommunication</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In mid-October, however, Washington state announced <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/washington-state-cuts-mandate-priests-break-confessional-seal\">it would not enforce the mandatory reporting requirement</a> for information learned during confidential rites. On Oct. 14, 2025, a federal court approved <a href=\"https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/washington-state-reaches-agreement-preserve-key-portions-law-requiring-clergy\">the state’s agreements</a> with <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26002542-etienne-v-ferguson-complaint/\">groups of Catholic</a> <a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/pdfs/gqzakw-us-dis-waed-2-25cv209-d70336483e1838-complaint-against-all-defendants-filing-fee-405-re.pdf\">and Orthodox clergy</a> who had sued to block that part of the law, arguing it violated their religious freedom. The U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1404131/dl\">had also intervened</a>, claiming the law discriminates against Catholics. </p>\n\n<p>Reporting laws can be complicated by what is known as “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privilege\">legal privilege</a>”: the rights granted to certain people, such as spouses or lawyers of suspects, to keep confidentiality by refusing to cooperate with an investigation. As <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/faculty-listing/detail/ann-murphy-jd-ma-8f4a6ef5\">a law professor</a>, I have written often about clergy privilege, as well as other legal privileges. The attorney-client privilege <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/449/383/\">is the oldest</a>, <a href=\"https://law-journals-books.vlex.com/vid/dead-men-lawyers-tell-tales-survives-52675488\">dating to the 16th century</a>, but the “priest-penitent privilege” has a long history as well. </p>\n\n<h2>US landscape</h2>\n\n<p>It was not until the 1960s that U.S. states began using <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/vlr/vol59/iss6/5/?utm_source=digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu%2Fvlr%2Fvol59%2Fiss6%2F5&amp;utm_medium=PDF&amp;utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages\">mandatory reporting laws to protect children from abuse</a>.

However, most have an exemption for clergy who learn about abuse during a rite or prayer. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/states-weigh-child-abuse-reporting-vs-clergys-duty-of-confidentiality/\">Several states do not have such an exemption</a>. However, the text of their laws <a href=\"https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2025/05/12/seal-confession-law-washington-separation-church-state-250618/\">do not specifically mention religious leaders</a>, which may be why they did not provoke as much controversy as Washington’s bill. For example, North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_7B/GS_7B-310.pdf\">requires “any person</a>” who suspects abuse to report it.</p>\n\n<p>Before SB 5375, Washington excluded clergy entirely from <a href=\"https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c217.pdf\">mandatory reporting requirements</a> that apply to many other professionals, such as medical professionals, therapists and school personnel. </p>\n\n<p>Now, under the October agreements filed in court, clergy are included in the list of mandatory reporters, but they are not required to report anything they learn about during a confession or sacred rite. The Vatican also instructs bishops to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/world/europe/vatican-new-sex-abuse-rules.html\">report abuse by priests, deacons and prelates to civil authorities</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>2 key issues</h2>\n\n<p>There are two issues at play in clergy reporting laws.</p>\n\n<p>One is whether clergy must take the initiative to report abuse that they learn about through their professional duties.</p>\n\n<p>The other is whether clergy members have <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privilege\">an evidentiary privilege</a> – that is, the right to refuse to testify in court, or to answer questions during investigations, in order to protect their parishioners’ privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Although mandatory reporting and clergy privilege are separate issues, both may apply in particular cases. </p>\n\n<p>In 2021, for example, three children sued officials in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its <a href=\"https://www.appeals2.az.gov/Decisions/SA20220047Memo.pdf\">failure to report their father’s abuse to authorities</a>. The children ultimately <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/race-religion-social-justice/2023-11-08/arizona-court-dismisses-child-sex-abuse-suit-against-the-lds-church\">lost their negligence case against the church</a> because, although Arizona had a mandatory reporting statute, it also <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/03620.htm\">has an exception</a> for information learned through confession or other confidential communication.</p>\n\n<p>Washington state recognizes a “<a href=\"https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=5.60.060\">priest-penitent privilege</a>.” Therefore, a priest who hears about abuse during confession may refuse to divulge what he’s heard if called into a legal proceeding. Originally, however, Washington’s new law would have <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1408156/dl?inline\">required clergy to make an initial report to law enforcement</a>, breaking the “seal of confession” – but they could have refused to cooperate with the resulting investigation. </p>\n\n<p>Now, under the stipulations, clergy do not need to make an initial report if they learn of abuse through a confidential rite such as confession. In contrast, other individuals who have a legal privilege under Washington state law – for example, a spousal privilege or a physician privilege – must still report in the event of child abuse. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An older man in a suit holds his head in his hand as he sits at a table with a younger man taking notes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695497/original/file-20251009-56-3lg2ba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Attorney-client privilege is intended to protect someone’s right to accurate legal advice.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businessman-discussion-and-sign-business-the-royalty-free-image/1184110598?phrase=attorney%20client&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Nitat Termmee/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>History of privilege</h2>\n\n<p>Under English law, the origin of most early American law, <a href=\"https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-73-number-1/forgive-us-our-sins-the-inadequacies-of-the-clergy-penitent-privilege/\">the “minister’s privilege</a>,” as it was called, was not recognized after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., a clergy privilege was first recognized in 1813. In <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/people-v-philips/\">People v. Philips</a>, a Catholic priest in New York was summoned to testify about the return of some stolen jewelry – which apparently he required a parishioner to do, after hearing about the theft during confession. The court reasoned that requiring the priest to testify about what the parishioner revealed would <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol23/iss1/3/\">violate his religious liberty</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Four years later, in another New York case, <a href=\"https://history.nycourts.gov/case/people-v-smith/\">People v. Smith</a>, the court found that a minister did <a href=\"https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/priest-penitent-privilege/\">not have grounds for a privilege</a> because, as a Protestant, he was not bound by the same “seal of confession” rules as Catholic priests. In 1828, the New York Legislature passed a statute broadening the privilege to include all ministers and priests.</p>\n\n<p>The general theory of all testimonial privileges is that it protects confidential communications that society wishes to foster. Attorney-client privilege, for example, exists so that the client may receive the best advice. The benefit of a privilege – the right to legal representation or the right to the free exercise of religion – is considered more important than society’s quest for truth.</p>\n\n<p>There is a legal maxim that “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-635_o7jq.pdf\">the public has a right to every man’s evidence</a>.” Privileges are <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/colorado/codce/1:2011cv02179/127919/88/\">an exception to this rule</a> and thus are <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol71/iss4/16/\">narrowly applied by courts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, 1 in 4 children <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470337/\">experience child abuse or neglect</a>. If society believes that information about child abuse, even if disclosed during a religious rite, is more important than shielding that information, then the clergy privilege should be eliminated or weakened in such cases.</p>\n\n<p>Religious freedom is a core constitutional guarantee. The question is how society should balance these two important interests.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264002/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ann M.

A ripple in the jet stream known as an <a href=\"http://noaa.gov/jetstream/upper-air-charts/basic-wave-patterns\">atmospheric trough</a> steered the hurricane to the northeast and into the Jamaican coast.</p>\n\n<p>Melissa’s snail’s pace of about 2 mph was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-23-0229.1\">rare but not unheard of</a>. <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145139/tropical-cyclones-are-stalling-more\">Slow storms</a> like Melissa are more common in October, as steering currents are often very weak or pushing in opposite directions, which can trap a tropical cyclone in place. Similar steering currents affected <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL142016_Matthew.pdf\">Hurricane Matthew</a> in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Tragically, stalled tropical cyclones often bring prolonged rainfall, winds, flash flooding and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-hurricane-storm-surge-and-why-can-it-be-so-catastrophic-145369\">storm surge</a> with them. The wind and downpours can be extreme for mountain communities, as their high topography enhances local rainfall that can <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/10/3/2008jhm1057_1.xml\">trigger mudslides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL152017_Maria.pdf\">flooding</a>, as Jamaica saw from Melissa.</p>\n\n<h2>Improving storm track forecasting</h2>\n\n<p>Meteorologists generally understand how atmospheric steering currents guide tropical cyclones, yet forecasting these wind patterns <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0136.1\">remains a challenge</a>. Depending on the atmospheric setup, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-23-0169.1\">certain hurricanes</a> can be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-22-0112.1\">harder to forecast</a> than others, as changes to steering currents can be subtle. </p>\n\n<p>New approaches to hurricane track forecasting include using machine learning models, such as <a href=\"https://deepmind.google.com/science/weatherlab\">Google DeepMind</a>, which <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bmcnoldy.bsky.social/post/3m3sftncjj224\">outperformed</a> many traditional models in forecasting storm tracks this hurricane season. Rather than solving a complex set of equations to make a forecast, DeepMind looks at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.10772\">statistics of previous hurricane tracks</a> to infer the path of a current storm. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1982840670068044004&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omao.noaa.gov/aircraft-operations/noaa-hurricane-hunters\">NOAA Hurricane Hunter</a> reconnaissance data can also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-20-0174.1\">accelerate progress</a> in predicting tropical cyclone paths. Recent tests show how <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-23-0055.1\">accounting for specific measurements</a> from within a hurricane can improve forecasts. Certain <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-23-0084.1\">flight patterns</a> that Hurricane Hunters and <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/101/2/bams-d-19-0169.1.xml\">drones</a> fly through strong hurricanes can also improve predictions of a storm’s path. </p>\n\n<p>Scientists and engineers aim to further improve hurricane track and intensity forecasts through <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/2025-hurricane-field-program/\">research into storm behavior</a> and <a href=\"https://wpo.noaa.gov/the-hurricane-analysis-and-forecast-system-hafs/\">improving hurricane models</a> to better inform the public when danger is on the way.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268183/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ethan Murray receives funding from the Office of Naval Research and National Science Foundation.

They have also begun to transform the way people grow food.</p>\n\n<p>In a new study published in the journal Science, we show that use of agricultural drones has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ady1791\">spread extremely rapidly around the world</a>. In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0YnHJLcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">our</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f1QlEPkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">research</a> as social scientists studying agriculture and rural development, we set out to document where agricultural drones have taken off around the world, what they are doing, and why they have traveled so far so fast. We also explored what these changes mean for farmers, the environment, the public and governments.</p>\n\n<h2>From toys to farm tools</h2>\n\n<p>Just a few years ago, agricultural drones were expensive, small and difficult to use, limiting their appeal to farmers. In contrast, today’s models can be flown immediately after purchase and <a href=\"https://www.realagriculture.com/2025/07/dji-launches-three-new-agriculture-drone-models/\">carry loads weighing up to 220 pounds</a> (100 kg) – the weight of two sacks of fertilizer. </p>\n\n<p>Their prices vary from country to country due to taxes, tariffs and shipping costs. In the U.S., a drone owner can expect to spend <a href=\"https://nuwayag.com/collections/drones\">US$20,000 to $30,000</a> for the same equipment that a farmer in China could buy for less than <a href=\"https://www.nongji1958.com/node/45578\">$10,000</a>. However, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5464131\">most farmers hire service providers</a>, small businesses that supply drones and pilots for a fee, making them easy and relatively affordable to use.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_XkHEUIi5Q?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A promotional video for the DJI Agras T100 agricultural drone, which can carry a maximum load of 220 pounds (100 kg).</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Agricultural drones are now akin to flying tractors – multifunctional machines that can perform numerous tasks using different hardware attachments. Common uses for drones on farms include spraying crops, spreading fertilizer, sowing seeds, transporting produce, dispensing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCoibCLypjW/\">fish feeds</a>, painting greenhouses, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/drones-finding-cattle-where-cowboys-cannot-reach.html\">monitoring livestock locations and well-being</a>, mapping field topography and drainage, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atech.2024.100719\">measuring crop health</a>. This versatility makes drones valuable for growing numerous crops, on farms of all sizes.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"PPKXh\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PPKXh/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Technological leapfrogging</h2>\n\n<p>We estimated the number of agricultural drones operating in some of the world’s leading agricultural countries by scouring online news and trade publications in many different languages. This effort revealed where agricultural drones have already taken off around the world. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, most agricultural technology – tractors, for example – has spread from <a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/227291468766760286\">high-income countries to middle- and then lower-income ones over the course of many decades</a>. Drones partially reversed and dramatically accelerated this pattern, diffusing first from East Asia to Southeast Asia, then to Latin America, and finally to North America and Europe. Their use in higher-income regions is more limited but is accelerating rapidly in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>China leads the world in agricultural drone manufacturing and adoption. In 2016, a Chinese company introduced the <a href=\"https://talosdrones.com/blogs/blog/dji-agras-history-from-mg-1-to-t50\">first agriculture-specific quadcopter model</a>. There are now <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5464131\">more than 250,000</a> agricultural drones reported to be in use there. Other middle-income countries have also been enthusiastic adopters. For instance, drones were used on <a href=\"https://mddb.apec.org/Documents/2023/TPTWG/AEG-TM1/23_tptwg_aeg_tm1_010.pdf\">30% of Thailand’s farmland</a> in 2023, up from almost none in 2019, mainly by spraying pesticides and spreading fertilizers.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., the number of <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download\">agricultural drones registered with the Federal Aviation Administration</a> leaped from about 1,000 in January 2024 to around 5,500 in mid-2025. <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FAA-2025-1908-2754\">Industry reports</a> suggest those numbers substantially underreport U.S. drone use because some owners seek to avoid the complex registration process. Agricultural drones in the U.S. are used mainly for spraying crops such as corn and soy, especially in areas that are difficult to reach with tractors or crop-dusting aircraft.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"LztKi\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LztKi/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Safer, but not risk-free</h2>\n\n<p>In countries such as China, Thailand and Vietnam, millions of smallholder farmers have upgraded from the dangerous and tiring job of applying agrochemicals by hand with backpack sprayers to using some of the most cutting-edge technology in the world, often <a href=\"https://talosdrones.com/collections/drones\">using the same models that are popular in the U.S</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Shifting from applying chemicals with backpack sprayers to drones substantially <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.23551\">reduces the risk of direct exposure to toxins for farmers and farmworkers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, because drones usually spray from <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2021/04/report-on-the-state-of-the-knowledge-literature-review-on-unmanned-aerial-spray-systems-in-agriculture_ee9be37f/9240f8eb-en.pdf\">a height of at least 6 feet (2 meters)</a>, if used improperly, they can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-007-9036-5\">spread droplets containing pesticides or herbicides</a> to neighboring farms, waterways or bystanders. That can damage crops and endanger people and nature. </p>\n\n<h2>Saving labor or displacing it?</h2>\n\n<p>Drones save farmers time and money. They reduce the need for smallholders – people who farm less than 5 acres (2 hectares), which account for <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/284771480330980968/pdf/110543-Handbook-Working-with-Smallholders.pdf\">85% of farms globally</a> – to do dangerous and tiring manual spraying and spreading work on their own farms. They also remove the need to hire workers to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>By eliminating some of the last remaining physically demanding work in farming, drones may also help make agriculture more attractive to rural youth, who are often disillusioned with the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/408708f0-82dc-418e-b92b-e2d7ec0cd2e6/content#page=114.20\">drudgery of traditional farming</a>. In addition, drones create new skilled employment opportunities in rural areas for pilots, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP6w45taHI8&amp;t=1s\">many of whom are young people</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the downside, using drones could displace workers who currently earn a living from crop spraying. For instance, according to <a href=\"https://www.agricultural-engineering.eu/landtechnik/article/view/3318/3794\">one estimate from China</a>, drones can cover between 10 and 25 acres (4 to 10 hectares) of farmland per hour when spraying pesticides. That is equivalent to the effort of between 30 and 100 workers spraying manually. Governments may need to find ways to help displaced workers find new jobs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person pours liquid into a tank attached to a drone, while standing near a large field.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698802/original/file-20251027-56-umnl9i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An agricultural worker fills a drone tank with pesticide spray at a farm in Brazil.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brazilan-agricultural-worker-fills-the-drones-tank-with-news-photo/1238580672\">Mateus Bonomi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Sky’s the limit</h2>\n\n<p>Drones spray and spread fertilizers and seeds <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1303669\">evenly and efficiently</a>, so that less is wasted.

This outcome is a holy grail for agricultural scientists, who refer to it as “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1234485\">sustainable intensification</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>However, much of the evidence so far on yield gains from drone-assisted farming is anecdotal, or based on small studies or <a href=\"https://www1.djicdn.com/cms_uploads/ckeditor/attachments/9171/03e81f9a23cf4df447b66c91c43d929a.pdf\">industry reports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The drone revolution is reshaping farming faster than almost any technology before it. In just five years, millions of farmers around the world have embraced drones. Early signs point to big benefits: greater efficiency, safer working conditions and improved rural livelihoods. But the full picture isn’t clear yet.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265154/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But behind every headline, countless stories have gone untold about the real-world impacts that these changes will have on everyday people.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://news.gsu.edu/2025/08/26/greta-massetti-noted-global-health-and-violence-epidemiology-researcher-joins-school-of-public-health-as-department-chair/\">public health expert</a> who spent 18 years as a scientist at the CDC. I see the systematic dismantling of the agency as a significant risk to the country’s ability to keep Americans safe and give medical professionals the data needed to keep them that way.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my time at the CDC was spent in the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, one of the hardest hit of the agency’s programs. The center has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/cdc-layoffs-hamper-injury-prevention\">lost more than half of its staff</a> through layoffs alone and as many as two-thirds when other reductions are accounted for.</p>\n\n<h2>Injuries affect people of all ages</h2>\n\n<p>More Americans die from injuries and violence in the <a href=\"https://wisqars.cdc.gov/lcd/\">first half of life than from any other cause</a>, including cancer, HIV or the flu. These include suicide, overdose, homicide and unintentional injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The mass layoffs that the <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-firings-government-shutdown-hhs/\">Trump administration has carried out</a> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/cdc-layoffs-hamper-injury-prevention\">in 2025</a> struck at the core of the injury center’s programs on violence prevention and eliminated the work being done to prevent unintentional injuries like drowning, traumatic brain injuries, falls in older adults and motor vehicle crashes. </p>\n\n<p>As of late October, only the CDC programs focused on overdose prevention, suicide and the National Violent Deaths Reporting System remain <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/cdc-layoffs-hamper-injury-prevention\">in the injury center</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Unintentional injuries <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury-violence-prevention/economics/index.html#\">cost the U.S. $4.5 trillion annually</a> and directly affect workforce and community stability. This includes <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7048a1-h.pdf\">$323 billion in medical care</a> as well as costs from lost work productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Every unintentional injury represents a preventable tragedy — a fall, a crash, a drowning — that alters the course of a life. Like me, many Americans are eager for information about keeping their loved ones safe.</p>\n\n<h2>Making youth sports safer</h2>\n\n<p>One critical injury center program that was cut from CDC in April is its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heads-up/headsup/index.html\">HEADS UP program</a>, which is aimed at preventing and reducing head trauma. The program includes online courses for youth coaches, health care providers, schools, athletic trainers and others that provide information about how to protect kids from concussions and other serious brain injuries. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/traumatic-brain-injury/index.html\">Traumatic brain injury</a> affects <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7048a3.htm\">more than 230,000 people</a> in the U.S. A traumatic brain injury is a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head, or a penetrating head injury. </p>\n\n<p>People of all ages are at risk of experiencing a traumatic brain injury. For young people, concussions from contact sports account for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6810a2.htm\">45% of all emergency department visits</a> for a traumatic brain injury each year. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Older female doctor in a lab coat examines a young boy who is holding an ice pack to his head.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698995/original/file-20251028-56-bt7uni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Concussions in youth contact sports are the cause of nearly half of all traumatic brain injury emergency room visits annually.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/concerned-emergency-room-doctor-examines-injured-royalty-free-image/800495624?phrase=%20brain%20injuries%20youth%20sports&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">SDI Productions/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>HEADS UP specifically aims to create education and awareness around youth traumatic brain injuries. Currently, 45 states recommend or require HEADS UP materials or training to be used by sports programs and schools in their concussion prevention laws. </p>\n\n<p>The elimination of the CDC’s injury prevention team will undoubtedly result in a loss of progress in preventing these avoidable injuries. It will also leave gaps in states whose coaches are unable to fulfill their training requirements.</p>\n\n<h2>Preventing drownings</h2>\n\n<p>Drowning is the No. 1 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/facts/index.html\">cause of death for children ages 1 to 4</a>, and fatal and nonfatal drownings cost the U.S. $56 billion each year. Drowning deaths have been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7320e1.htm\">increasing steadily among young children since 2019</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/26/the-pools-open-trumps-laid-off-the-team-that-helps-protect-swimmers-00363426\">drowning prevention team was eliminated</a>, the injury center was the only federal public health department focused on preventing drowning. </p>\n\n<p>It did so on a shoestring: With only $2 million annually appropriated by Congress, the team stretched every penny to maximize its impact on public health by strengthening data systems and supporting communities in getting access to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/about/index.html\">lifesaving swimming and water safety skills</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Every drowning death of a young child is a preventable, costly tragedy. </p>\n\n<p>The critical work of the CDC’s drowning prevention team brought critical lifesaving work to communities across America by providing water safety skills and training to <a href=\"https://www.cdcfoundation.org/stories/drowning-prevention-improving-kids-access-swim-lessons\">more than 22,000 children in 2024 alone</a>. At a cost of just $110 per child, teaching a child to swim <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052227\">reduces their risk of drowning by up to 88%</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a hand reaching out of the water for help, with a 'no swimming' sign in the background.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698991/original/file-20251028-66-db54m0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Drowning deaths have been rising in young children.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/hand-of-a-person-drowning-in-water-reaches-royalty-free-illustration/2183022145?phrase=drowning%20deaths&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">fadfebrian/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Keeping older adults safe from falls</h2>\n\n<p>Injuries also affect older adults in significant ways. </p>\n\n<p>Falls are the leading cause of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\">injury and death among adults age 65 and over</a>, and 1 of 4 older adults falls each year. Falls result in hospitalizations, hip fractures and traumatic brain injuries, which can be debilitating and deadly for older adults. </p>\n\n<p>A CDC program known as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/index.html\">STEADI</a> – short for Stopping Early Accidents, Deaths and Injuries – provides <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/patient-resources/index.html\">educational materials to make preventing falls</a> a routine part of clinical care that doctors provide. Staff cuts resulted in the elimination of STEADI. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S. $2 out of every $3 of the $80 billion spent in medical costs on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/ip-2023-045023\">falls are paid by Medicare</a>, representing 9% of the total Medicare spending on older adults. </p>\n\n<p>Strategies aimed at reducing falls in older adults are key to lowering Medicare spending, showing how the critical work of the CDC is essential to reducing health care costs to individuals and taxpayers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A caregiver helps support an elderly woman as she braces herself against two walls.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698997/original/file-20251028-66-27i6xk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">About 9% of Medicare spending in older adults stems from falls.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/caregiver-help-asian-or-elderly-old-woman-sitting-royalty-free-image/2164955285?phrase=falls%20older%20adults&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">sasirin pamai/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Safer roads for drivers and pedestrians</h2>\n\n<p>In the U.S., motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death, killing <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/transportation-safety/about/index.html\">more than 100 people every day</a> and over 40,000 people each year. In 2023, deaths from road crashes resulted in an estimated $457 billion in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/transportation-safety/about/index.html\">medical costs and expenses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Experts at CDC’s injury center developed tools for helping to better track and monitor motor vehicle crash injuries. This work made it possible for states to look at trends in <a href=\"https://knowledgerepository.syndromicsurveillance.org/cdc-pedestrian-motor-vehicle-traffic-injury-v1#\">transportation-related injuries within hours</a> instead of waiting for the <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-estimates-39345-traffic-fatalities-2024#\">previous two- to three-year lag in data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before this program was eliminated by the Trump administration, CDC’s experts created resources for parents of teen drivers like me to keep their teens safe on the road. They also shared information to improve the safety of child passengers and older adult drivers.</p>\n\n<h2>Turning complex data into usable information</h2>\n\n<p>When health care providers and others face questions about keeping children and adults safe, they have long turned to the CDC to translate complex information into practical, actionable advice. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, CDC’s clinical guidance helped <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/traumatic-brain-injury/hcp/clinical-guidance/index.html#\">improve diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injuries</a> in children and teens and has guided doctors in emergency rooms and clinics to provide consistent, high-quality care to their patients. CDC experts also provided <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/php/data-quality/drowning-submersion-syndrome.html\">data on emergency department visits due to drowning injuries</a> and practical <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/STEADI-Assessment-30Sec-508.pdf\">resources for doctors and pharmacists</a> to identify patients at risk of falls. </p>\n\n<p>As a public health expert, I see the deep cuts to CDC’s injury prevention programs as serious threats to public health broadly. As a mother, sister, daughter and neighbor, I worry that my loved ones and their doctors will not have the information and resources they need to stay healthy and injury-free.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267531/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Greta Massetti does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Better words would be “stability” and “productivity” – and this was by the founder’s design.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Black and white portrait of man with mustache wearing three-piece suit\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=742&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=742&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=742&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=932&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=932&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699009/original/file-20251028-56-xdwp8v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=932&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Milton Hershey founded Hershey Chocolate and built up the town of Hershey, Pa., for his employees.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/milton-hershey-founded-hershey-chocolate-as-well-as-built-news-photo/514880580\">Bettman/Bettman Collection via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>When Milton Hershey entered the confection industry in the 1880s, violent clashes between corporations and labor roiled American society. Hershey imagined a better way: <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09992-7.html\">paternalistic capitalism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 1900s, he built a chocolate factory and planned community out in the farms and pastures of central Pennsylvania. Instead of offering men and women wage-earning jobs and nothing else, he took care of his workers. They owned nice homes and benefited from a generous array of free or subsidized services and amenities: snow removal, garbage collection, trolley lines, good schools, a junior college, zoo, museum, sports arena, library, community center and theater.</p>\n\n<p>They even had their own <a href=\"https://www.hersheypark.com/about-us\">amusement park</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But this was a reciprocal relationship. In return, employees were expected to work hard, exhibit loyalty, practice clean living and refrain from labor agitation. With the exception of a strike during the Great Depression, the company and town lived in harmony. Milton Hershey called the place an “<a href=\"https://www.americanheritage.com/sweetest-place-earth\">industrial utopia</a>,” and residents largely agreed.</p>\n\n<p>“Moving to Hershey,” one recalled, “<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/42061197\">was like moving to paradise</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Harmony also defined Hershey’s relations with Mars. At the time, Hershey produced only solid chocolate – think of Hershey bars and Kisses. In contrast, Frank Mars’ company specialized in chocolate-covered snacks, suches Snickers or Milky Way, in which milk chocolate is poured over nuts, caramel or nougat.</p>\n\n<p>Where did that chocolate coating come from? </p>\n\n<p>Hershey, of course. </p>\n\n<p>In those days, Mars was a client, not a rival. Without competition, Hershey enjoyed the luxury of not having to worry about market share. Amazingly, the company did not advertise under Milton Hershey and continued this policy after his death in 1945.   </p>\n\n<h2>Hershey in crisis</h2>\n\n<p>Everything changed in 1964. The catalyst for change was Forrest Mars, the founder’s hard-charging son who was a true disrupter.</p>\n\n<p>After seizing control of his father’s company, Forrest Mars set his sights on dethroning Hershey. As reporter and author <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/42061197\">Joël Glenn Brenner explains</a>, the younger Mars boldly terminated the partnership with Hershey while ordering his engineers to learn how to make Hershey-caliber chocolate in six months. He also modernized the factory and ordered a surge in advertising, all to wrestle market share away from Hershey, the “<a href=\"https://7051.sydneyplus.com/archive/final/Download.aspx?template=LINK&amp;field=LINKAtt&amp;record=53b76a18-b436-4f75-bc2f-c539edb7bddb&amp;showSave=False\">sleeping giant</a>.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Sepia-toned photograph of woman working large machine in a factory\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699012/original/file-20251028-56-c0lsa5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The production line at the Hershey chocolate factory in 1969.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-production-line-at-the-original-hershey-chocolate-news-photo/1203774036\">Peter Simins/Pix/Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The strategy worked. By the decade’s end, Mars had caught Hershey in terms of market share and pushed the chocolate colossus into crisis. </p>\n\n<p>The good news for Hershey was that it had at the helm two forward-looking leaders, Harold Mohler and Bill Dearden. Though standard practice had always been to hire locally and from within, Mohler and Dearden recruited outsiders with MBAs from Harvard and Wharton to initiate sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing its archaic business practices.</p>\n\n<p>The company opened a public relations office, conducted market research, installed IBM mainframe computers to crunch numbers, retrained its sales force and created a marketing department. Many employees, a new executive joked, were so behind the times that they had thought marketing was “<a href=\"https://7051.sydneyplus.com/archive/final/Download.aspx?template=LINK&amp;field=LINKAtt&amp;record=81e84c8d-5c52-4655-96ad-5af1dacfefe2&amp;showSave=False\">what their wives did … with a shopping cart</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>This effort culminated with the release of the company’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltJ0bC7_PGw\">first TV commercials</a> starting in 1969. The sleeping giant had awoken.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAppjvXWGgU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">An iconic TV commercial for Reese’s, which was purchased by Hershey in the early 1960s.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The company’s next move altered the town forever. As a cost-cutting measure, it terminated the free services and amenities at the core of Milton Hershey’s vision. The era of paternalism was over.</p>\n\n<p>As the company liquidated assets, residents howled in protest.</p>\n\n<p>“It was a very traumatic time for the community,” <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09992-7.html\">one executive recalled</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For residents, the only consolation was that at least the amusement park would stay the same. </p>\n\n<p>Or would it?  </p>\n\n<p>By the late 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09992-7.html\">Hershey Park had degenerated</a> into what one executive called “an iron park with a bunch of clanging rides.” Leadership faced a pivotal decision: renovate the park or close it forever.</p>\n\n<p>The park had such a “rich heritage,” one executive recalled, that to shutter it would “put a stamp of negative feeling within the community.” </p>\n\n<p>The company elected to renovate.  </p>\n\n<h2>Hersheypark’s transformation</h2>\n\n<p>But how to renovate was another matter.  </p>\n\n<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, owners of traditional amusement parks had to think twice before investing in their properties. That was because Disneyland, the nation’s first theme park, had caused a sensation when it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHoiejG_gz8\">debuted in 1955</a>. Its incredible popularity, and the opening of the more spectacular <a href=\"https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/what-attractions-were-open-when-magic-kingdom-debuted-in-1971\">Disney World in 1971</a>, placed pressure on old-fashioned amusement parks everywhere.  </p>\n\n<p>After commissioning a feasibility study, Hershey officials decided to gamble: Instead of fixing up the old amusement park, they would convert it into a Disney-style theme park. To pay for the massive overhaul, they redirected capital earned from the dismantling of Milton Hershey’s paternalism. Reborn as “<a href=\"https://www.hersheypa.com/about-hershey/history/hersheypark-history.php\">Hersheypark” in 1973</a>, the ever-growing complex has become a mecca for chocolate lovers and thrill-ride seekers from across the Northeast.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Pharmacy shelves lined with Halloween candy\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699015/original/file-20251028-66-rets6v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Hershey and Mars products are ubiquitous in trick-or-treat hauls.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/halloween-candy-for-sale-in-walgreens-pharmacy-queens-new-news-photo/2177963378\">Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Every year, Halloween reminds me of this remarkable transformation.

Since many officers have little to no training on how to assess or treat mental illness, these situations can easily become violent. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, for example, <a href=\"https://policeviolencereport.org/\">118 people were killed</a> across the U.S. after police responded to reports of someone having a mental health episode. Such cases can lead to charges of police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>This problem is not new. One of the first cases to receive wide attention and spur reform efforts happened 41 years ago, on Oct. 29, 1984. On that day, a white New York City police officer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/30/nyregion/police-kill-woman-being-evicted-officers-say-she-wielded-a-knife.html\">fatally shot 66-year-old Eleanor Bumpurs</a>, a Black woman. Bumpurs, who lived in public housing and had a history of mental health problems, was killed during an eviction. </p>\n\n<p>Bumpurs’ death ignited one of New York’s most significant social justice campaigns of the 1980s, centering on Black women’s encounters with police. It influenced decades of debate over police response to those with mental illness, which have continued right up to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/nyregion/mamdani-public-safety-plan.html\">New York City’s current mayoral election</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Bumpurs lived across the street from my childhood home, and I was 10 years old when she was killed. In my new book, “<a href=\"https://www.beacon.org/Tell-Her-Story-P2196.aspx\">Tell Her Story: Eleanor Bumpurs &amp; the Police Killing That Galvanized New York City</a>,” I explain how the police shooting of a grandmother roiled my neighborhood and sparked citywide action. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A Black woman wearing a bathrobe looks to her left with a serious expression.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=601&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=601&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698503/original/file-20251025-56-j6d4ki.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=601&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Eleanor Bumpurs in an undated photo.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/EleanorBumpurs/4d6c28bcf1e94c4286885af994bcd503/photo\">Associated Press</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The eviction</h2>\n\n<p>On the day of the shooting, officers from the New York City Police Department’s Emergency Service Unit and the city housing agency gathered with a city marshal, public housing and welfare workers and medical technicians outside Bumpurs’ apartment. They were there to evict Bumpurs, who was four months behind on her rent and owed the city a little over US$400, equivalent to about $1,240 in today’s dollars. Housing Authority policy required police to accompany city marshals to all evictions. </p>\n\n<p>As I recount in my book, this group believed Bumpurs was violent. Housing officers told the police that she was mentally ill and had a history of throwing lye on strangers. </p>\n\n<p>While Bumpurs had a history of mental illness, she was also an elderly woman in need of medical care. As The New York Times editorial board later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/22/opinion/lessons-of-the-bumpurs-case.html\">pointed out</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“… neither the city’s Housing Authority nor Human Resources Administration seemed able to help. Officials were unable to secure an emergency rent grant, for which she would have easily qualified. A consulting psychiatrist found her unable to function and recommended hospitalization, but no one moved fast enough.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The officers were tasked with subduing Bumpurs. They had little information about her underlying condition or training to manage it.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with gas masks, plastic shields, a restraining bar and a shotgun, six officers entered Bumpurs’ apartment. Police observed Bumpurs <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/21/nyregion/ex-officer-describes-key-moment-at-scene-of-the-bumpurs-shooting.html\">wielding a butcher knife</a> in her right hand. Officer Stephen Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/27/nyregion/autopsy-finds-bumpurs-was-hit-by-two-blasts.html\">fired two blasts</a> with the shotgun. The first severely damaged Bumpurs’ right hand; the second struck her in the chest. Bumpurs died at a local hospital.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/36l5-4k6H-A?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Paton Blough, who has bipolar disorder that triggers delusions, explains what it’s like to be arrested during a mental illness episode.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Public outrage</h2>\n\n<p>Bumpurs’ killing shocked New Yorkers. City leaders and community activists condemned what they saw as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/nyregion/rites-for-woman-police-killed.html\">NYPD’s use of excessive force against Black</a> people and other people of color, particularly those with mental health conditions.</p>\n\n<p>As then-city clerk and future mayor David Dinkins put it, “<a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2001/11/07/worst-possible-consequences-eleanor-bumpurs-october-november-1984-chapter-462/\">It is inconceivable to me that deadly force was employed here</a>.” The New York Times called Bumpurs’ death “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/22/opinion/lessons-of-the-bumpurs-case.html\">a grave error of police procedure and judgment</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Bumpurs’ killing was discussed in Sunday morning sermons, university lecture halls, beauty salons and barbershops. Many New Yorkers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/nyregion/rites-for-woman-police-killed.html?searchResultPosition=6\">denounced the shooting</a>, although others <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/13/nyregion/officers-union-runs-ads-backing-action-of-police-in-bumpurs-case.html?searchResultPosition=15\">praised Sullivan</a> for protecting the lives of his fellow officers.</p>\n\n<p>Artists took up Bumpurs’ cause. In her 1986 poem “For the Record: In Memory of Eleanor Bumpers,” Audre Lorde wrote: </p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code> Who will count the big fleshy women\n the grandmother weighing 22 stone\n with the rusty braids\n and gap-toothed scowl\n who wasn’t afraid of Armageddon\n . . . . \n and I am going to keep writing it down\n how they carried her body out of the house\n dress torn up around her waist\n uncovered\n past tenants and the neighborhood children\n a mountain of Black Woman\n and I am going to keep telling this\n if it kills me\n and it might in ways I am\n learning\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In 1989, Brooklyn filmmaker Spike Lee dedicated his movie “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097216/\">Do the Right Thing</a>” to Bumpurs and other Black New Yorkers killed by police officers.</p>\n\n<p>Critics argued that Sullivan should be terminated and charged with homicide. They called for holding city workers responsible for mishandling the eviction and pressed Mayor Edward Koch and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/30/nyregion/fbi-investigating-killing-by-police-in-eviction.html\">U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani</a> to investigate it.</p>\n\n<p>Through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/16/nyregion/independent-inquity-is-sought-in-eviction-death.html?searchResultPosition=1\">rallies</a>, grassroots lobbying and letter-writing campaigns, activists demanded legal justice for Bumpurs. They also called for reforms, including <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/01/25/nycha-apartment-repairs-nypd-victim-eleanor-bumpurs/\">new police policies</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Amid activists’ calls for his arrest, Sullivan said he had been justified in shooting Bumpurs. He insisted that he had <a href=\"https://www.police1.com/legal/articles/ex-officer-accused-in-84-shooting-sympathizes-with-sean-bell-cops-TojkX9VME4UhKFYO/\">followed police procedures</a>.     </p>\n\n<h2>City action</h2>\n\n<p>In response to Bumpurs’ death, the NYPD implemented new procedures. Public pressure from activists inspired policy changes. </p>\n\n<p>Officers were instructed not to confront “an emotionally disturbed person believed to be armed or violent. No action will be taken until the Precinct Commander or Duty Captain arrives and <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/121490NCJRS.pdf\">evaluates the situation</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>The new policies prioritized <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/27/nyregion/autopsy-finds-bumpurs-was-hit-by-two-blasts.html\">nonlethal methods</a> for responding to these emergencies, instructing officers to use nets, Tasers and restraining bars and shields rather than guns. </p>\n\n<p>Bumpurs’ family <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/weekinreview/the-region-police-protest-indictment-in-bronx-shooting.html\">filed a $10 million lawsuit</a> against the city, which ultimately led to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/nyregion/new-york-city-to-pay-heirs-in-bumpurs-case.html\">a $200,000 settlement</a> in 1990. In 1985, Sullivan was indicted by a Bronx grand jury on a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/weekinreview/the-region-judge-dismisses-indictment-in-bumpurs-case.html\">manslaughter charge</a>, which carried a maximum of 15 years in prison. He was convicted but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/27/nyregion/judge-acquits-sullivan-in-shotgun-slaying-of-bumpurs.html\">acquitted on appeal in 1987</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/27/nyregion/full-duty-to-be-restored.html\">restored to full duty</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Little lasting change</h2>\n\n<p>Even as the NYPD has adopted various training programs, people with mental illnesses continue to face <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2019/03/21/the-nypd-s-mental-illness-response-breakdown/\">excessive and deadly force</a> when they confront the police. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Protesters hold signs reading 'Eleanor Bumpurs,' 'No Justice No Peace,' and 'Ferguson is Everywhere Justice for Michael Brown and Eric Garner'.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698509/original/file-20251026-56-y33q0m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Protesters in New York City demonstrate over police violence against Black people, including Eric Garner and Michael Brown, who were both killed by police in 2014.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/protesters-take-to-the-streets-of-new-york-and-nationwide-news-photo/587552792\">Viviane Moos/Corbis via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Most recently, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2017/2017-01-19-OIGNYPDCIT-Report.pdf\">Crisis Intervention Team in 2015</a> and the Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division <a href=\"https://mentalhealth.cityofnewyork.us/b-heard\">program in 2021</a>. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2017/2017-01-19-OIGNYPDCIT-Report.pdf\">approximately 4,700 NYPD officers</a> out of a force of <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/RevenueSpending/nypd.html\">slightly over 35,000</a> completed Crisis Intervention Team training, which provided instruction for responding to mental health emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, New Yorkers continued to confront police violence. On Oct. 18, 2016, police Sgt. Hugh Barry responded to reports that 66-year-old Deborah Danner, who was schizophrenic, had been screaming in the halls of her Bronx apartment building. Barry, who had not received CIT training, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/nyregion/nypd-officer-trial-danner.html\">fatally shot Danner</a> when she allegedly swung a bat at him. Barry was later indicted and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/02/15/cop-found-not-guilty-in-fatal-shooting-of-mentally-ill-woman/\">acquitted of murder</a> in 2018. </p>\n\n<p>The B-Heard program dispatches mental health professionals and fire department paramedics to 911 mental health calls. As of 2024, however, it covered only <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nycs-b-heard-mental-health-response-teams/\">31 out of 77 NYPD precincts</a>. Police officers still respond to many mental health calls <a href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2024/05/22/nypd-mental-health-emergencies\">using Tasers or firearms</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On March 27, 2024, for example, 19-year-old Queens resident <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/09/12/ccrb-cites-excessive-force-win-rozario-killing/\">Win Rozario</a> called 911 because he was experiencing a mental health episode. Since no B-Heard unit served Rozario’s neighborhood, police were dispatched. Rozario <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/nyregion/win-rozario-shooting-nypd-excessive-force.html\">was fatally shot</a> minutes after officers entered his home. </p>\n\n<p>Other U.S. communities have had greater success using <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/23/police-emergency-mental-health-911\">civilian response teams</a>. Examples include Denver’s <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/evaluating-alternative-crisis-response-denvers-support-team-assisted-response\">Support Team Assistance Response program</a> and Seattle’s <a href=\"https://www.hca.wa.gov/assets/program/fact-sheet-lead.pdf\">Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion initiative</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LR7xx2bmBgI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">More than a dozen U.S. cities are increasingly responding to nonviolent mental health crises with clinicians and EMTs or paramedics instead of police.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Research shows that such initiatives are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-023-01299-1\">safer and more effective</a> than relying on law enforcement interventions.

As a result, Powell and his Fed colleagues might have considered the price of gas or changes in the cost of coffee to arrive at <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\">their decision to cut interest rates</a> a quarter point at their latest monetary policy meeting, which ended Oct. 29, 2025. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm\">The Federal Reserve’s mandate</a> is to implement monetary policy that stabilizes prices and promotes full employment, but there is a delicate balance to strike. Not only do Powell and the Fed have to weigh domestic inflation, jobs and spending, but they must also respond to changes in President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-us-eyes-china-export-curbs-as-trump-wobbles-on-meeting-with-chinas-xi-162418423.html\">global tariff policy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://mendoza.nd.edu/mendoza-directory/profile/jason-reed/#Biography\">economist and finance professor</a> at the University of Notre Dame, I know the Fed has a tough job of guiding the economy under even the most ideal circumstances. Now, imagine creating policy partially blindfolded, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-how-it-affects-key-economic-data-publishing-2025-10-06\">without access to key economic data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But, fortunately, the Fed’s not flying blind – it still has a wide range of private, internal and public data to help it read the pulse of the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<h2>Key data is MIA</h2>\n\n<p>The Fed is data-dependent, as Powell likes to <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/jerome-powell-nabe-speech-today-will-powell-lock-in-two-fed-rate-cuts-or-unleash-fresh-market-chaos-as-wall-street-the-dollar-and-bitcoin-hover-near-make-or-break-levels-the-turning-point-for-u-s-markets-is-here/articleshow/124554862.cms?from=mdr\">remind markets</a>. But the cancellation of reports <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">on employment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/jlt/\">job openings and turnover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html\">retail sales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product\">gross domestic product</a>, along with a delay in the September <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\">consumer price information</a>, will force the central bank to lean harder on private data to nail down the appropriate path for monetary policy. </p>\n\n<p>Torsten Slok, chief economist for the Apollo asset management firm, recently released his set of “<a href=\"https://www.apolloacademy.com/alternative-data-during-the-shutdown\">alternative data</a>,” capturing information from a wide range of sources. This includes <a href=\"https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-pmi-reports/\">ISM PMI reports</a>, which measure economic activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, and <a href=\"https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/\">Bloomberg’s robust data on consumer spending habits</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Generally, the private data, the alternative data that we look at is better used as a supplement for the underlying governmental data, which is the gold standard,” <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/14/powell-no-risk-free-path-october-fed-meeting/86692354007/\">Powell said in mid-October</a>. “It won’t be as effective as the main course as it would have been as a supplement.” </p>\n\n<p>But at this crucial juncture, the Fed has also abruptly lost one important source of private data.

This suggests the Fed will likely see an uptick in the unemployment rate, once the data resumes publishing.</p>\n\n<p>And if you did notice an increase in the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/brewing-crisis-java-loving-ny-012906025.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAq2cWjtHwhZXwix214_ilBhNeB3zEODHTIVsIBL0R76INXsGMNsejepu6szuKqgNE4sMOsFEFqJu05-seTD5n9TLS7E6J950mETWaUN4HEWOCbY91j4T9q8C08guo3rYdXw6kwPA05nxPdOek0_-yVyFwcLeWt61NYktcvzoKJD\">price of your morning coffee</a>, you’re not mistaken – both private and market-based data suggest inflation is a pressing concern, with expectations that price increases will remain at about the 2% target set by the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>It’s clear that there is no risk-free path for policy, and a wrong move by the Fed could stoke inflation or even send the U.S. economy spiraling into a recession.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"piUwe\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/piUwe/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Uncertain path ahead</h2>\n\n<p>At the Fed’s September monetary policy meeting, members <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">voted to cut benchmark interest rates</a> by 25 basis points, while one member advocated for a 50-point cut. </p>\n\n<p>It was the first interest rate cut since December – one that Trump had been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/21/powell-trump-fed-inflation-jackson-hole-00517488\">loudly demanding</a> to help spur the U.S. economy and lower the cost of government debt. Following the Oct. 29 interest rate cut, <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">markets expect the FOMC</a> to reduce rates by another quarter of a percentage point in December. That would lower rates to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, from 3.75%-4% currently, which would give the labor market a much-needed boost.</p>\n\n<p>But there’s lots of uncertainty about where rates are headed from here. On Oct. 29, Powell said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/29/business/federal-reserve-interest-rates\">there is no guarantee</a> the Fed will cut rates in December – and the future beyond that is even less certain. He suggested the lack of government data due to the shutdown may be an argument in favor of holding rates steady.</p>\n\n<p>At quarterly meetings, members of the Federal Open Market Committee give projections of where they think the Fed’s benchmark interest rate will go over the next three years and beyond to provide forward guidance to financial markets and other observers.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250917.pdf\">median projection</a> from the September meeting suggests the benchmark rate will end 2026 a little lower than where it began, at 3.4%, and decline to 3.1% by the end of 2027. With <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/%5D(https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\">inflation accelerating</a>, Fed officials will continue to weigh the weakening labor market against the threat of inflation from tariffs, immigration reform and their own lower interest rates – not to mention the ongoing impact of the government shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I believe these risks will be difficult to mitigate with just Fed intervention, even with perfect foresight into the economy, and will need help from government immigration, tax and spending policy to put the economy on the right path. </p>\n\n<p><em>This article was updated on Oct. 29 with paraphrased quote from Jerome Powell.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267204/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jason Reed does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That includes investments in grid modernization, energy storage and efforts to protect communities from outages during extreme weather and cyberattacks. Ending these projects leaves Americans vulnerable to more frequent and longer-lasting power outages.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy has defended the cancellations, saying that “the projects <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/10/energy-department-announces-7-56b-in-award-terminations-00591383\">did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs</a>, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Yet before any funds are actually released through these programs, each grant must pass <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/management/articles/merit-review-guide-financial-assistance-and-unsolicited-proposals-current\">evaluations based on the department’s standards</a>. Those included rigorous assessments of technical merits, potential risks and cost-benefit analyses — all designed to ensure alignment with national energy priorities and responsible stewardship of public funds.</p>\n\n<p>I am an <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/003UH00000SItcDYAT/roshi-nateghi\">associate professor</a> studying sustainability, with over <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I5tDhsoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">15 years of experience in energy systems reliability and resilience</a>. In the past, I also served as a Department of Energy program manager focused on grid resilience. I know that many of these canceled grants were foundational investments in the science and infrastructure necessary to keep the lights on, especially when the grid is under stress. </p>\n\n<p>The dollar-value estimates vary, and some of the money has <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10102025/the-trump-administration-is-cutting-billions-in-clean-energy-grants-but-savings-are-overstated/\">already been spent</a>. A <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/factsheets-for-canceled-doe-projects/\">list of canceled projects</a> maintained by energy analysis company Yardsale totals about US$5 billion. An Oct. 2, 2025, announcement from the department <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-termination-223-projects-saving-over-75-billion\">touts $7.5 billion in cuts to 321 awards</a> across 223 projects. <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-floats-new-cuts-to-hundreds-of-clean-energy-grants\">Additional documents leaked to Politico</a> reportedly identified additional awards under review. Some media reports suggest the full value of at-risk commitments may reach <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/which-awards-does-doe-plan-to-cut-visualizing-the-funds-on-the-line\">$24 billion</a> — a figure that has not been publicly confirmed or refuted by the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p>These were not speculative ventures. And some of them were competitively awarded projects that the department funded specifically to enhance grid efficiency, reliability and resilience.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"WsNeF\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WsNeF/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Grid improvement funding</h2>\n\n<p>For years, the federal government has been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5428.690\">criticized for investing too little</a> in the nation’s electricity grid. The long-term planning — and spending — required to ensure the grid reliably serves the public often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102668\">falls victim to short-term political cycles</a> and shifting priorities across both parties.</p>\n\n<p>But these recent cuts come amid <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/\">increasingly frequent extreme weather</a>, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/powering-cyber-resilience-energy-sector/\">increased cybersecurity threats</a> to the systems that keep the lights on, and aging grid equipment that is <a href=\"https://sepapower.org/knowledge/the-aging-us-power-grid-navigating-toward-modernization/\">nearing the end of its life</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These projects sought to make the grid more reliable so it can withstand storms, hackers, accidents and other problems.</p>\n\n<h2>National laboratories</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to those project cancellations, President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for 2026 contains deep cuts to the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/federal-energy-office-illustrates-the-perils-of-fluctuating-budgets-and-priorities-255936\">Office of Energy

href=\"https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-resilience-and-innovation-partnerships-grip-program\">Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships Program</a>, also funded efforts to automate grid operations, allowing faster response to outages or changes in output from power plants. It also supported developing microgrids – localized systems that can operate independently during outages. The canceled projects in that program, <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/factsheets-for-canceled-doe-projects/\">estimated to total $724.6 million</a>, were in 24 states.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Otter_Tail_Power_Co_GRIP2_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">$19.5 million</a> project in the Upper Midwest would have installed smart sensors and software to detect overloaded power lines or equipment failures, helping people respond faster to outages and prevent blackouts.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Southern_California_Edison_GRIP2_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">$50 million</a> project in California would have boosted the capacity of existing subtransmission lines, improving power stability and grid flexibility by installing a smart substation, without needing new transmission corridors. </p>\n\n<p>Microgrid projects in <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DOE_GRIP_1038_Jamestown-Board-of-Public-Utilites_v4_RELEASE_508_0.pdf\">New York</a>, <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DOE_GRIP_1145_Kit-Carson-Electric-Cooperative_v4_RELEASE_508.pdf\">New Mexico</a> and <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ameresco_GRIP2_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">Hawaii</a> would have kept essential services running during disasters, cyberattacks and planned power outages.</p>\n\n<p>Another canceled project included <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Highland_Electric_Fleets_GRIP2_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">$11 million</a> to help utilities in 12 states use <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/electric-school-bus-v2g-lessons-examples\">electric school buses as backup batteries</a>, delivering power during emergencies and peak demand, like on hot summer days. </p>\n\n<p>Several transmission projects were also canceled, including a $464 million effort in the Midwest to <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JTIQ-Factsheet.pdf\">coordinate multiple grid connections from new generation sites</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Long-duration energy storage</h2>\n\n<p>The grid must meet demand at all times, even when wind and solar generation is low or when extreme weather downs power lines. A key element of that stability involves <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/long-duration-energy-storage-program\">storing massive amounts of electricity</a> for when it’s needed.</p>\n\n<p>One canceled project would have spent <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FactSheet_LDESAward_Xcel_6.5.24_v3.pdf\">$70 million turning retired coal plants</a> in Minnesota and Colorado into buildings holding iron-air batteries capable of powering <a href=\"https://knsiradio.com/2025/10/03/minnesota-loses-70-million-xcel-energy-battery-project-as-doe-cuts-funding\">several thousand homes for as many as four days</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two large yellow buses are parked next to each other.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697338/original/file-20251020-56-hfzobe.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Electric school buses like these could provide meaningful amounts of power to the grid during an outage.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/green-power-motor-companys-beast-ev-school-bus-outside-of-news-photo/1242550661\">Chris Jackson for The Washington Post via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Rural and remote energy systems</h2>\n\n<p>Another terminated program sought to help <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/oced/era\">people who live in rural or remote places</a>, who are often served by just one or two power lines rather than a grid that can reroute power around an interruption. </p>\n\n<p>A $30 million <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Factsheet_ERA_CommunityScaleRural_10.9.24.pdf\">small-scale bioenergy project</a> would have helped three rural California communities convert forest and agricultural waste into electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Not all of the terminated initiatives were explicitly designed for resilience. Some would have strengthened grid stability as a byproduct of their main goals. The rollback of <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/H2Hubs-ARCHES_Award-Fact-Sheet.pdf\">$1.2 billion in hydrogen hub investments</a>, for example, undermines projects that would have paired industrial decarbonization with large-scale energy storage to balance renewable power. Similarly, several canceled industrial modernization projects, such as <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Factsheet_IDP_GalloGlass_12.10.24.pdf\">hybrid electric furnaces</a> and <a href=\"https://yardsale.energy/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Factsheet_IDP_Brimstone.pdf\">low-carbon cement plants</a>, were structured to manage power demand and integrate clean energy, to improve grid stability and flexibility.</p>\n\n<h2>The reliability paradox</h2>\n\n<p>The administration has said that these <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-termination-223-projects-saving-over-75-billion\">cuts will save money</a>. In practice, however, they shift spending from prevention of extended outages to recovery from them.</p>\n\n<p>Without advances in technology and equipment, grid operators face more frequent outages, longer restoration times and rising maintenance costs. Without investment in systems that can withstand storms or hackers, taxpayers and ratepayers will ultimately bear the costs of repairing the damage.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the projects now on hold were intended to allow hospitals, schools and emergency centers to reduce blackout risks and speed power restoration. These are essential reliability and public safety functions, not partisan initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>Canceling programs to improve the grid leaves utilities and their customers dependent on emergency stopgaps — diesel generators, rolling blackouts and reactive maintenance — instead of forward-looking solutions.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267504/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Roshanak (Roshi) Nateghi does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Consuming spoiled foods exposes the body to a range of microbial toxins and biochemical by-products, many of which can interfere with essential biological processes. The health effects can vary from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to severe conditions such as liver cancer.</p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://www.engr.colostate.edu/cbe/people/brad-reisfeld/\">toxicologist and researcher</a> specializing in how foreign chemicals such as those released during food spoilage affect the body. Many spoiled foods contain specific microorganisms that produce toxins. Because individual sensitivity to these chemicals varies, and the amount present in spoiled foods can also vary widely, there are no absolute guidelines on what is safe to eat. However, it’s always a good idea to know your enemies so you can take steps to avoid them. </p>\n\n<h2>Nuts and grains</h2>\n\n<p>In plant-based foods such as grains and nuts, fungi are the main culprits behind spoilage, forming fuzzy patches of mold in shades of green, yellow, black or white that usually give off a musty smell. Colorful though they may be, many of these molds produce toxic chemicals called mycotoxins. </p>\n\n<p>Two common fungi found on grains and nuts such as <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/83271/download\">corn, sorghum, rice and peanuts</a> are <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> and <em>A. parasiticus</em>. They can produce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14050307\">mycotoxins known as aflatoxins</a>, which form molecules called epoxides that can trigger mutations when they bind to DNA. Repeated exposure to aflatoxins <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mycotoxins\">can damage the liver</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14252/foodsafetyfscj.2015026\">has been linked to liver cancer</a>, especially for people who already have other risk factors for it, such as hepatitis B infection.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Mold on corn cobs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698197/original/file-20251023-56-prvvjg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Fusarium molds can grow on corn and other grains.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/corn-cobs-are-affected-by-fusarium-the-causative-royalty-free-image/2182157647\">Orest Lyzhechka/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211741\">Fusarium</a> is another group of fungal pathogens that can grow as mold on grains such as wheat, barley and corn, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17340\">especially at high humidity</a>. Infected grains may appear discolored or have a pinkish or reddish hue, and they might emit a musty odor. Fusarium fungi produce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins16020090\">mycotoxins called trichothecenes</a>, which can damage cells and irritate the digestive tract. They also make <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115793\">another toxin, fumonisin B1</a>, which disrupts how cells build and maintain their outer membranes. Over time, these effects <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.06.007\">can harm the liver and kidneys</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If grains or nuts look moldy, discolored or shriveled, or if they have an unusual smell, it’s best to err on the side of caution and throw them out. Aflotoxins, especially, are known to be potent <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/25081-carcinogens\">cancer-causing agents</a>, so they have no safe level of exposure. </p>\n\n<h2>Fruits</h2>\n\n<p>Fruits can also harbor mycotoxins. When they become bruised or overripe, or are stored in damp conditions, mold can easily take hold and begin producing these harmful substances.</p>\n\n<p>One biggie is a blue mold called <em>Penicillium expansum,</em> which is best known for infecting apples but also attacks pears, cherries, peaches and other fruit. This fungus produces patulin, a toxin that interferes with key enzymes in cells to hobble normal cell functions and generate unstable molecules called reactive oxygen species that can harm DNA, proteins and fats. In large amounts, patulin <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins10110475\">can injure major organs</a> such as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins2040613\">kidneys, liver, digestive tract and immune system</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>P. expansum’s</em> blue and green cousins, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.833328\"><em>Penicillium italicum</em> and <em>Penicillium digitatum</em></a>, are frequent flyers on oranges, lemons and other citrus fruits.

However, molds can send out microscopic, rootlike structures called hyphae that penetrate deeply into food, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14100699\">potentially releasing toxins</a> even in seemingly unaffected bits. Especially for soft fruits, where hyphae can grow more easily, it’s safest to toss moldy specimens. Do it at your own risk, but for hard fruits I do sometimes just cut off the moldy bits.</p>\n\n<h2>Cheese</h2>\n\n<p>Cheese showcases the benefits of controlled microbial growth. In fact, mold is a crucial component in many of the cheeses you know and love. Blue cheeses such as Roquefort and Stilton get their distinctive, tangy flavor from chemicals produced by a fungus called <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em>. And the soft, white rind on cheeses such as Brie or Camembert contributes to their flavor and texture.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, unwanted molds look fuzzy or powdery and may take on unusual colors. Greenish-black or reddish molds, sometimes caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> species, can be toxic and should be discarded. Also, species such as <em>Penicillium commune</em> produce cyclopiazonic acid, a mycotoxin that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-6915%2885%2990284-4\">disrupts calcium flow across cell membranes</a>, potentially impairing muscle and nerve function. At high enough levels, it may cause tremors or other nervous system symptoms.

So cutting away at least one inch around the moldy spot is more of a safe bet – just take care not to touch the mold with your knife.</p>\n\n<h2>Meat</h2>\n\n<p>While molds are the primary concern for plant and dairy spoilage, bacteria are the main agents of meat decomposition. Telltale signs of meat spoilage include a slimy texture, discoloration that’s often greenish or brownish and a sour or putrid odor. </p>\n\n<p>Some harmful bacteria do not produce noticeable changes in smell, appearance or texture, making it difficult to assess the safety of meat based on sensory cues alone. That stink, though, is caused by chemicals such as cadaverine and putrescine that are formed as meat decomposes, and they can cause <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24501\">nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps,</a> as well as headaches, flushing or drops in blood pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Spoiled meats are rife with bacterial dangers. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20134227/\"><em>Escherichia coli</em>, a common contaminant of beef</a>, produces shiga toxin, which  chokes off <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7236-3\">some cells’ ability to make proteins</a> and can cause a dangerous kidney disease called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15010010\">hemolytic uremic syndrome</a>. Poultry often carries <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html\">the bacterium <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em></a>, which produces a toxin that invades gastrointestinal cells, often leading to diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. It can also provoke the body’s immune system to attack its own nerves, potentially sparking a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232214222\">rare condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome</a>, which can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/852195\">lead to temporary paralysis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Salmonella, found in eggs and undercooked chicken, is one of the most common types of food poisoning, causing diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramps. It releases toxins into the lining of the small and large intestines that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8435/\">drive extensive inflammation</a>. <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> also attacks the gut, but <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2024.2341968\">its toxins work by damaging cell membranes</a>. And <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>, which can lurk in improperly stored or canned meats, produces botulinum toxin, one of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism/\">most potent biological poisons</a> – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11120686\">lethal even in tiny amounts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is impossible for meat to be totally free of bacteria, but the longer it sits in your refrigerator – or worse, on your counter or in your grocery bag – the more those bacteria multiply. And you can’t cook the yuck away. Most bacteria die at meat-safe temperatures – between 145 and 165 degrees Fahrenheit (63-74 C) – but many bacterial toxins are heat stable and survive cooking.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263908/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Brad Reisfeld does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

After archaeologists uncovered his fossilized bones in 1960, they used them to <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/homo-habilis-early-maker-stone-tools.html\">define <em>Homo habilis</em></a> – the earliest known member of our own genus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paleoanthropologists define the first examples of the genus <em>Homo</em> based largely on their bigger brains – and, sometimes, smaller teeth – compared with other, earlier ancestors such as the australopithecines – the most famous of these being <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/lucy-discovered-50-years-ago-in-ethiopia-stood-just-3-5-feet-tall-but-she-still-towers-over-our-understanding-of-human-origins-227866\">Lucy</a>. There were at least three types of early humans: <em>Homo habilis</em>, <em>Homo rudolfensis</em> and the best documented species, <em>Homo erectus</em>. At least one of them created sites now in the archaeological record, where they brought and shared food, and made and used some of the earliest stone tools.</p>\n\n<p>These archaeological sites date to between 2.6 to 1.8 million years ago. The artifacts within them suggest greater cognitive complexity in early <em>Homo</em> than documented among any nonhuman primate. For example, at Nyayanga, a site in Kenya, anthropologists recently found that early humans were using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu5838\">tools they transported over distances</a> of up to 8 miles (13 kilometers). This action indicates forethought and planning.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, paleoanthropologists believed that <em>Homo habilis</em>, as the earliest big-brained humans, was responsible for the earliest sites with tools. The idea has been that <em>Homo habilis</em> was the ancestor of later and even bigger-brained <em>Homo erectus</em>, whose descendants eventually led to us.</p>\n\n<p>This narrative made sense when the oldest known <em>Homo erectus</em> remains were younger than 1.6 million years old. But given recent discoveries, this seems like a shaky foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, my team discovered a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8987\">1.85 million-year-old hand bone</a> at Olduvai Gorge, the same place the original <em>Homo habilis</em> had been found. But unlike the hand of that <em>Homo habilis</em> juvenile, this fossil looked like it belonged to a larger, more modern, fully land-based rather than tree-based human species: <em>Homo erectus</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, new finds have continued to push back the earliest dates for <em>Homo erectus</em>: about 2 million years ago in South Africa, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22208-x\">Kenya</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add9115\">Ethiopia</a>. Taken together, these discoveries reveal that <em>H. erectus</em> is slightly older than the known <em>H. habilis</em> fossils. We cannot simply assume that <em>H. habilis</em> gave rise to <em>H. erectus</em>. Instead, the human family tree <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw7293\">looks far bushier than we once thought</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What do all these finds suggest? Only one <em>Homo</em> species is our likely ancestor, and probably only one can be responsible for the complex behaviors revealed at the Olduvai Gorge sites. My colleagues and I hit on a way to test whether <em>Homo habilis</em> was top dog at Olduvai Gorge, so to speak, based on whether they were the hunters or the hunted.</p>\n\n<h2>Who was hunting who?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-6152-3\">At Olduvai Gorge</a>, there is overwhelming evidence that early <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/C2023-0-51163-2\">humans were consuming animals</a> as big as a gazelle or even a zebra. <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/rough-and-tumble/hardcover\">Not only</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/C2023-0-51163-2\">did they hunt</a>, but they repeatedly brought these animals back to the same location for communal consumption. This is the concept of a “central provisioning place,” much like a campsite or home today. Dating to 1.85 million years ago, this is the oldest evidence of frequent meat-eating – and of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0067270X.2016.1252066\">early humans regularly acting as predators</a> rather than prey. </p>\n\n<p>All animals occupy a position on a food web, from top to lower ranks. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2569\">Top-ranking predators</a>, such as lions, are usually not preyed upon by lower ranking carnivores, such as hyenas.</p>\n\n<p>If <em>Homo habilis</em> was acquiring large animal carcasses, either by hunting or by chasing lions away from their own kills, it seems logical that these hominids could effectively cope with predation risks. That is, a hunter usually isn’t hunted.</p>\n\n<p>In African savannas, apex predators like lions <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.2379\">do not usually die from other predator attacks</a>. Humans today also occupy a top predatory niche: For example, <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-hadza/hardcover\">Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania</a> not only hunt game, but also fend off lions from their kills, and successfully defend themselves from attacks by other predators, such as leopards.</p>\n\n<p>But, if <em>Homo habilis</em> was not yet a top predator, then you would expect them to have occasionally been prey to lower-on-the-food-chain carnivorous cats – such as leopards – who often hunt primates.</p>\n\n<p>Most known human fossils at this stage of evolution do bear traces of carnivore damage, including the two best preserved <em>H. habilis</em> fossils from Olduvai Gorge. Was it caused after death, by a scavenging carnivore? Or did a big cat at the top of the food chain kill these early humans?</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I set out to address the question of which predators were getting their teeth on <em>H. habilis</em> and presumably whether before or after the ancient humans died.</p>\n\n<h2>AI suggests <em>H. habilis</em> wasn’t an apex predator</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s where artificial intelligence comes in. Using <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-vision\">computer vision</a>, we trained AI on hundreds of microscopic images showing tooth marks left by the main carnivores in Africa today: lions, leopards, hyenas and crocodiles. The AI learned to recognize the subtle differences between the marks made by the different predators and was able to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.250548\">classify the marks with high accuracy</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"four different magnified craters on brownish backgrounds\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698741/original/file-20251027-66-epphd8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=565&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Tooth marks left by the four types of carnivores recorded.

The size and shape of the marks on the fossils from those two early <em>Homo habilis</em> individuals line up with what leopards leave today when feeding on prey.</p>\n\n<p>Our discovery challenges the long-standing view of <em>Homo habilis</em> as the first skilled toolmaker, hunter and meat-eater.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe it shouldn’t be too surprising. The only complete skeleton of this species found at Olduvai Gorge belonged to a very small individual – just about 3 feet tall (less than 1 meter) – with a body that still showed features suited for climbing trees. That hardly matches the image of a hunter able to bring down large animals or steal carcasses from lions.</p>\n\n<p>If it wasn’t <em>Homo habilis</em> performing these feats, maybe it was <em>Homo erectus</em>, a species with a larger body and more modern anatomy. But that opens up other mysteries for future researchers: What was <em>Homo habilis</em> doing at the archaeological sites of Olduvai Gorge if it was not responsible for the tools and signs of hunting we find there? Where exactly did <em>Homo erectus</em> come from, and how did it evolve?</p>\n\n<p>My team and others will be returning to places like Olduvai Gorge to ask these questions in the years to come.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266561/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo receives funding from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Universities</span></em></p>",

After publishing a short book showing that the so-called Glozel alphabet was a mishmash of previously known early alphabetic writing, in October 1927 Dussaud took out a subscription to a clipping service to track mentions of the Glozel affair; in four months he received over 1,500 clippings, in 10 languages.</p>\n\n<p>The Dussaud clippings became the basis for the account of Glozel in my recent book, “<a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo243422733.html\">Sensations</a>.” That the contours of the affair first became clear to me in a pile of yellowed newspaper

Early on, the commissioners noted that they were “experienced diggers, all with past fieldwork to their credit,” in different chronological subfields of archaeology. In contrast, they noted that the Glozel site showed clear signs of a lack of order and method.</p>\n\n<p>In their initial meeting in Vichy, the assembled archaeologists agreed that they would give no interviews during their visit to Glozel and would not speak to the press afterward. But, aware of “certain tendentious articles published by a few newspapers,” the visitors <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k505321c/f4.item\">issued a communiqué</a> stating that they would neither confirm nor deny any press reports. Their scholarly publication would be their final word on the “non-ancientness” of the site.</p>\n\n<p>The distinction between true science – what the archaeologists were practicing – and the media seemed absolute.      </p>\n\n<h2>Sensationalist coverage, but careful details, too</h2>\n\n<p>And yet matters were not so simple.</p>\n\n<p>Many newspapers devoted extensive and careful coverage to Glozel. They offered explanations of archaeological terminology. They explained the larger stakes of the controversy, which, beyond the invention of the alphabet, involved nothing less than the direction of the development of Western civilization itself, whether from Mesopotamia in the east to Europe in the west or the reverse.</p>\n\n<p>Even articles about seemingly trivial matters, such as the work clothes the archaeologists donned to perform their test excavations at Glozel, served to reinforce the larger point the commissioners made in their report. In contrast to the proper suits and ties they wore for formal photographs marking their arrival, the visitors all put on blue overalls, which for one newspaper “gave them the air of <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bd6t53801665/f18.item\">apprentice locksmiths or freshly decked-out electricians</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>The risk, apparent in this jocular reference, of losing the social standing afforded them by their professional degrees and education was worth taking because it drove home these archaeologists’ devotion to their discipline, which their report described as “a daily moral obligation.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"seven people dressed formally standing against a building\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698425/original/file-20251024-56-td4ej1.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Morlet, far left, and the international commission in front of the Fradins’ museum in November 1927.

A group of archaeologists responded on her behalf, explaining what she had actually been doing and <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8127857/f1.item\">defending her professionalism</a> – in the press.</p>\n\n<p>At the most basic level, media coverage recorded the standard operating procedures of archaeology and its openness to outside scrutiny.

Because the plasma is conductive, magnetic fields loop out of the solar surface. Since different parts of the surface rotate at different speeds, the fields get tangled. Eventually, like rubber bands pulled too tight, they can snap – and that is what they did last year.  </p>\n\n<p>These titanic plasma explosions, also known as <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/solar-flares-radio-blackouts\">solar flares</a>, each unleashed the energy of a million hydrogen bombs. Parts of the Sun’s magnetic field also broke free as magnetic bubbles loaded with billions of tons of plasma. </p>\n\n<p>These bubbles, called <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\">coronal mass ejections</a>, or CMEs, crashed through space at around 6,000 times the speed of a commercial jetliner. After a few days, they smashed one after another into the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/earths-magnetic-field-protects-life-on-earth-from-radiation-but-it-can-move-and-the-magnetic-poles-can-even-flip-216231\">magnetic field that envelops Earth</a>. The plasma in each CME surged toward us, <a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/science/aurorae-throughout-our-solar-system-and-beyond/\">creating brilliant auroras</a> and powerful electrical currents that rippled through Earth’s crust. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6C1_Qci8nQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A coronal mass ejection erupting from the Sun.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>You might not have noticed. Just like the opposite poles of fridge magnets have to align for them to snap together, the poles of the magnetic field of Earth and the incoming CMEs have to line up just right for the plasma in the CMEs to reach Earth. This time they didn’t, so most of the plasma sailed off into deep space. </p>\n\n<p>Humans have not always been so lucky. I’m an <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nfu-9HAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">environmental historian</a> and author of the new book “<a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674986503\">Ripples on the Cosmic Ocean: An Environmental History of Our Place in the Solar System</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>While writing the book, I learned that a series of technological breakthroughs – from telegraphs to satellites – have left modern societies <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/solar-storm-knocks-out-farmers-high-tech-tractors-an-electrical-engineer-explains-how-a-larger-storm-could-take-down-the-power-grid-and-the-internet-177982\">increasingly vulnerable</a> to the influence of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/solar-storms-can-destroy-satellites-with-ease-a-space-weather-expert-explains-the-science-177510\">solar storms</a>, meaning flares and CMEs. </p>\n\n<p>Since the 19th century, these storms have repeatedly upended life on Earth. Today, there are hints that they threaten the very survival of civilization as we know it. </p>\n\n<h2>The telegraph: A first warning</h2>\n\n<p>On the morning of Sept. 1, 1859, two young astronomers, <a href=\"https://www2.hao.ucar.edu/education/scientists/richard-christopher-carrington-1826-1875\">Richard Carrington</a> and Richard Hodgson, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-clock-in-the-sun/9780231202480/\">became the first humans to see</a> a solar flare. To their astonishment, it was so powerful that, for two minutes, it far outshone the rest of the Sun. </p>\n\n<p>About 18 hours later, brilliant, blood-red auroras flickered across the night sky as far south as the equator, while newly built telegraph lines shorted out across Europe and the Americas. </p>\n\n<p>The Carrington Event, as it was later called, revealed that the <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691141268/the-sun-kings\">Sun’s environment could violently change</a>. It also suggested that emerging technologies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/telegraph\">electrical telegraph</a>, were beginning to link modern life to the extraordinary violence of the Sun’s most explosive changes. </p>\n\n<p>For more than a century, these connections amounted to little more than inconveniences, like occasional telegraph outages, partly because no solar storm rivaled the power of <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/a-perfect-solar-superstorm-the-1859-carrington-event\">the Carrington Event</a>. But another part of the reason was that the world’s economies and militaries were only gradually coming to rely more and more on technologies that turned out to be profoundly vulnerable to the Sun’s changes.  </p>\n\n<h2>A brush with Armageddon</h2>\n\n<p>Then came May 1967. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/11/archives/a-us-destroyer-in-far-east-bumped-by-soviet-warship-soviet.html\">Soviet and American warships collided</a> in the Sea of Japan, American troops <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/America_s_Last_Vietnam_Battle.html?id=vdygEAAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description\">crossed into</a> North Vietnam and the Middle East teetered on the brink of the <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/six-days-of-war-9780195151749?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Six-Day War</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It was only a frightening combination of new technologies that kept the United States and Soviet Union from all-out war; <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/military-history-and-science/rockets-missiles-and-nuclear-weapons\">nuclear missiles</a> could now destroy a country within minutes, but radar could detect their approach in time for retaliation.

Yet the magnitude of that risk only came into focus in <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674986503\">March 1989</a>, when 11 powerful flares preceded the arrival of back-to-back coronal mass ejections. </p>\n\n<p>For more than two decades, North American utility companies had constructed a sprawling transmission system that relayed electricity from power plants to consumers.

Rather than flow through the rock, currents instead surged into the world’s biggest hydroelectric transmission system. It collapsed, leaving millions without power in subzero weather. </p>\n\n<p>Repairs revealed something disturbing: The currents had damaged multiple transformers, which are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/transformer-electronics\">enormous customized devices</a> that transfer electricity between circuits. </p>\n\n<p>Transformers <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/12507/severe-space-weather-events-understanding-societal-and-economic-impacts-a\">can take many months to replace</a>. Had the 1989 storm been as powerful as the Carrington Event, hundreds of transformers might have been destroyed. It could have taken years to restore electricity across North America.  </p>\n\n<h2>Solar storms: An existential risk</h2>\n\n<p>But was the Carrington Event really the worst storm that the Sun can unleash?</p>\n\n<p>Scientists assumed that it was until, in 2012, a team of Japanese scientists <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11123\">found evidence of an extraordinary burst</a> of high-energy particles in the growth rings of trees dated to the eighth century CE. The leading explanation for them: huge solar storms dwarfing the Carrington Event. Scientists now estimate that these “<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oldest-and-largest-solar-storm-on-record-found-locked-in-tree-rings-in-an-ancient-french-forest/\">Miyake Events</a>” happen once every few centuries. </p>\n\n<p>Astronomers have also discovered that, every century, Sun-like stars can <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl5441\">explode in super flares</a> up to 10,000 times more powerful than the strongest solar flares ever observed. Because the Sun is older and rotates more slowly than many of these stars, its super flares may be <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abc8f5\">much rarer</a>, occurring perhaps once every 3,000 years.  </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the implications are alarming. Powerful solar storms <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/weird-space-weather-seems-to-have-influenced-human-behavior-on-earth-41-000-years-ago-our-unusual-scientific-collaboration-explores-how-257216\">once influenced humanity</a> only by creating brilliant auroras. Today, civilization depends on electrical networks that allow commodities, information and people to move across our world, from sewer systems to <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59175\">satellite constellations</a>. </p>\n\n<p>What would happen if these systems suddenly collapsed on a continental scale for months, even years? Would millions die? And could a single solar storm bring that about? </p>\n\n<p>Researchers are working on answering these questions. For now, one thing is certain: to protect these networks, scientists must <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_weather/Monitoring_space_weather\">monitor the Sun</a> in real time. That way, operators can reduce or reroute the electricity flowing through grids when a CME approaches. A little preparation may prevent a collapse. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, satellites and telescopes on Earth today keep the Sun under constant observation. Yet in the United States, recent efforts to <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts\">reduce NASA’s science budget</a> have cast doubt on plans to replace aging Sun-monitoring satellites. Even the <a href=\"https://nso.edu/telescopes/inouye-solar-telescope/\">Daniel K.

A decade after <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/history/watson-jeopardy\">IBM’s Watson</a> triumphed on “Jeopardy!,” generative AI models are in kitchens and home offices. People often talk about AI in science fiction terms, yet the most consequential change in 2025 may be its banal ubiquity. </p>\n\n<p>To appreciate how ordinary AI use has become, it helps to remember that this trend didn’t start with generative chatbots. A 2017 Knowledge at Wharton newsletter <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/artificial-intelligence-powering-everyday-tasks/\">documented how deep learning algorithms</a> were already powering chatbots on social media and photo apps’ facial recognition functions. Digital assistants such as Siri and Alexa were performing everyday tasks, and AI-powered image generators could create images that <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/artificial-intelligence-powering-everyday-tasks/\">fooled 40% of viewers</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When ChatGPT became publicly available on Nov. 30, 2022, the shift felt sudden, but it was built on years of incremental integration. AI’s presence is now so mundane that people consult chatbots for recipes, use them as study partners and rely on them for administrative chores. As a <a href=\"https://facultyweb.kennesaw.edu/jlaw29/index.php\">writer and professor</a> who <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=LKxRdH0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">studies ways that generative AI</a> can be an everyday collaborator, I find that recent usage reports show how AI has been woven into everyday life. (Full disclosure: I am a member of OpenAI’s Educator Council, an uncompensated group of higher education faculty who provide feedback to OpenAI on educational use cases.)</p>\n\n<h2>Who’s using ChatGPT and why?</h2>\n\n<p>Economists at <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255\">OpenAI and Harvard</a> analyzed 1.5 million ChatGPT conversations from November 2022 through July 2025. Their findings show that <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/\">adoption has broadened</a> beyond early users: It’s being used all over the world, among all types of people. Adoption has grown fastest in low- and middle-income countries, and growth rates in the lowest-income countries are now more than four times those in the richest nations. </p>\n\n<p>Most interactions revolve around mundane activities. Three-quarters of conversations involve practical guidance, information seeking and writing. These categories are for activities such as getting advice on how to cook an unusual type of food, where to find the nearest pharmacy, and getting feedback on email drafts. More than 70% of ChatGPT use is for nonwork tasks, demonstrating AI’s role in people’s personal lives. The economists found that 73% of messages were not related to work as of June 2025, up from 53% in June 2024.</p>\n\n<h2>Claude and the geography of adoption</h2>\n\n<p>Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report\">economic index</a> paints a similar picture of uneven AI adoption. Researchers at the company tracked users’ conversations with the company’s Claude AI chatbot relative to working-age population. The data shows sharp contrasts between nations. Singapore’s per-capita use is 4.6 times higher than expected based on its population size, and Canada’s is 2.9 times higher. India and Nigeria, meanwhile, use Claude at only a quarter of predicted levels. </p>\n\n<p>In the United States, use reflects local economies, with activity tied to regional strengths: tech in California, finance in Florida and documentation in D.C. In lower-use countries, more than half of Claude’s activity involves programming. In higher-use countries, people apply it across education, science and business. High-use countries favor humans working iteratively with AI, such as refining text, while low-use countries rely more on delegating full tasks, such as finding information.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that OpenAI reports between <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/seven-things-we-learned-from-openais-first-study-on-chatgpt-usage/\">400 million and 700 million</a> weekly active users in 2025, while third-party analytics estimate Claude at <a href=\"https://sqmagazine.co.uk/claude-ai-statistics/#:%7E:text=Editor's%20Choice,adoption%20among%20mid%2Dcareer%20adults\">roughly 30 million monthly active users</a> during a similar time period. For comparison, Gemini had approximately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/#:%7E:text=Google%20Gemini%20has%20350M%20monthly%20users%2C%20reveals%20court%20hearing%20%7C%20TechCrunch\">350 million monthly active users</a> and Microsoft reported in July 2025 <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q4?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">more than 100 million monthly active users for its Copilot apps</a>. Perplexity’s CEO reported in an interview that the company’s language AI has a “<a href=\"https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/deans-speaker-series-perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-phd-21-on-why-he-ditched-pitch-decks/#:%7E:text=I'm%20speaking%20to%20an,just%20such%20a%20great%20product\">user base of over 30 million active users</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>While these metrics are from a similar time period, mid-2025, it’s important to note the differences in reporting and metrics, particularly weekly versus monthly active users. By any measure, though, ChatGPT’s user base is by far the largest, making it a commonly used generative AI tool for everyday tasks.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"qWgXR\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qWgXR/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Everyday tool</h2>\n\n<p>So, what do mundane uses of AI look like at home? Consider these scenarios:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Meal planning and recipes: A parent asks ChatGPT for vegan meal ideas that use leftover kale and mushrooms, saving time and reducing waste. </li>\n<li>Personal finance: ChatGPT drafts a budget, suggests savings strategies or explains the fine print of a credit card offer, translating legalese into plain language.</li>\n<li>Writing support: Neurodivergent writers use ChatGPT to organize ideas and scaffold drafts. A writer with ADHD can upload notes and ask the model to group them into themes, then expand each into a paragraph while keeping the writer’s tone and reasoning. This helps reduce cognitive overload and supports focus, while the writer retains their own voice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These scenarios illustrate that AI can help with mundane decisions, act as a sounding board and support creativity. The help with mundane tasks can be a big lift: By handling routine planning and information retrieval, AI frees people to focus on empathy, judgment and reflection. </p>\n\n<h2>From extraordinary to ordinary tool</h2>\n\n<p>AI has transitioned from a futuristic curiosity to an everyday co-pilot, with voice assistants and generative models helping people write, cook and plan.</p>\n\n<p>Inviting AI to our kitchen tables not as a mysterious oracle but as a helpful assistant means <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-isnt-replacing-student-writing-but-it-is-reshaping-it-254878\">cultivating AI literacy</a> and learning prompting techniques. It means recognizing AI’s strengths, mitigating its risks and shaping a future where intelligence — human and artificial — works for everyone.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266670/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jeanne Beatrix Law serves on the OpenAI Educator Council, an uncompensated group of higher education faculty who provide feedback to OpenAI on educational use cases and occasionally tests models for those use cases.</span></em></p>",

It’s as if the museum has taken a long, deep breath … and decided to loosen its collar. </p>\n\n<h2>Insta-friendly design</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, the museum’s granite facade has represented permanence. Its <a href=\"https://www.architecture.org/online-resources/architecture-encyclopedia/pediment\">pediments</a> crowned with <a href=\"https://www.theoi.com/Thaumasios/Grypes.html\">griffins</a> – mythological creatures that are part lion and part eagle – have looked out across the parkway like silent sentinels of culture. The rebrand dares to make those sentinels dance.</p>\n\n<p>In its new form, PhAM is deliberately more flexible, less marble, more motion. The logo revives the griffin but places it with a bold, circular emblem that is unmistakably digital. The new logo is chunkier, more assertive and designed to hold its own on a phone screen.</p>\n\n<p>Like the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiktok/2025/05/23/the-art-of-the-mets-digital-storytelling/\">digital overhaul</a> in New York, the Philadelphia Art Museum is leaning into an era where visitors first encounter culture through screens, not doors. As the Met’s former chief digital officer Sree Sreenivasan stated, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/how-museums-are-using-technology/\">“Our competition is Netflix and Candy Crush</a>,” not other museums.</p>\n\n<p>The PhAM’s visual language is redesigned for environments filled with scrolling, swiping and sharing. Through this marketer’s lens, the goal is clear: to ensure that the museum lives not only on the parkway but in the algorithm.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A wall with colorful white, pink, blue, teal and black signs with modern graphic designs\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697892/original/file-20251022-74-ky494l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The museum’s new branding and signage aims to appeal to younger and more diverse audiences.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://press.philamuseum.org/the-philadelphia-museum-of-art-is-now-the-philadelphia-art-museum/\">Rob Cusick/Philadelphia Art Museum</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A little younger, more cheeky</h2>\n\n<p>There is something refreshing about a legacy institution willing to meet its existing or future audience where they already are. The museum’s leadership <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/10/08/philadelphia-art-museum-rebrand/\">frames the change as a broader renewal</a> – a commitment to accessibility, community and openness. </p>\n\n<p>The rebrand showcases “Philadelphia” and it takes center stage in the new name and logo, a subtle but potent reminder that the museum’s roots are here. In the previous design, the word “Art” was much larger and more bolded than “Philadelphia.”</p>\n\n<p>And then there’s the nickname: PhAM. It’s playful – think, “Hey, fam!” or a Batman comic-style Pow! Bam! PhAM! – compact, easy to say and just cheeky enough to intrigue a new generation. It’s Instagrammable and hashtaggable. It’s got trending power. I asked a lecture hall full of marketing students in their 20s what they thought of it, and they generally loved it. They thought it was “fun,” “hip” and had enough “play” in the name to make them want to visit.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPjXGLREYYY&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>It’s also a nod to the way folks from Philly actually talk about the place. No one in Philadelphia ever says, “Let’s go to the Museum of Art.” They call it “the Art Museum.” The brand finally caught up with the vernacular.</p>\n\n<h2>A balancing act</h2>\n\n<p>Rebrands in the cultural sector are rarely simple makeovers. They are identity reckonings. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2018/10/01/tania-bruguera-renames-tate-modern-after-local-london-activist-as-part-of-turbine-hall-commission\">Tate Modern</a> in London mastered this dance in 2016 when it modernized its graphics and digital outreach while keeping the weight of its bones intact. </p>\n\n<p>Others have stumbled.  </p>\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.jetset.nl/archive/whitney-museum-identity\">Whitney Museum</a> in New York debuted a minimalist “W” in 2013, <a href=\"https://openjournals.neu.edu/nuwriting/home/article/view/136/124\">reactions were mixed</a>. To me, it felt more like a tech startup than a place of art.</p>\n\n<p>PhAM now faces that same paradox. How does the cultural institution appear modern without erasing its majesty? Museums, after all, trade in authority as much as accessibility. </p>\n\n<p>The new name carries subtle risks. Some longtime patrons may bristle at the casual tone. And the phrase “Museum of Art” carries an academic formality that “Art Museum” softens.</p>\n\n<p>And the more flexible a brand’s logo or voice becomes, the more it risks dissolving into the noise of digital sameness. While brands must adapt their visuals and tone to fit different social media platforms and audiences, there is a fine line between flexibility and dilution. The more a brand’s logo, voice or visual identity bends to accommodate every digital trend or platform aesthetic, the greater the risk that it loses its edge.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when too many brands adopt a minimalistic sans-serif logo – as we’ve seen with fashion brands <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/burberry-new-logo-trend/\">such as Burberry and Saint Laurent</a> – the result is a uniform aesthetic that makes it difficult for any single identity to stand out. </p>\n\n<p>Flexibility should serve differentiation, not erode it.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I appreciate how PhAM’s revival of the griffin, steeped in the building’s history, keeps the brand tethered to its architectural DNA.</p>\n\n<p>For now, the rebrand communicates both humility and confidence. It acknowledges that even icons must learn to speak new languages. The gesture isn’t just aesthetic; it’s generational. By softening its posture and modernizing its voice, the Philadelphia Art Museum appears intent on courting a new cohort of museumgoers used to stories unfolding on screens. This is a rebrand not merely for the faithful but for those who might never have thought of the museum as “for them” in the first place.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A billboard on urban street reads 'Art for all, All for art'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=459&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=459&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=459&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=577&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=577&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698426/original/file-20251024-56-5x6qry.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=577&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Philadelphia Art Museum’s new branding on display on N. 5th Street in North Philadelphia.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Sheri Lambert</span>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267945/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Sheri L.

Comparing these groups is like comparing apples and bricks: They may both be organizations, but that’s where the resemblance stops.</p>\n\n<p>Noem’s statement echoed the logic of a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/\">September 2025 Trump administration executive order</a> that designated antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization.” The order directs all relevant federal agencies to investigate and dismantle any operations, including the funding sources, linked to antifa. </p>\n\n<p>But there is no credible evidence from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-politics-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e\">the FBI</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/counterterrorism/fbi-dhs-domestic-terrorism-strategic-report.pdf/view\">Department of Homeland Security</a> that supports such a comparison. <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition\">Independent terrorism experts</a> don’t see the similarities either. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107030\">Data shows</a> that the movement can be confrontational and occasionally violent. But antifa is <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/blogs/examining-extremism/examining-extremism-antifa\">neither a terrorist network</a> nor a major source of organized lethal violence. </p>\n\n<p>Antifa, as understood by scholars and law enforcement, is <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF10839\">not an organization in any formal sense</a>. It lacks membership rolls and leadership hierarchies. It doesn’t have centralized funding. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://udayton.edu/directory/artssciences/sociology/jipson_arthur_j.php\">a scholar of social movements</a>, I know that antifa is <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/who-are-antifa-and-are-they-threat\">a decentralized movement animated by opposition to fascism</a> and far-right extremism. It’s an assortment of small groups that mobilize around specific protests or local issues. And its tactics range from peaceful counterdemonstrations to mutual aid projects.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in Portland, Oregon, local antifa activists <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49382386\">organized counterdemonstrations against far-right rallies</a> in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Antifa groups <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/hurricane-harvey-antifa-texas-flooding-antifacist-storm-relief-efforts-a7921846.html\">active in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017</a> coordinated food, supplies and <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/antifa-and-leftists-organize-mutual-aid-and-rescue-networks-in-houston/\">rescue support for affected residents</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>No evidence of terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>The FBI and DHS have classified certain anarchist or anti-fascist groups under the broad category of “domestic violent extremists.” But neither agency <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/21/instagram-posts/despite-trump-talk-antifa-has-not-been-designated-/\">nor the State Department</a> has ever previously designated antifa as a terrorist organization.</p>\n\n<p>The data on political violence reinforces this point. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman holds a yellow sign while walking with a group of people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698783/original/file-20251027-66-e0myvp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A woman holds a sign while protesting immigration raids in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Antifa&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Noah Berger</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>A 2022 report by the Counter Extremism Project found that the <a href=\"https://www.counterextremism.com/content/far-left-extremist-groups-united-states\">overwhelming majority of deadly domestic terrorist incidents</a> in the United States in recent years were linked to right-wing extremists. These groups include white supremacists and anti-government militias that promote racist or authoritarian ideologies. They reject democratic authority and often seek to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-field-guide-to-accelerationism-white-supremacist-groups-using-violence-to-spur-race-war-and-create-social-chaos-255699\">provoke social chaos or civil conflict</a> to achieve their goals.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367\">Left-wing or anarchist-affiliated violence</a>, including acts attributed to antifa-aligned people, accounts for only a small fraction of domestic extremist incidents and almost none of the fatalities. Similarly, in 2021, the <a href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/anarchistleft-wing-violent-extremism-america\">George Washington University Program on Extremism found</a> that anarchist or anti-fascist attacks are typically localized, spontaneous and lacking coordination. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the organizations Noem invoked – <a href=\"https://ctc.westpoint.edu/inside-hamas-how-it-thinks-fights-and-governs/\">Hamas</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/isis.html\">Islamic State</a> group and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/high-ranking-ms-13-fugitive-arrested-terrorism-charges\">MS-13</a> – share structural and operational characteristics that antifa lacks.</p>\n\n<p>They operate across borders and are hierarchically organized. They are also <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12549\">capable of sustained military or paramilitary operations</a>. They possess training pipelines, funding networks, propaganda infrastructure and <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/isis-declares-leader-al-baghdadi-caliph-of-the-muslims-changes-name/a-17745538\">territorial control</a>. And they have orchestrated mass casualties such as the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/11/03/grounds-concern/belgiums-counterterror-responses-paris-and-brussels-attacks\">2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels bombings</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In short, they are military or criminal organizations with strategic intent.

In a polarized media environment, such rhetoric performs a symbolic purpose. It <a href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-study-tracks-former-president-donald-trumps-weaponization-of-words\">divides the moral universe</a> into heroes and enemies, order and chaos, patriots and radicals.</p>\n\n<p>Noem’s comparison reflects a broader pattern in populist politics, where complex social movements are reduced to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/ice-videos-dhs-noem-immigration-arrests-analysis\">simple, threatening caricatures</a>. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/politics/republicans-rewrite-january-6-history-fact-check\">some Republican leaders</a> have used antifa as a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/02/how-antifa-became-a-trump-catch-all-297921\">shorthand</a> for all forms of left-wing unrest or criticism of authority. </p>\n\n<p>Antifa’s decentralized structure makes it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/us/politics/antifa-conspiracy-capitol-riot.html\">a convenient target for blame</a>. That’s because it lacks clear boundaries, leadership and accountability. So any act by someone identifying with antifa can be framed as representing the whole movement, whether or not it does. And by linking antifa to terrorist groups, Noem, the top anti-terror official in the country, turns a political talking point into a claim that appears to carry the weight of national security expertise.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this kind of rhetoric is not just that it’s inaccurate. Equating protest movements with terrorist organizations blurs important distinctions that allow <a href=\"https://home.watson.brown.edu/research/research-briefs/why-media-conflation-activism-terrorism-has-dire-consequences-case-cop-city\">democratic societies to tolerate dissent</a>. It also risks misdirecting attention and resources away from more serious threats — including organized, ideologically driven groups that remain the primary source of domestic terrorism in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, Noem’s claim reveals less about antifa and more about the <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/terrorism-and-the-politics-of-fear-9781442274525/\">political uses of fear</a>. </p>\n\n<p>By invoking the language of terrorism to describe an anti-fascist movement, she taps into a potent <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/terrorism-thing-we-have-fear-most-fear-itself\">emotional current in American politics</a>: the <a href=\"https://researchers.westernsydney.edu.au/en/publications/two-leaders-two-wars-a-psychological-analysis-of-fear-and-anger-c/\">desire for clear enemies</a>, simple explanations and moral certainty in times of division.</p>\n\n<p>But effective homeland security depends on evidence, not ideology. To equate street-level confrontation with organized terror is not only wrong — it <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/rhetoric-terrorism-and-counterterrorism\">undermines the credibility</a> of the very <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/terrorism-and-state-critique-domination-through-fear\">institutions charged with protecting the public</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267514/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Art Jipson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Teachers and librarians will label and organize books into color-coded bins, based on their level of difficulty. This practice helps ensure that no child strays into a book judged too difficult for them to easily follow. Teachers then divide their class into reading groups based on the book levels the students are assigned. </p>\n\n<p>Most elementary teachers and middle school teachers say they try to teach at their students’ reading levels, <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED598894.pdf\">as do more than 40% of high school English teachers</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>This approach might sound good, but it means that students work with books they can already read pretty well. And they might not have very much to learn from those books. </p>\n\n<p>New research challenges these widely used instructional practices. My July 2025 book, “Leveled Reading, Leveled Lives,” <a href=\"https://hep.gse.harvard.edu/9798895570036/leveled-reading-leveled-lives/\">explains that students</a> learn more when taught with more difficult texts. In other words, this popular approach to teaching has been holding kids back rather than helping them succeed. </p>\n\n<p>Many students will read at levels that match the grades they are in. But kids who cannot already read those grade-level texts with high comprehension are demoted to below-grade-level books in the hopes that this will help them make more progress. </p>\n\n<p>Often, parents do not know that their children are reading at a level lower than the grade they are in.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps that is why, while more than <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading/?grade=4\">one-third of American elementary students read below grade level</a>, 90% of parents think their kids <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/513881/parents-perspectives-on-grades.aspx\">are at or above grade level</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s in a reading level?</h2>\n\n<p>The approach to “just right” reading has long roots in American history. </p>\n\n<p>In the 1840s, U.S. schools were divided into grade levels based on children’s ages. In response, textbook publishing companies organized their reading textbooks the same way. There was a first grade book, a second grade book and so on. </p>\n\n<p>These reading levels admittedly were somewhat arbitrary. The grade-level reading diet proposed by one company may have differed from its competitors’ offerings.</p>\n\n<p>That changed in 2010 with the <a href=\"https://www.thecorestandards.org/\">Common Core state standards</a>, a multistate educational initiative that set K-12 learning goals in reading and math in more than 40 states.  </p>\n\n<p>At the time, too many students were leaving high school without the ability to read the kinds of books and papers used in college, the workplace or the military. </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, Common Core <a href=\"https://www.thecorestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Appendix-A-New-Research-on-Text-Complexity-revised.pdf\">set ranges of text levels</a> for each grade to ensure that by high school graduation, students would be able to easily handle reading they will encounter in college and other places after graduation. Many states have <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/common-core-revisions-what-are-states-really-changing/2017/01\">replaced or revised those standards</a> over the past 15 years, but most continue to keep those text levels as a key learning goal.  </p>\n\n<p>That means that most states have set reading levels that their students should be able to accomplish by each grade. Students who do this should graduate from high school with sufficient literacy to participate fully in American society. </p>\n\n<p>But this instructional level theory can stand in the way of getting kids to those goals. If students cannot already read those grade level texts reasonably well, the teacher is to provide easier books than adjusting the instruction to help them catch up.  </p>\n\n<p>But that raises a question: If children spend their time while they are in the fourth grade reading second grade books, will they ever catch up? </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two young children sit at a desk and read books.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698209/original/file-20251023-56-4h4riw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">New research suggests that children could benefit more from reading books that are slightly advanced for them, even if they cannot immediately grasp almost all of the words.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/kindergartners-jacky-vang-left-and-precious-garwoloquoi-news-photo/1156750801?adppopup=true\">Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What the research says</h2>\n\n<p>For more than 40 years, there was little research into the effectiveness of teaching reading with books that were easy for kids to follow.

These studies show that teaching students at their reading levels, rather than their grade levels, either offers no benefit or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220670009598749\">can slow how much children learn</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2000, the federal government has <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL31241.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">spent tens of billions of dollars</a> trying to increase children’s literacy rates.

The U.S. was seemingly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/us/politics/trump-speaks-with-taiwans-leader-a-possible-affront-to-china.html\">pushing then to bolster</a> its assurance – falling short of commitment – to help Taiwan pursue a path of autonomy, but not outright independence.</p>\n\n<p>During the Biden administration, the U.S. position on Taiwan was shaped by other, wider China-U.S. events, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/us-intelligence-officials-determined-chinese-spy-balloon-used-us-inter-rcna131150\">spy balloon</a> and then the controversial <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-nancy-pelosis-visit-to-taiwan-puts-the-white-house-in-delicate-straits-of-diplomacy-with-china-188116\">visit to Taiwan by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> – both of which damaged Washington-Beijing relations and resulted in an uptick in tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A person steps on an image of a woman's face.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698829/original/file-20251028-56-cxeu3l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A pro-China supporter steps on a defaced photo of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a protest in Hong Kong against her visit to Taiwan on Aug. 3, 2022.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/pro-china-supporter-steps-on-a-defaced-photo-of-u-s-house-news-photo/1412613157?adppopup=true\">Anthony Kwan/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Trump’s current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has also traditionally been very hawkish on Taiwan – but there is a wider sense that this <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3313432/trump-xi-call-china-hawk-rubio-missing-action-leaders-rekindle-trade-hopes\">hawkish approach isn’t dominant</a> in the second Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p>Much of this centers on Trump himself and questions over whether he is looking to find a different compromise agreement with China that includes the U.S. stance on Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>Evidence of this could be seen earlier this year when the Trump administration prevented Taiwan President William Lai Ching-te <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/world/asia/trump-taiwan-china.html\">from stopping off in New York</a> on his way to Central and South America – something that could be interpreted as a concession to Beijing. Similarly, the Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/18/trump-taiwan-arms-sales-military-aid/\">nixed US$400 million of U.S. weapons</a> earmarked for Taiwan over the summer.</p>\n\n<p>The other main difference now, compared with when Xi and Trump last met, is that they are dealing with a politically different Taiwan. In 2019, the U.S. and China were dealing with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16464515\">Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen</a>, who had a practical and flexible approach to the issue of Taiwanese independence – something that Beijing vehemently opposes.</p>\n\n<p>The new Taiwanese president, Lai Ching-te, hasn’t pushed for independence, but certainly a lot of analysts have said he is <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/taiwans-new-president-has-a-nationalist-reputation-it-could-be-an-asset-when-dealing-with-beijing/\">more enthusiastic</a> in wanting to stress the separation of Taiwan from the mainland. That is a position that the U.S. doesn’t want to give any signal that it is supporting.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Beijing has continued to push hard on Taiwan – days before the Trump-Xi meeting, Chinese state media <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ahead-trump-xi-meeting-china-says-bombers-flew-near-taiwan-2025-10-27/\">announced that “confrontation drills</a>” involving Chinese H-6K bombers had taken place near Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>But this is typical. The Chinese government has traditionally pushed a maximalist line on Taiwan before meetings and then scaled back rhetoric during negotiations. </p>\n\n<p>So what does Beijing want? In recent weeks and months, the Chinese Communist Party has indicated that it would like <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/xi-jinping-donald-trump-china-taiwan-south-korea-4638954c\">Washington’s phrasing on Taiwan to change</a> from “the U.S. does not support independence” to “the U.S. opposes independence.”</p>\n\n<p>But I would not expect any move from Washington in the short term on this. The preferred settlement on Taiwan for the short to medium term is status quo. However, that gets harder and harder due to China’s increased presence in Taiwanese air and naval space.</p>\n\n<h2>Trade: Trump tools are blunted</h2>\n\n<p>In 2019, the U.S. and China were in the process of working out a “<a href=\"https://ustr.gov/phase-one\">phase one” economic and trade agreement</a>, which was supposed to develop into a much bigger deal.</p>\n\n<p>But the wider deal didn’t come about. Both sides were finding it hard to achieve the terms of the deal, and then the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2021.101135\">pandemic in 2020 threw global trade</a> and supply chains out of kilter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now in a very different tariff environment than during the first Trump administration – tariffs are now universal, and Trump wants everyone to pay them.</p>\n\n<p>That creates in the short term a harder negotiating position for Trump – there is less incentive for U.S. allies to help pressure China with additional restrictions of their own. Take the U.K, for example. In the first Trump administration, a succession of phone calls from the White House <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/donald-trump-boris-johnson-huawei\">pressured the Boris Johnson government</a> to ban Chinese giant Huawei from having a slice of the U.K. telecommunications market. But at that point, there was no U.S.-imposed <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10240/\">10% tariff on the U.K</a>. And while 10% is low compared with that imposed elsewhere, it is still an obstacle when trying to impose pressure on allies and partners against China.</p>\n\n<p>And compared with 2019, the vulnerability of supply chains has become even more apparent. We have seen evidence of that with China’s actions over restricting rare earth materials. But in the intervening years, Beijing has inserted itself even more so into global supply chains – making it harder for Trump to also pressure American companies. </p>\n\n<p>Take Apple. It has, under pressure from the Trump administration, moved more of its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-aims-source-all-us-iphones-india-pivot-away-china-ft-reports-2025-04-25/\">production of iPhones to India</a> – a rival to China. But in practice, iPhone component production and assembly still take place in China – as no other place can do the job with such precision and volume.</p>\n\n<h2>Russia: China continues balancing act</h2>\n\n<p>China’s approach to its relationship with Russia hasn’t really changed since the first Trump term – Beijing still makes its decisions on Russia with little regard to what the U.S. thinks.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Russia did not <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po\">fully invade Ukraine until 2022</a> – three years after Xi and Trump last met. But by then there had been the <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russias-annexation-of-crimea/\">invasion of Crimea in 2014</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/the-2008-russo-georgian-war-putins-green-light/\">Georgia in 2008</a>. </p>\n\n<p>China didn’t condemn Russia for those actions, but it noticeably <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464002-un-security-council-action-crimea-referendum-blocked\">abstained in the U.N.</a> on those issues. And it never acknowledged Russia’s annexation of those areas.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly today, Beijing has never acknowledged Russia’s claims over the parts of eastern Ukraine it occupies.</p>\n\n<p>So China has continued its balanced, cautious position. Its priority is not offending Russia, which it increasingly eyes as a key market for Chinese goods. It provides tech that has dual-use capability useful for Russia’s military sector, and oil – but drives a hard bargain. These are no “mate’s rates.”</p>\n\n<p>China wants nothing to disturb that trade, so it has been at first suspicious, then relieved by the relative warmth of the Trump administration toward Russia.</p>\n\n<p>As to the war itself, China evidently understands that Russia may not win the war, but it is able to maintain it – and that is just fine. An isolated Russia, dependent on Chinese goods, is to Beijing’s benefit.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268471/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rana Mitter does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Near the end of play, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw a perfect pass to receiver Brian Jones Jr. to secure a critical first down. Out of the blue, a student groaned and said that he’d lost US$50 on that throw.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of that moment because it revealed how ubiquitous sports betting has become, how much the types of bets have changed over time, and – given these trends – how it’s naive to think players won’t continue to be tempted to game the system.  </p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"D0Ren\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D0Ren/5/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>The prop bet hits it big</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve been following the evolution of sports gambling for about a decade in my position as chair of Penn State’s sports journalism program.</p>\n\n<p>Back when legal American sports betting was mostly confined to Las Vegas, the standard bets tended to be tied to picking a winner or <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/point-spread-over-under\">which team would cover a point spread</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But ahead of <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198601260chi.htm\">the 1986 Super Bowl</a> between the Chicago Bears and the overmatched New England Patriots, casinos offered bets on whether Bears defensive lineman – and occasional running back – <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/prop-betting-ncaa-super-bowl-las-vegas-6e12af158d4fc1e36f1e5d2161d8519c\">William “Refrigerator” Perry would score a touchdown</a>. The excitement around that sideshow kept fan interest going during a 46-10 blowout. </p>\n\n<p>Perry did end up scoring, and <a href=\"https://outplayed.com/blog/what-is-a-prop-bet\">the prop bet</a> took off from there.</p>\n\n<p>Prop bets are wagers that depend on an outcome within a game but not its final result. They can often involve an athlete’s individual performance in some statistical category – for instance, how many yards a running back will rush for, how many rebounds a basketball center will secure, or how many strikeouts a pitcher will have. They’ve become routine offerings on sports betting menus.</p>\n\n<p>For example: As I write this, I am looking at a FanDuel account I opened years ago, seeing that, for the Green Bay Packers-Pittsburgh Steelers game currently in progress, I can place a wager on which player will score a touchdown, how many yards each quarterback will throw for and much, much more. As the game progresses, the odds constantly shift – allowing for what are called “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/live-betting-definition-5217206\">live bets</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Returning to my student who lost the bet on Lawrence’s pass completion: It’s possible he’d placed a bet on Lawrence to throw fewer than a set number of yards. Or he could have been part of a fantasy league, which is also dependent on individual player performances.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, a problem with prop bets, from an anti-corruption perspective, is that an individual can often control the outcome. You don’t need a group of players to be in on it – which is what happened during <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sports-gambling-creates-a-windfall-but-raises-questions-of-integrity-here-are-three-lessons-from-historic-sports-betting-scandals-227138\">the infamous Black Sox Scandal</a>, when eight players on the Chicago White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-betting-scheme-indictment.html\">In the indictment against him</a>, Rozier is accused of telling a co-defendant to pass along information to particular bettors that he planned to leave a March 2023 game early – a move everyone involved knew meant he would not reach his statistical benchmarks for the game. They could then place bets that he wouldn’t hit those marks.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1981827342495523232&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>In baseball, meanwhile, Luis Ortiz of the Cleveland Guardians was placed on leave during the 2025 season and is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/guardians-ortiz-06134e96597c96df1e76c5a96141de53\">under investigation</a> for possibly illegally wagering on the outcome of two pitches he threw. MLB authorities are essentially trying to determine if he deliberately threw balls as opposed to strikes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4VH9cqCrjOc\">in two instances</a>. (Yes, prop bets have become so granular that you can even bet on whether a pitcher will throw a ball or a strike on an individual pitch.) </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1940863871298031684&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>An exploding market with no end in sight</h2>\n\n<p>The popularity of prop bets feeds into a worldwide sports gambling industry that has experienced explosive growth <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/sports-betting-market-report#\">and shows no sign of slowing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-b1320e074d4d421a807a8af32c961b9d\">ruled that states could decide</a> on whether to allow sports betting, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-states-where-sports-betting-is-legal-after-major-nba-arrests-10932258\">39 states plus the District of Columbia have done so</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The leagues and media are more than just bystanders. FanDuel and DraftKings are official sports betting partners <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/draftkings-fanduel-become-nbas-co-official-sports-betting-partners\">of the NBA</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31264425/nfl-partner-bookmakers-caesars-entertainment-draftkings-fanduel\">and the NFL</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the days after the Supreme Court ruling, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-states-legalize-sports-betting-will-sports-media-go-all-in-98686\">I wondered whether</a> journalists would embrace sports betting. These days, ESPN not only has a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/watch/series/d2f11be1-5d15-4c6a-bda3-112579d7e9eb/espn-bet-live\">betting show</a>, but it also has a betting app. </p>\n\n<p>According to the American Gaming Association, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/43922129/us-sports-betting-industry-posts-record-137b-revenue-24\">sportsbooks collected a record $13.71 billion in revenue in 2024</a> from about $150 billion in wagers. <a href=\"https://sri.siena.edu/tag/gambling/\">A study released in February 2025</a> by Siena and St. Bonaventure universities found that nearly half of American men have an online sports betting account. </p>\n\n<p>But those figures don’t begin to touch the worldwide sports betting market, especially the illegal one. The United Nations, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107472\">in a 2021 report</a>, reported that up to $1.7 trillion is wagered annually in illegal betting markets. </p>\n\n<p>The U.N. report warned that it had found a “staggering scale, manifestation, and complexity of corruption and organized crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels.” </p>\n\n<h2>Who’s the boss?</h2>\n\n<p>In early October 2025, I attended a conference of <a href=\"https://www.playthegame.org/\">Play the Game</a>, a Denmark-based organization that promotes “democratic values in world sports.” Its occasional gatherings attract experts from around the world who are interested in keeping sports fair and safe for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most sobering topics was illegal, online sportsbooks that feature wagering on all levels of sport, from the lowest levels of European soccer on up. </p>\n\n<p>It sounded somewhat familiar. This summer at the Little League World Series, which my students covered for The Associated Press, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/little-league-world-series-gambling-betting-3c10299c2782c113cf90545a2d87faec\">managers complained</a> about offshore sportsbooks offering lines on the tournament, which is played by 12-year-old amateurs. </p>\n\n<p>And with so much illegal wagering in the world, the issue of match fixing was bound to come up.</p>\n\n<p>One session screened a recent German documentary on match fixing. Meanwhile, Anca-Maria Gherghel, a Ph.D. candidate at Sheffield Hallam University and senior researcher for EPIC Global Solutions, both in northern England, told me how she had interviewed a professional female soccer player for a team in Cyprus. The player described how she and her teammates were routinely approached with lucrative offers to throw matches.</p>\n\n<p>Put it all together – the vast sums of money at play and the relative ease of fixing a prop bet, let alone a match – and you cannot be surprised at the NBA scandal.</p>\n\n<p>I used to think that gambling was just a segment of the larger sports industry. Now, I wonder whether I had it exactly backward. </p>\n\n<p>Has sports just become a segment of the larger gambling industry?</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268340/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>John Affleck does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

It’s a sharp reminder that the same technology driving efficiency is also redefining what it takes to keep a job.</p>\n\n<p>And Accenture isn’t alone. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-ceo-says-ai-has-replaced-hundreds-of-workers-but-created-new-programming-sales-jobs-54ea6b58\">IBM has already replaced hundreds of roles</a> with AI systems, while creating new jobs in sales and marketing. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-cuts-more-jobs-this-time-books-division-2025-06-06\">Amazon cut staff</a> even as it expands teams that build and manage AI tools. Across industries, from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-09/wall-street-expected-to-shed-200-000-jobs-as-ai-erodes-roles\">banks</a> to <a href=\"https://healthexec.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-staffing/largest-physician-owned-health-system-utah-braces-ai-driven-layoffs\">hospitals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/ai-advertising-industry-google-facebook-meta-ads\">creative companies</a>, workers and managers alike are trying to understand which roles will disappear, which will evolve and which new ones will emerge.</p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/murugananandarajan\">research and teach</a> at Drexel University’s <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/\">LeBow College of Business</a>, studying how technology changes work and decision-making. My students often ask how they can stay employable in the age of AI. Executives ask me how to build trust in technology that seems to move faster than people can adapt to it. In the end, both groups are really asking the same thing: Which skills matter most in an economy where machines can learn? </p>\n\n<p>To answer this, I analyzed data from two surveys my colleagues and I conducted over this summer. For the first, the <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/applied-ai-business-analytics/lebow-precisely#research\">Data Integrity &amp; AI Readiness Survey</a>, we asked 550 companies across the country how they use and invest in AI. For the second, the <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/companies-careers/center-career-readiness/college-hiring-outlook\">College Hiring Outlook Survey</a>, we looked at how 470 employers viewed entry-level hiring, workforce development and AI skills in candidates. These studies show both sides of the equation: those building AI and those learning to work with it. </p>\n\n<h2>AI is everywhere, but are people ready?</h2>\n\n<p>More than half of organizations told us that AI now drives daily decision-making, yet only 38% believe their employees are fully prepared to use it. This gap is reshaping today’s job market. AI isn’t just replacing workers; it’s revealing who’s ready to work alongside it.</p>\n\n<p>Our data also shows a contradiction. While many companies now depend on AI internally, only 27% of recruiters say they’re comfortable with applicants using AI tools for tasks such as writing resumes or researching salary ranges. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the same tools companies trust for business decisions still raise doubts when job seekers use them for career advancement. Until that view changes, even skilled workers will keep getting mixed messages about what “<a href=\"https://oecd.ai/en/working-group-responsible-ai\">responsible AI use</a>” really means.</p>\n\n<p>In the Data Integrity &amp; AI Readiness Survey, this readiness gap showed up most clearly in customer-facing and operational jobs such as marketing and sales. These are the same areas where automation is advancing quickly, and layoffs tend to occur when technology evolves faster than people can adapt.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we found that many employers haven’t updated their degree or credential requirements. They’re still hiring for yesterday’s resumes while, tomorrow’s work demands fluency in AI. The problem isn’t that people are being replaced by AI; it’s that technology is evolving faster than most workers can adapt.</p>\n\n<h2>Fluency and trust: The real foundations of adaptability</h2>\n\n<p>Our research suggests that the skills most closely linked with adaptability share one theme, what I call “human-AI fluency.” This means being able to work with smart systems, question their results and keep learning as things change.</p>\n\n<p>Across companies, the biggest challenges lie in expanding AI, ensuring compliance with ethical and regulatory standards and connecting AI to real business goals. These hurdles aren’t about coding; they’re about good judgment.</p>\n\n<p>In my classes, I emphasize that the future will favor people who can turn machine output into useful human insight. I call this digital bilingualism: the ability to fluently navigate both human judgment and machine logic.</p>\n\n<p>What management experts call “reskilling” – or <a href=\"https://online.stanford.edu/what-upskilling-and-reskilling\">learning new skills to adapt to a new role</a> or major changes in an old one – works best when people feel safe to learn. In our <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/applied-ai-business-analytics/lebow-precisely#research\">Data Integrity &amp; AI Readiness Survey</a>, organizations with strong governance and high trust were nearly twice as likely to report gains in performance and innovation. The data suggests that when people trust their leaders and systems, they’re more willing to experiment and learn from mistakes. In that way, trust turns technology from something to fear into something to learn from, giving employees the confidence to adapt.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/companies-careers/center-career-readiness/college-hiring-outlook\">College Hiring Outlook Survey</a>, about 86% of employers now offer internal training or online boot camps, yet only 36% say AI-related skills are important for entry-level roles. Most training still focuses on traditional skills rather than those needed for emerging AI jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The most successful companies make learning part of the job itself. They build opportunities to learn into real projects and encourage employees to experiment. I often remind leaders that the goal isn’t just to train people to use AI but to help them think alongside it. This is how trust becomes the foundation for growth, and how reskilling helps retain employees.</p>\n\n<h2>The new rules of hiring</h2>\n\n<p>In my view, the companies leading in AI aren’t just cutting jobs; they’re redefining them. To succeed, I believe companies will need to hire people who can connect technology with good judgment, question what AI produces, explain it clearly and turn it into business value. </p>\n\n<p>In companies that are putting AI to work most effectively, hiring isn’t just about resumes anymore. What matters is how people apply traits like curiosity and judgment to intelligent tools. I believe these trends are leading to new hybrid roles such as AI translators, who help decision-makers understand what AI insights mean and how to act on them, and digital coaches, who teach teams to work alongside intelligent systems. Each of these roles connects human judgment with machine intelligence, showing how future jobs will blend technical skills with human insight.</p>\n\n<p>That blend of judgment and adaptability is the new competitive advantage. The future won’t just reward the most technical workers, but those who can turn intelligence – human or artificial – into real-world value.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267376/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Murugan Anandarajan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Like trees and flowers, we are beings who also need winter to rest and summer to bloom.</p>\n\n<p>As far as we humans know, we are the only species that chooses to fight against our biological presets, regularly changing our clocks, miserably dragging ourselves into and out of bed at unnatural hours.</p>\n\n<p>The reason, many scholars agree, is that capitalism teaches humans that they are <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816650460/when-species-meet/\">separate from, and superior to, nature</a> – like the point on top of a pyramid. That, and I argue, that capitalism wants people to work the same number of hours year-round, no matter the season. This mindset runs counter to the way Indigenous people have lived for thousands of years. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A group of people stand around an open circle on an island, as the Sun rises behind a bridge across the water.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668819/original/file-20250519-62-ih6fq8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A large gathering of people celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day in 2024, by watching the Sun rise over San Francisco Bay.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/hundreds-of-people-are-gathered-in-alcatraz-island-early-news-photo/2186655146\">Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The nature of time and work</h2>\n\n<p>Indigenous views of the world are not the pyramids or lines of capitalism but the circles and cycles of life.</p>\n\n<p>Concretely, time correlates with terrestrial and celestial changes. Historic records and oral interviews document that in traditional Indigenous cultures of the past, human activity was <a href=\"https://pimaki.ca/the-lunar-calendar-explained/\">scheduled according to nature’s recurring patterns</a>. So for example, a meeting might have been scheduled not at 4 p.m. on Thursday, but rather at the next full moon. Everyone knew well in advance when that would arise and could plan accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>Such an acute sensitivity to nature’s calendar has symbolic meaning, too. To look up and see the Moon in the sky at night is to see the same Moon that someone once saw centuries ago and someone else will hopefully see centuries into the future. Time is interwoven with nature in a sense that far exceeds Western understanding. It embodies past, present and future all at once. Time is life.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrMJ73nFV_w?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The 2015 movie ‘El Abrazo de la Serpiente (Embrace of the Serpent)’ examines the relationship between Indigenous cultures of knowing and colonizing forces.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In this Indigenous context, daylight saving time is nonsensical – if not outright comical. Time can’t be changed any more than a clock’s hands can grab the Sun and move its position in the sky. The Sun will continue to cycle at its gravitational will for generations – and economic systems – to come.</p>\n\n<p>Like time, Indigenous approaches to work are also more expansive than the capitalist economy’s. They validate and value <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq97NEx3eis&amp;t=843s\">all life-sustaining activities as work</a>. Taking care of oneself, of the sick, of the elderly, of the young, of the land, or even merely resting, for example, are equally <a href=\"https://asset.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/EJB34MNT52NQW84/R/file-9eee7.pdf\">valuable activities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because the objective of most Indigenous economies is not to increase an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/an-economy-focused-solely-on-growth-is-environmentally-and-socially-unsustainable-39761\">economist-invented measurement of production</a> by working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Rather, their goal is to find and generate a holistic <a href=\"https://rapidtransition.org/stories/the-rights-of-nature-in-bolivia-and-ecuador/\">well-being for all</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Daylight saving time is exclusively designed for 9-to-5 workers. It attempts to <a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/who-benefits-from-daylight-saving-time/2024/03/06/\">boost economic activity</a> by giving them, and them alone, more light. Think about it: Care workers, who are predominantly women, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/desa/world%E2%80%99s-women-2020\">work beyond daylight hours year-round</a>. Where is their temporal accommodation? Though likely not malicious or even purposeful, the political intervention of daylight saving time ignores the massive workforce that <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/products/74-capitalism-in-the-web-of-life\">operates on the periphery of the mainstream economy</a>. In some ways, it reinforces the discriminatory idea that only some workers are worthy of economic recognition and accommodation. </p>\n\n<p>In this sense, daylight saving time raises the question: Does the economy really need that extra hour of sunshine and worker productivity? Traditional economic philosophies would likely answer no out of principle; they may see daylight saving time as trespassing the biophysical, ethical and sacred limits of the world ecology by encouraging cultures of overwork and overconsumption. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A person swipes a card in a machine on a wall.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/668510/original/file-20250516-68-dk133w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A worker swipes a time card to clock in at the beginning of their shift.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/warehouse-worker-clocking-in-royalty-free-image/1351437604\">halbergman/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The working of time and nature</h2>\n\n<p>Since the invention of the clock, capitalism has <a href=\"https://marxandphilosophy.org.uk/book/7410_time-capitalism-and-alienation-a-sociohistorical-inquiry-into-the-making-of-modern-time/\">increasingly treated time as an inanimate object</a> largely independent of the environment.</p>\n\n<p>While the rest of nature rises and slumbers to lunar and solar cycles, humans work and sleep to the resetting of their artificial clocks.</p>\n\n<p>In their 2016 book “<a href=\"https://utppublishing.com/doi/book/10.3138/9781487521851\">The Slow Professor</a>,” humanities scholars Maggie Berg and Barbara K. Seeber connect this objectification of time to an inhumane culture of work. </p>\n\n<p>Modern workers, they write, are increasingly expected to treat time as a numerical asset that can be managed, measured and controlled. Time for rest and relaxation has no countable home in the capitalist economy of life. </p>\n\n<p>There are certainly practical benefits to using time to measure and monitor economic activities – such as knowing the precise time a meeting is scheduled to start and end. But Berg’s and Seeber’s work reveals how that reasonable practicality has been subverted to hold workers captive within what I argue is an unsustainable, unnatural and exploitative environment. Work time and life time have <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/products/2315-24-7\">blurred into one</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In capitalism, work is expected to grow infinitely, despite existing within a finite world inhabited by limited beings. At a time when human activity depletes the world’s ecology – rather than sustaining it as it once did – this around-the-clock approach to work is <a href=\"https://www.lacisreview.org/blog-issue-01/toxic-work-in-post-2008-spain\">simply incompatible with nature</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, daylight saving time reproduces the same destructive logic that has led humans and nonhumans into the <a href=\"https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=779\">present socio-ecological crises</a>. Disobeying and dominating the laws, rhythms and shape of nature, as seen in the seasonal exploitation of human energy and labor via daylight saving time, perpetuates the unparalleled <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/40603\">social</a> and <a href=\"https://reachareader.com/products/the-sixth-extinction-an-unnatural-history-used-paperback-elizabeth-kolbert?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=9c-bookstore&amp;utm_term=dynamic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17058005688&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACUpomFhbGFZ_DITSS2EM246JnNnf&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwoZbBBhDCARIsAOqMEZUD0qBdHU8aMENQ75fgxUVTGS3DLioWo6xmTXsYKCOwpEXWeOpXYdwaAlS4EALw_wcB\">environmental</a> decline uniquely characteristic to the current capitalist era.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking backward, progressing forward</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike the relatively recent inception of capitalism, Indigenous wisdom espouses a set of philosophies as old as time.

Since 2019, <a href=\"https://www.nchfa.com/news/policy-matters-blog/new-report-us-housing-market-finds-record-numbers-across-three-key-metrics\">home prices are up 60%</a> nationwide. <a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_The_State_of_the_Nations_Housing_2025.pdf\">A record-high 22 million renters</a> are “cost-burdened” – spending more than 30% of their income on housing. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, stagnant wages, limited housing supply and lagging federal assistance have helped leave more than <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2025/who-is-homeless-in-the-united-states-a-2025-update\">770,000 Americans homeless</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these varied reasons, Vice President JD Vance has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-debate-immigration-housing-prices-real-estate-federal-reserve/\">blamed the housing affordability crisis on undocumented immigrants</a>. In August 2025, he attributed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=628636520304959\">rising housing costs</a> to immigration: “You cannot flood the United States of America with … people who have no legal right to be here, have them compete against young American families for homes, and not expect the price to skyrocket.”</p>\n\n<p>Deportations, he argued, would lower housing prices. “Why has housing leveled off over the past six months? I really believe the main driver is … negative net migration.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite Vance’s claims, research shows that <a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/role-recent-immigrant-surge-housing-costs\">immigration is not a substantial cause of unaffordable housing</a>. In fact, studies have found that deportations <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/events/2024/housing-demand-workshop/7b_LaborShortages_Zhang#:%7E:text=Treated%20counties%20experience%20large%20and,both%20extensive%20and%20intensive%20margins\">exacerbate housing shortages</a> through reductions in the construction workforce, which lead to lower production of housing units and higher prices.</p>\n\n<p>From this perspective, its hard to see the administration’s deportation policy as a real effort to solve the housing crisis. Rather, it is using the housing crisis as a way to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-deportations-will-lower-housing-costs-the-reality-is-complicated-124024709.html\">justify mass deportations</a> to the public.</p>\n\n<p>The current administration’s anti-immigrant housing policy reflects a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-next-hud-secretary-would-have-a-lot-to-do-to-address-the-history-of-racist-housing-policy-and-trumps-own-comments-and-history-suggest-thats-unlikely-240646\">long history of xenophobia in housing</a>. As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HhjS8H8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra\">a sociologist of housing</a>, I’ve traced <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/indefensible-spaces/paper\">the history of racial segregation in housing in Los Angeles County</a>. I have found that the same far-right groups that sought to defeat public housing construction and maintain racially restrictive agreements in post-World War II Los Angeles also advocated to ban immigrants from U.S. housing programs.</p>\n\n<h2>Earlier anti-immigrant housing plans</h2>\n\n<p>Among the leaders of these efforts was the far-right politician and activist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/11/archives/gerald-lk-smith-still-in-business-rightist-continues-to-print.html\">Gerald L.K. Smith</a>. Described in 1976 by historian John Morton Blum as “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/geraldlksmithmin00glen/page/212/mode/2up?q=fascist\">the most infamous American fascist</a>,” Smith helped bridge the American right’s 1940s <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300260977/taking-america-back/\">conspiratorial and isolationist America First era</a> and its 1960s anti-civil rights era. </p>\n\n<p>Smith traveled the country advocating a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Gerald_L_K_Smith/NvZabkDqcMoC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Christian nationalist vision for American society</a>, offering a religious justification for anti-communism and opposition to civil rights.

His efforts were part of a broader environment in which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0096144206297135\">public officials</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/41171049\">local media</a> worked to stop construction of public housing in Los Angeles in the 1950s, accusing its proponents of communism. </p>\n\n<h2>Recent anti-immigrant policy in housing</h2>\n\n<p>State and federal policymakers have also incorporated anti-immigrant stances into American housing policy over the past half-century.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/senate-bill/2719\">1980 Housing and Community Development Act</a> was the first federal legislation to specifically bar undocumented immigrants from public housing programs. Welfare reform in 1996 further restricted public housing assistance to <a href=\"https://tracreports.org/tracker/dynadata/2016_02/RL31753.pdf\">only legal permanent residents and those with asylum or refugee status</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Echoing the <a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/bctw19&amp;div=8&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=oPqOsOl9lQQAAAAA:N1EW92NY2EcYtDTXTSpiPUK55RvmUpLcEhYxy6Ubpw1Px9oWDKqwapJ1v94ZCNIwteCfQFM1X9c\">alien land laws of the late 1800s</a> that prohibited foreign property ownership, policymakers in the 2000s in states such as Pennsylvania and Texas passed laws <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/hazleton-immigration-ordinance-began-bang-goes-out-whimper\">forcing landlords to check immigration status</a> as a condition of rental – though this was struck down by the courts. </p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/poverty-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/07/159-Ayano-Tenants-Without-Rights.pdf\">immigrant tenants experience fewer housing rights</a> than citizens. These inequalities fall particularly hard on unauthorized immigrants who <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2020.1848898\">experience high rates of housing cost burden</a>, crowding and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.07.011\">poor housing conditions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration aims to expand restrictions on immigrants in public housing even further. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/trump-revisits-a-first-term-goal-cutting-housing-aid-for-immigrants\">in the process</a> of adopting rules that will <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/07/22/hud-immigration-mixed-status-eviction/\">evict entire families</a> if even one member is ineligible for assistance based on immigration status. Current law allows those families to live in public housing, while prorating their benefits to account for an ineligible member. </p>\n\n<p>From Smith to Vance, anti-immigrant housing policies have been cast as a way for citizens to get more housing. But they fail to prevent or solve <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-01/goldman-says-looser-land-rules-may-ease-us-s-housing-squeeze?srnd=phx-markets\">the housing shortage driving the crisis</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Trump administration’s effort to evict mixed status families from public housing will affect <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/hud-public-housing-immigrants.html\">roughly 25,000 households</a>. Setting aside the fact that those families may then be made homeless, that number is <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801478284/new-deal-ruins/#bookTabs=1\">only one-tenth the amount of housing</a> that the U.S. has lost due to the defunding and demolishing of public housing since 1990.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A construction worker walks in the frame of a house.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=434&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=434&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=434&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694395/original/file-20251003-56-4jz7tf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Studies show that deportations can reduce the housing construction workforce, which lowers the number of units built and increases costs.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=housing%20construction&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/Laura Rauch</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Indeed, many of the Trump administration’s immigration and economic policies are likely to exacerbate the housing crisis. The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/\">Trump administration has made deportation a priority</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/ice-deportations-immigrants-trump\">significantly increased deportation rates compared to recent years</a>, while instituting historically high tariffs on imports. </p>\n\n<p>Deportations <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/events/2024/housing-demand-workshop/7b_LaborShortages_Zhang#:%7E:text=Treated%20counties%20experience%20large%20and,both%20extensive%20and%20intensive%20margins\">reduce the housing construction workforce</a>, lowering the number of units built and increasing costs. And tariffs <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/house-construction-cost-tariff-change/\">raise prices on building materials</a> such as lumber, steel and aluminum. The <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/advocacy/top-priorities/building-materials-trade-policy/how-tariffs-impact-home-building\">National Association of Home Builders</a> estimates that recent tariffs have raised building costs by US$10,900 per home.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/doge-driven-hud-cuts-will-make-it-harder-for-people-to-afford-housing-exit-homelessness\">canceled or delayed a series of HUD grants for housing assistance programs</a>. And the Trump administration has announced <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/trump-administration-has-proposed-27-billion-cuts-block-granting-housing-assistance\">plans for more cuts</a> to the nation’s already insufficient housing assistance budget.</p>\n\n<p>Vance, like Smith before him, presents the issue like a pie, where citizens can get a larger slice only by deporting immigrants. But the reality is that the pie can be bigger: The government can fully fund the housing needs of all Americans for less than it has spent on its other priorities. The recently passed “big, beautiful bill,” for example, allocates <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex#:%7E:text=The%20biggest%20piece%20of%20the,to%20hire%2010%2C000%20new%20officers.\">more funding to border and interior enforcement</a> per year than <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48567\">key rental assistance programs, public housing and Housing Choice Vouchers</a> allocate for housing.</p>\n\n<p>In Smith’s time, everyday Americans resisted this gambit, <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.archives.csudh.edu/digital/collection/p16855coll16/id/1052/\">speaking out to protest his views</a>.

Basket weaving was an efficient way to turn one-dimensional strips into three-dimensional containers. </p>\n\n<p>This geometric benefit is a direct motivation for basket weaving, but <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/9srl-9gsc\">in our study published</a> in August 2025 in Physical Review Research, we wanted to find out whether basket weaving can provide more than aesthetic value in modern science and engineering. </p>\n\n<p>In our experiment, we compared woven and nonwoven containers that had the same overall shape and were fabricated using the same amount and type of materials. </p>\n\n<p>The “ribbons” we used were 10 millimeters wide and two-tenths of a millimeter thick. They were always woven in the same over/under/over/under pattern. We wove baskets from the flat ribbons and then created models using 3D scans of these woven containers that helped us examine the underlying similarities and differences between the woven and continuous structures.</p>\n\n<p>We found that these containers had similar stiffness to containers not made from woven materials, and they also went back to their initial shape after we bent or twisted them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693467/original/file-20250929-56-juvswo.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A figure with three panels, the first shows two nearly identical boxes, one woven and one continuous (non-woven).

These structures are made of Mylar (a type of polymer material).</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/9srl-9gsc\">Tu &amp; Filipov, 2025</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>When you place a heavy object on a woven structure, the ribbons are mainly being stretched instead of bent. This stretching makes them stiff because <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509620303045#fig0001\">ribbons are much stiffer when they are stretched</a> compared to bent. On top of that, the ribbons are not rigidly connected in woven structures, which gives them their extraordinary resilience.</p>\n\n<p>By harnessing basket-weaving techniques, engineers can potentially create better materials for cars, consumer devices such as smartwatches, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/soft-robots-of-the-future-may-depend-on-new-materials-that-conduct-electricity-sense-damage-and-self-heal-124344\">soft robots</a>, which are robots made from soft materials instead of rigid ones. Essentially, these techniques could improve any device when the material needs to be stiff and resilient. </p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Our research team is still exploring a few big, unanswered questions about these woven baskets.</p>\n\n<p>First, we want to understand how the geometry of the woven baskets determines their stiffness and resilience, and create an analytical or numerical model to describe this relationship. We’d then like to use that model to design woven structures that fit a target stiffness and resilience. Most woven baskets are handmade because their geometry is complex and <a href=\"https://www.basketweaving.com/blog/basket-weaving-today/\">difficult for a machine to manufacture</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Second, we’d like to figure out how to create a machine that can fabricate woven baskets autonomously. Automated machines can produce two-dimensional woven fabrics, but we’d like to learn how to modernize and digitalize the ancient craft of three-dimensional basket weaving.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we want to understand how to integrate electronic materials into three-dimensional basket weaving to create <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk3855\">next-generation robotic textiles</a>. These robotic textiles could sense, actuate, move around, bear a load, stay resilient to accidental overload and safely interact with humans at the same time.</p>\n\n<h2>Basket-weaving research and applications</h2>\n\n<p>Ours isn’t the only study exploring the complex geometry of basket weaving and the potential of applying basket-weaving techniques to architectural design. </p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.104301\">researchers teamed up with an artist</a> to tweak a popular basket-weaving approach, finding ways to weave the ribbons and produce any curvature they desired. Later, the same research team used this methodology to fabricate <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eml.2023.101968\">woven domes</a>. They found that they could tune the stiffness and stability of woven domes by varying the curvature of the ribbons.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3450626.3459788\">In another relevant study, researchers</a> built algorithms that optimized the size, shape and curvature of ribbons, then used those ribbons to weave together a geometrically sophisticated structure.</p>\n\n<p>Our new work and these other teams’ work is putting a modern spin on technology that has likely been around since the dawn of humanity.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265567/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Evgueni Filipov has received research funding from AFOSR. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Guowei (Wayne) Tu does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This is far greater than the 13.8 million workers who will enter the workforce with college degrees during this same time frame.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, an additional 685,000 new jobs that require college degrees – spanning from environmental positions to advanced manufacturing – will be created from now through 2032. </p>\n\n<p>The gap between those expected to leave and enter the workforce with college degrees creates a serious problem. One major question is whether there will be enough people to fill the available jobs that require a college degree. </p>\n\n<p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states-2021\">foreign-born people</a> made up 16% of registered nurses in the U.S., though that percentage is higher in certain states, like California.

Indeed, the percentage of young people enrolled as <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-enrollment-decline/\">college undergraduates fell</a> almost 15% from 2010 through 2022. </p>\n\n<p>For one, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities\">tuition and fees at private colleges</a> have increased about 32% since 2006, after adjusting for inflation. And in-state tuition and fees at public universities have also grown about 29% since 2006. </p>\n\n<p>The total of <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/average-student-loan-debt/\">federal student loan debt</a> for <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics%22%22\">college has</a> also tripled since 2007. It stood at about <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">$1.84 trillion</a> in 2024. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that in order to ensure enough college-educated people can fill the anticipated work openings in the future, universities and the government should embrace needed changes to increase both enrollment and completion rates. </p>\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence will transform work worldwide, for example, and that shift should be incorporated into higher education curriculum and degrees. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kids-need-soft-skills-in-the-age-of-ai-but-what-does-this-mean-for-schools-261518\">Soft skills</a> – like problem-solving, collaboration, presentation and writing skills – will become more important and should be prioritized in the learning process.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that universities should also prioritize experiential education, including paid internships that offer students academic credit. This can help students gain experience that is both accredited and is connected to direct career pathways. </p>\n\n<p>Universities and high schools could also expand how much they offer <a href=\"https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/news/what-is-a-microcredential/\">microcredentials</a> – or short, focused learning programs that offer practical skills in a specific area – so students can connect their education with clear career pathways. </p>\n\n<p>These reforms aren’t easy. They require a commitment to change, and all of this work will require deep partnerships with the government. While that might be a heavy lift currently at the federal level, it is both possible and achievable to make advances on these and other changes at the state level. </p>\n\n<p>American universities and colleges have always been key to preparing the workforce for economic opportunity. At the end of World War II, for example, <a href=\"https://columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Columbia University and IBM</a> worked together to help create the academic discipline now called computer science. </p>\n\n<p>This action did more than help one university or one employer. It fueled change across higher education and across private companies and the government, leading to massive economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Universities have made countless other contributions to strengthen and expand the economy. Considering solutions to some of the challenges that stop students from going to college could help ensure that more students see the value in a college education – and a tangible way for them to connect it to a future career.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267612/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Stanley S.

And his <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250916a.htm\">recently handpicked governor</a>, Stephen Miran, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/feds-miran-wants-aggressive-rate-cuts-downplays-differences-with-other-officials-2025-10-03/\">has led the charge</a> in pushing for a bigger cut than preferred by his new colleagues at the Fed.</p>\n\n<p>When an economy is strong, <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Monetary-Policy\">central banks typically don’t cut interest rates</a> and may even raise them to avoid spurring inflation. And so to support his argument for large cuts, Miran <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/fed-s-waller-calls-for-careful-rate-cuts-to-support-labor-market?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=Hjm5biAW\">has played up “downside risks”</a> to the economy and a weakening labor market, contrasting with Trump’s talk of a “golden age.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump and Miran also seem to be ignoring the problem of inflation, which the president has said “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-trumps-recent-claims-about-the-economy/\">has been defeated</a>” and Miran considers close enough to the Fed’s target of 2%. Yet, inflation <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2025/20251007\">remains high and has been picking back up</a> in recent months – one of the core reasons the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20250917.htm\">Fed has taken a gradual approach</a> to lowering interest rates. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/about/our-leaders-and-scholars/faculty-and-academic-divisions/faculty-profiles/joshua-stillwagon.php\">I’m a macroeconomist</a>, which means I study big-picture factors affecting an economy, such as interest rates. </p>\n\n<p>It’s well known that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/how-interest-rates-affect-markets.asp\">lower rates spur faster growth</a>, and of course all presidents want a stronger economy on their watch. But the Fed’s job when it sets interest rates is to deal with whatever reality the data shows – and make decisions accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2>Is the economy hot or not?</h2>\n\n<p>In the simplest terms, the Fed raises interest rates when the economy is “hot,” or inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, and lowers them when there are concerns about unemployment.</p>\n\n<p>At its most recent meeting, in September, the Fed lowered rates a quarter of a point, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">citing slowing jobs growth</a>, and increased economic uncertainty. Trump nominee Miran was the only one of the 12 members of the Fed’s policy-setting committee to instead <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20250917.htm\">vote for a more aggressive half-point cut</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The only credible rationale for that large of an interest rate cut, in the face of still-high inflation, is by believing the labor market is incredibly weak. According to the Fed’s preferred measure, the <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/personal-income-and-outlays-august-2025\">personal consumption expenditures index</a>, inflation has been accelerating all summer and was 2.7% at the end of August, well above the Fed’s 2% target. </p>\n\n<p>There’s no doubt jobs growth <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html?msockid=39cb2ef1649f60cb15f33ba165106160\">has slowed considerably</a> in recent months, but enough to completely ignore the risk of driving inflation higher? At this point at least, the Fed doesn’t think so.</p>\n\n<p>And if the economy were in fact running hot, as the president claims, the Fed would have little choice but to keep rates flat or raise them, especially given elevated inflation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a man in a suit speaks in front of a microphone with a few people sitting in the background\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698402/original/file-20251024-56-eskac8.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Stephen Miran, who was recently nominated to the Federal Open Market Committee, has been pushing for much larger rate cuts than his colleagues.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/SenateFederalReserve/2894c5957bc2451a9ba5ba4f4d0c1f7a/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Risks of following political whims</h2>\n\n<p>This situation gets at the heart of why central bank independence matters.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s efforts to influence the Federal Reserve have not been subtle and break with Congress’ intention to <a href=\"https://www.kansascityfed.org/about-us/accountability-and-governance-of-the-federal-reserve/\">insulate the Fed from political manipulation</a>. Besides pressing for big rate cuts, he has tried to <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/09/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-for-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook/\">fire a member of the Board of Governors</a> over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-bank-documents-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna230964\">questionable allegations</a> and mused about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/politics/trump-powell-firing-letter.html\">removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The risks of following the wishes of a president in the face of what the data shows were starkly demonstrated in 2021, when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/10/14/turkey-erdogan-central-bank-firing-clears-way-for-more-rate-cuts\">fired the head of the country’s central bank</a>. The central banker was pushing rates higher to tame inflation, which <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGTUR\">was at about 20%</a>, but Erdogan demanded they be lowered. In response, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/turkish-lira-plunges-to-fresh-low-ahead-of-anticipated-interest-rate-cut.html\">Turkey’s lira plunged to record lows</a> and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGTUR\">inflation soared</a> to over 70% in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Something similar could happen in the U.S. if Trump continues down the same path of meddling with the Fed. As a sign of how much Wall Street worries about this risk, a <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5436816\">recent study estimated</a> that if Trump followed through on his threat to fire Powell, the stock market could lose an estimated US$1 trillion as a result. </p>\n\n<p>That’s because the Fed’s credibility rests on its ability to make decisions driven by economic evidence, not political expedience. That independence means policymakers must weigh data on inflation, jobs and growth rather than election cycles or partisan demands. </p>\n\n<h2>Justifying deeper rate cuts</h2>\n\n<p>Looking ahead to the Fed’s next meeting Oct. 28-29, policymakers face a delicate balancing act. With inflation still running above target and signs of slowing jobs growth, it needs to lower rates enough to prevent a downturn but not so low that inflation spirals out of control. </p>\n\n<p>Traders are putting <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">near-100% odds of two more quarter-point cuts</a> this year, one on Oct. 29 and another in December. This would bring the Fed’s benchmark interest rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75% by the end of 2025, down from 4%-4.25% now.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Miran’s own interest rate projections, he’s likely to again push for a larger cut of a half-point or more at both meetings, as he believes the Fed’s benchmark rate <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mirans-fed-dissent-makes-splash-fails-sway-outcome-2025-09-17/\">should be below 3%</a> by the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>To me, as an economist, the only way a Fed acting independently could reasonably justify such a significant cut in rates in the next few months is if the unemployment rate begins rising steadily, with the economy clearly at risk of slipping into a recession.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266969/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joshua Stillwagon was a long-time organizer and judge for an academic competition hosted at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and has presented research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. </span></em></p>",

A 2023 survey of 26 countries revealed that about <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/two-global-religious-divides-geographic-and-generational\">half the respondents</a> believed in the existence of angels, demons, fairies and ghosts. In the United States, a 2020 poll found that about <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/32807-ghosts-demons-exist-poll-data\">half of Americans believe</a> ghosts and demons are real.</p>\n\n<p>While the subject of demons and ghosts can inspire dread, the concepts themselves can be confusing: Is there a difference between the two?</p>\n\n<p>Historically, communities have understood the supernatural according to their religious and spiritual traditions.

As a <a href=\"https://penelopegeng.com/\">scholar of early modern English literature</a>, my research focuses on how everyday people in 16th- and 17th-century Europe used storytelling to navigate major social changes. This era, often called <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/renaissance\">the Renaissance</a>, was punctuated by the establishment of mass media through printing, the global spread of colonization and the emergence of modern science and medicine.</p>\n\n<p>Digging into the literary archive can reveal people’s ideas about demons and ghosts – and what made them different.</p>\n\n<h2>Martin Luther and the Reformation</h2>\n\n<p>On Oct. 31, 1517, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-lasting-impact-of-luthers-reformation-4-essential-reads-105953\">Martin Luther</a>, an ex-law student and former monk, boldly published his <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2021667736/\">Ninety-Five Theses</a>. In it, he rejected the Catholic Church’s promise that monetary payment to the church could reduce the amount of time one’s soul <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/purgatory-Roman-Catholicism\">spent in purgatory</a>. What began as a local protest in Wittenberg, Germany, soon swept all the major European powers into a life and death struggle over religious reform. Towns were besieged, landscapes scorched, villages pillaged.</p>\n\n<p>This period, called <a href=\"https://www.nls.uk/collections/stories/scottish-history/how-martin-luther-sparked-the-reformation/\">the Reformation</a>, led to the establishment of new Christian denominations. Among these Protestant churches’ early teachings was the edict that purgatory did not exist and <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/articles-religion#XXII\">souls could not return to Earth</a> to haunt the living. Protestant reformers insisted that after death, one’s soul was immediately judged. The virtuous flew up to God in heaven; the sinful burned in hell with the Devil. </p>\n\n<p>According to Protestants, ghosts were invented by Catholic priests to scare people into obedience. For example, the English translator of Ludwig Lavater’s 1572 book “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ofghostesspirite00lava/page/n3/mode/2up\">Of Ghostes and Spirites Walking by Night</a>” insists ghosts are the “falsehood of Monkes, or illusions of devils, franticke imaginations, or some other frivolous and vaine perswasions.” Should you ever encounter an “apparition,” you must call it out for what it truly is: a devil pretending to be a ghost.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Page of a book reading 'The Tragic History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus' with an image of a man holding a book standing in a circle of runes summoning a demon\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=872&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=872&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=872&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1096&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1096&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694416/original/file-20251003-56-f3o3d.gif?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1096&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Title page of Christopher Marlowe’s ‘Doctor Faustus.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Faustus-tragedy.gif\">Iohn Wright/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Christopher Marlowe’s play “Doctor Faustus” comments on these debates. Written in the 1580s for a primarily Protestant audience, the play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKDbwXQ-Rkk\">features a scene</a> in which Dr. Faustus and his devil companion, Mephistopheles, trick the pope by snatching away his meal. A bewildered member of the papal court concludes “it may be some ghost … come to beg a pardon of your Holiness.” The audience knows full well, however, that these pranks are committed by the necromancer and his demon.</p>\n\n<h2>Ghostly haunting</h2>\n\n<p>In spite of Protestantism’s official stance against ghosts, belief in them persisted in the <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Living-Death-in-Early-Modern-Drama/Alsop/p/book/9781032071688\">popular imagination</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Archival records show that ordinary people held fast to popular beliefs despite what their religious authorities decreed. For example, the <a href=\"https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/reading-the-casebooks/who-were-the-practitioners/richard-napier\">casebook of Richard Napier</a>, an astrological physician, <a href=\"https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/cases/CASE47218?show=normalised%5d\">reports several cases</a> <a href=\"https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/cases/CASE38123\">of “spirit” hauntings</a>, including that of a young mother named <a href=\"https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/cases/CASE12907\">Catherine Wells</a> who had been “vexed … with a spirit” for three continuous years.</p>\n\n<p>Popular plays provide additional evidence. Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” opens with a midnight visitation by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g05x9X7mpcY\">ghost of Hamlet’s father</a>, telling his son he cannot rest in peace until his murderer is brought to justice. Ghostly victims seeking justice appear in other Shakespearean plays, including “Macbeth” and “Richard III.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/ax/universitypress/subjects/history/british-history-after-1450/cheap-print-and-popular-piety-15501640\">Cheap print</a>, a form of common media, capitalized on the public’s interest in the paranormal. Part entertainment, part journalism, cheap print was read by all sorts of people. A 1662 pamphlet titled “<a href=\"http://name.umdl.umich.edu/A61754.0001.001\">A strange and wonderfull discovery of a horrid and cruel murther [murder]</a>” describes Isabel Binnington’s unsettling encounter with the ghost of Robert Eliot. In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/658242\">her testimonial</a>, she claims that Eliot’s ghost promised he would never hurt her. What he wanted was simply for her to hear his story: He had been murdered for his coins in the very house she occupied.</p>\n\n<p>A 1730 broadside ballad called “<a href=\"https://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/31051/album#\">The Suffolk Miracle</a>” – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8fk6UpnS1c\">still performed today</a> – tells the tale of young lovers parted by an overprotective father. After the daughter is whisked away, her beloved dies of a broken heart. When his ghost later appears to her, she “joy’d to see her heart’s delight.”</p>\n\n<h2>Demonic possession</h2>\n\n<p>While reformed Protestant thinkers rejected the existence of ghosts, they enthusiastically accepted the reality of devils. </p>\n\n<p>Reports of demonic possession were popular. Before his ascension to the English throne, King James VI of Scotland published a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_daemonologie-in-forme-o_james-i_1597/mode/2up\">literary treatise on demonology</a> in 1597. He argues that “assaultes of Sathan are most certainly practized” and “detestable slaves of the Devill” live among us.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Engraving of a man surrounded by devilish creatures tearing at and beating him\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=788&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=788&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=788&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=990&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=990&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694419/original/file-20251003-56-mk43w1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=990&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">‘Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons,’ 1470–74.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336142\">Martin Schongauer/Rogers Fund via The Met</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The diaries of English Puritans offer further proof that beliefs about devilish encounters were common. In the 1650s, the Calvinist preacher Thomas Hall insisted that his godliness <a href=\"https://worcestershirehistoricalsociety.co.uk/product/the-autobiography-and-library-of-thomas-hall-b-d-1610-1665/\">attracted the attention of Satan</a> like a moth to a candle. From an early age, he complained, he was subjected to “Satanicall buffettings” and terrifying dreams. He believed, however, that surviving demonic temptation demonstrated his unwavering devotion to God.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinguishing ghosts from demons</h2>\n\n<p>Based on the literature, what can we conclude about how people saw ghosts and demons?</p>\n\n<p>Early modern people often represented ghosts as sad and pitiable. They were depicted as the spiritual remainder of a recently deceased person, haunting their friends and kin – or, occasionally, a stranger. They retained some of their humanity and were psychically connected to a place, such as their former home, or to a person, such as their most cherished companion.</p>\n\n<p>Demons, by contrast, were almost always malevolent tricksters who served the Devil. Demons lacked knowledge of what it meant to be human. Hell was the demons’ lair. Early modern texts describe them visiting the earthly plane to corrupt, possess or tempt humans to commit self-harm or violence against others.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIIqxnmQ_es?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Faustus getting dragged to hell at the Globe Theatre.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Then and now, stories of ghosts and demons have provoked fear and wonder. Tales of the supernatural have inspired the imagination of kings, theologians, playwrights and everyday people.</p>\n\n<p>Approaching the topic of the otherworldly with intellectual humility can inspire deeper curiosity about cultures across space and time. As Hamlet muses to his friend after meeting the ghost of his father, “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

They vary in size and texture too: Some are smooth, others warty. They can even be miniature or giant. </p>\n\n<p>The word “pumpkin” comes from the <a href=\"https://www.rhododendron.org/blog/?view=plink&amp;id=149\">Greek word “peopon</a>,” meaning “large melon.” Botanically, pumpkins are fruits because they contain seeds, and they belong to the squash family, Cucurbitaceae. <a href=\"https://ipm.missouri.edu/meg/2013/10/Pumpkin-A-Brief-History/\">This family also includes</a> cucumbers, zucchini and gourds.

In 2023, Illinois grew <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/newsroom/trending-topics/pumpkins-background-statistics\">15,400 acres of pumpkins</a>. The next largest amount was grown in Indiana, with about 6,500 acres. </p>\n\n<p>Pumpkin yields vary each year, depending on the varieties grown and the growing conditions in each area. The <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/newsroom/trending-topics/pumpkins-background-statistics\">top six pumpkin-producing states</a> are California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>\n\n<h2>Early pumpkin history</h2>\n\n<p>Pumpkins originated in Central and South America, ending up in North America as Native Americans migrated north and carried the seeds with them. The oldest pumpkin seeds discovered were found in Mexico and <a href=\"https://ucanr.edu/blog/under-solano-sun/article/pumpkinsthe-more-you-know\">date back about 9,000 years</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Pumpkins were grown as a crop <a href=\"https://ipm.missouri.edu/meg/2013/10/Pumpkin-A-Brief-History/\">even before corn or beans</a>, the other two sisters in a traditional Native American “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/returning-the-three-sisters-corn-beans-and-squash-to-native-american-farms-nourishes-people-land-and-cultures-149230\">three sisters” garden</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tont/learn/nature/the-three-sisters.htm\">three sister crops</a> – corn, beans and squash – are planted together, and each has a role in helping the others grow. </p>\n\n<p>Native Americans planted corn in the spring, and once the plants were a few inches tall, they planted beans. The beans vine around the corn as it grows, giving them a natural trellis. Beans also have the ability to take nitrogen from the atmosphere, and with the help of bacteria they <a href=\"https://pubs.nmsu.edu/_a/A129/\">convert it into forms that plants can use</a>, such as ammonia, for fertilizer.  </p>\n\n<p>After the beans started growing, it was time to plant squash, such as pumpkin. Squash leaves covered the ground, shading the soil and helping keep it moist. The giant leaves also helped reduce the number of weeds that would compete with the corn, bean and squash growth.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://food.unl.edu/free-resources/newsletters/food-fun-young-children/try-each-part-pumpkin-new-way/\">Every part of the pumpkin plant</a> is edible, even the flowers. Some Native American groups would dry pumpkins’ tough outer shells, cut them into strips and <a href=\"https://exarc.net/issue-2024-4/ea/experimental-recreation-pumpkin-leather-mat\">weave them into mats</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Pumpkins were introduced to Europe from North America through the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Columbian-exchange\">Columbian Exchange</a>. Europeans found that the pumpkins grown in the New World were <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2017/11/a-brief-history-of-pumpkin-pie-in-america/\">easier to grow and sweeter</a> than the ones in 1600s England or France, likely due to the weather and soil conditions in the Americas. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white illustration of a group of people loading pumpkins in a cart.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=395&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698229/original/file-20251023-56-69madb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=497&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">People have been harvesting pumpkin for centuries.

Others followed English traditions, combining pumpkin and apple with sugar and spices between two crusts. </p>\n\n<p>The custard-style pumpkin pie we know today first appeared in 1796 as part of the first cookbook written and published in the United States, “<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/96126967/\">American Cookery,” by Amelia Simmons</a>. There were actually two pumpkin pie recipes: one used mace, nutmeg and ginger, the other just allspice and ginger. </p>\n\n<h2>The pumpkin spice craze</h2>\n\n<p>Pumpkin spice as one mixed ingredient was sold beginning in the early 1930s for convenience. <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/pumpkin-spice-history\">The spice mix typically includes</a> a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and cloves. </p>\n\n<p>Pumpkins and pumpkin spice are now synonymous with fall in America. Pumpkin spice flavoring <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/pumpkin-spice-food-ranking-2025/\">is used in</a> candles, marshmallows, coffees, lotions, yogurts, pretzels, cookies, milk and many other products.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A white mug with a Starbucks logo, filled with foamy coffee and powdered cinnamon on top.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698406/original/file-20251024-56-yu7b3w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte kicked off the craze thath put this seasonal flavor in high demand.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/pumpkin-spice-latte-served-in-strabucks-coffee-in-krakow-news-photo/2180226743?adppopup=true\">Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While pumpkin spice is available in one form or another all year long, sales of pumpkin-spiced products <a href=\"https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/pumpkins\">increase exponentially in the fall</a>. The pumpkin spice craze is so popular that <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/news/article/pumpkin-spice-latte-2025-when-start-fall-menu-20823836.php\">the start of the pumpkin spice season</a> is a couple of months before the pumpkins themselves are even <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/newsroom/trending-topics/pumpkins-background-statistics\">ready to harvest in October</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Pumpkin excursions</h2>\n\n<p>Americans continue to wholeheartedly embrace pumpkins today. Pumpkins in production <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/print-publications/hla/squash-and-pumpkin-production-hla-6026.pdf\">are typically hand-harvested</a> as soon as they mature, when the skins are hard enough to not be dented when you press it with your thumb. </p>\n\n<p>Children often take field trips to pumpkin patches <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.34068/joe.61.01.12\">to pick their own</a>. With the growing <a href=\"https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/local-foods-and-communities/agritourism\">popularity of agritourism</a>, many farmers are letting the customers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18666/JPRA-2020-10038\">go into the field and pick their own</a>, getting more dollars per pumpkin than farmers could get by selling through the markets. Customer harvesting also reduces labor costs, produces immediate profits and builds community relationships. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, farmers often combine the you-pick experience <a href=\"https://ucanr.edu/program/uc-anr-small-farms-network/pumpkins-small-scale-agriculture-alternative\">with other sources of income</a>: corn mazes, hay rides, petting zoos and more. The customers get fresher fruit, enjoy a fun and educational activity and support the local economy.  </p>\n\n<p>This year you could get pumpkin spice flavors across the United States by late August, and the <a href=\"https://billpetro.com/history-of-october/\">industry started promoting pumpkin spice season in July</a>. Because fall has the right conditions for pumpkin picking, the season will keep its hold on pumpkin spice flavor, and consumers will continue to eagerly await its return each year.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268260/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shelley Mitchell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And that field experience had to be real, a place I wanted to be – somewhere where we had a shot at discovery.</p>\n\n<p>I chose outcrops of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Formation\">Lance Formation</a>, a rock formation composed largely of sandstones laid down during last few million years of the dinosaur era. These rocks are well exposed in the parched badlands of Wyoming, crisscrossed for more than a century by dinosaur hunters. Yet, perhaps they missed something. </p>\n\n<p>Then I saw it. </p>\n\n<p>At the top of the hill lay a massive concretion – a hardened, iron-stained rock the size of a compact car – surrounded by some fossil bone fragments. Poking from its side were a series of small rod-shaped bones I recognized as the stomach ribs of the giant predator <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/facts/tyrannosaurus-rex\">Tyrannosaurus rex</a>.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Mummies nearby</h2>\n\n<p>But <em>T. rex</em> wasn’t alone among the amazing finds that field season. That same field trip, colleagues working nearby uncovered two fossilized duckbills – a plant-eating dinosaur that roamed in herds and grew to the length of <em>T. rex.</em> They <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3536\">showed signs of extraordinary preservation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Poking out of the vertical wall of a cutbank in a seasonally dry river was a vertebra – part of the backbone – and some ossified tendons.</p>\n\n<p>“What do you think?” <a href=\"https://usasciencefestival.org/people/marcus-eriksen/\">asked my colleague Marcus Eriksen</a>, who counts paleoartistry, science education and environmentalism as his other mainstays alongside paleontology. “You’ve got the back half of a duckbill,” I said, referring to <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmontosaurus_annectens\">Edmontosaurus annectens</a></em>, the formal name for the dinosaur most likely to be on <em>T. rex</em>’s dinner menu.</p>\n\n<p>It would take Marcus two field seasons to remove 15 feet of rock overlying the skeleton. To his surprise, the tail bones were covered with large areas of scaly skin and topped by a row of spikes. When I visited the exposed skeleton and took a look at its feet, I saw a hairline around the final toe bone. “Pull back, take more,” I said, wide-eyed at what I saw. “I think it has the hooves.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A rock showing the outline of several bones and a hoof.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=464&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697342/original/file-20251020-56-ga7f4d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=583&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A juvenile duckbill dinosaur’s hoof preserved as a thin layer of clay.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1097072\">Tyler Keillor/Fossil Lab</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Yet another group of bone hunters in the area found a <em>Triceratops</em> skeleton next to a large slab of its scaly skin.

I recruited <a href=\"https://evansaitta.blog/\">Evan Saitta</a> to rigorously determine the composition of the ancient scaly skin, after learning he was cooking reptile skin to mimic fossilization.</p>\n\n<p>I brought others on board: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/doritodon/?hl=en\">Dan Vidal</a>, a Spanish paleontologist able to digitally capture surface detail in 3D; <a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/2012/08/17/nathan-myhrvold/\">Nathan Myhrvold</a>, a polyglot scientist fresh off studying the chemistry of barbecue; <a href=\"https://www.stephaniebaumgart.com/\">Stephanie Baumgart</a>, a paleontologist steeped in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/30/getting-under-a-fossils-skin-how-ct-scans-have-changed-palaeontology-dinosaur-lizard\">CT scans</a> of living vertebrates; María Ciudad Real and Lauren Bop, the first skilled at analyzing CT scans and the latter at combining them into composite figures; <a href=\"https://www.tylerkeillor.com/\">Tyler Keillor</a>, who would invent new methods to clean ancient skin tissue; and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/playerdng/?hl=en\">Dani Navarro</a>, a superb Spanish paleoartist who reimagines prehistoric scenes.</p>\n\n<h2>Clay mask, crests, hooves and scales</h2>\n\n<p>We used a diamond blade to section the skin, spikes and hooves, and found that all were made of a very thin bounding layer of clay – a clay mask or template – one-hundredth of an inch (less than 1 millimeter) thick. The sand on both sides of the clay layer was indistinguishable, suggesting that when the carcass was buried, the same sand that pressed against the outside also entered the dried, hollowed carcass through many cracks and holes, filling all of the internal spaces. Even the spaces inside the spikes and hooves were sand-filled. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3536\">We found no evidence</a> of tissue structures inside the clay layer, whether looking at scaly skin, a spike or a hoof. And we could not find any trace of original organic materials. In other words, the original skin inside the clay layer must have decayed and washed away, while the same groundwater saturated the bones en route to their fossilization.</p>\n\n<p>The very real-looking skin, spikes and hooves of our duckbill are actually a mask of clay, a thin layer applied to the outside that captured all of the original form and texture of the fleshy body surface.</p>\n\n<p>To test out the digital rendering we’d created, we compared the digital version of the duckbill’s hoofed foot with a fossilized duckbill footprint on a museum shelf in Canada, discovered in beds of the same age as those of the Lance Formation. We adjusted our foot up slightly in size, to see it was a snug fit. Together, the foot and footprint generated the first complete view of a duckbill’s fleshy foot.</p>\n\n<p>The only duckbill alive at this time was <em>Edmontosaurus annectens</em>, the likely track-maker. The footprint was preserved so perfectly that it showed the scales on the sole of the foot. </p>\n\n<h2>The ‘mummy’ zone</h2>\n\n<p>The Lance Formation’s unique geology allowed many of these dinosaur mummies to be preserved under clay, in a small area.</p>\n\n<p>Drilling in pursuit of natural gas and oil in Wyoming has shown that the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lance-Formation\">sandstone rock composing the Lance Formation</a> is very deep beneath the mummies, measuring more than 1,000 meters (over 3,200 feet). This is five times thicker than anywhere else in the West, suggesting that the formation subsided more quickly in the mummy zone, with periodic floods covering up dried dinosaur carcasses. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DQKXaq6jpNM&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>In this <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-cretaceous-period.html\">last epoch of the dinosur era</a> in western North America, a <a href=\"https://skybrary.aero/articles/tropical-monsoon-climate-am\">monsoonal climate</a> took hold. Severe droughts brought death to vast herds of duck-billed dinosaurs – for some, right as they looked for the last bit of water in a dry riverbed before succumbing. Flash floods followed, bringing tons of sandy sediment that would cover a sun-dried dinosaur carcass in an instant. </p>\n\n<p>Only rarely do scientists have the chance to accurately visualize what any large dinosaur looked like when alive, because all we normally have are bones to reconstruct beasts with no close living analog. Dinosaur “mummies” give us that extraordinary opportunity through a fluke of preservation.</p>\n\n<p>The dream research team I assembled was able to clean, scan, resize, combine and otherwise restore the life appearance of a duck-billed dinosaur from rare dinosaur mummies – breathing life back into the fossils, and allowing all to appreciate the grandeur of past life.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267619/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Paul C.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Sixty-three years ago, President John F. Kennedy single-handedly brought the world back from the brink of nuclear war by staring down Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev over the Cuban missile crisis. At least, so goes a standard U.S.-centric interpretation of events.</p>\n\n<p>But despite the narrative of presidential strength and American resolve saving the day, the truth is more complicated – and involved a wider cast of continental characters.</p>\n\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.unr.edu/history/faculty-staff/renata-keller\">expert in Latin American and Cold War history</a> with a <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">new book on the topic</a>, I argue that when it comes to the Cuban missile crisis, it took a proverbial regional village to avert catastrophe. Indeed, the United States did not solve or experience the drama alone. Much as in geopolitics today, the Cuban missile crisis took place in a complicated environment where the entire hemisphere both reckoned with and helped shape the realities of American power and regional dominance.</p>\n\n<h2>Regional assistance during the crisis</h2>\n\n<p>On the evening of Oct. 22, 1962, Kennedy took to the airwaves and revealed to a live international audience that the Soviet Union had secretly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/cuban-missile-crisis-60-years-on-new-papers-reveal-how-close-the-world-came-to-nuclear-disaster\">placed nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba</a> capable of reaching most of the mainland U.S. and Latin America.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u07rkwHTPLk?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In a nationwide address, President John F. Kennedy publicly reveals details about Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Throughout his speech, Kennedy consistently emphasized that the missiles threatened the security not just of the U.S. but of the entire hemisphere. And because the missiles were a regional threat, they required a regional solution. Kennedy called upon the Organization of American States, a regional body created in 1948 to coordinate hemispheric affairs, including security, to invoke the <a href=\"https://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/b-29.html\">1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance</a> “in support of all necessary action” to remove the missiles.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. regional neighbors responded immediately to Kennedy’s call for action.</p>\n\n<p>During the crisis, Mexico and Brazil were the two Latin American countries that <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26925359\">most enthusiastically supported</a> a peaceful resolution. The leaders of both countries were moderate leftists and had <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mexicos-cold-war/B1D4C291D1C928A53B00BEE68F59E6AF\">demonstrated sympathy</a> with the Cuban Revolution before the missile crisis. Mexico and Brazil were two of the few remaining nations in the Americas that still had official ties with Cuba and, as a result, their leaders could help facilitate shuttle diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>Mexico’s president, Adolfo López Mateos, sent a <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">personal message</a> to Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós as soon as he learned about the missiles. López Mateos made a special appeal “in the name of the friendly relations that unite and have united our countries.” He stated that he believed it was his duty to “cordially call upon your government so that those bases are not used in any form whatsoever and the offensive weapons are withdrawn from Cuban territory.” By communicating directly with the Cubans, Mexico’s president treated them as full participants in the crisis on their island, not as mere victims, puppets or observers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A man appears on an old TV broadcast\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=518&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=518&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697627/original/file-20251021-56-lejguz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=518&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">On Oct. 23, 1962, Cuban leader Fidel Castro replies to the U.S. decision to quarantine the island.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/CASTROCUBANMISSILERESPONSE/55cecb9ffae6da11af9f0014c2589dfb/photo\">AP Photo</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Mexico’s government also helped <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">maintain surveillance</a> in the waters around Cuba and clamped down on any pro-Cuban protests during the missile crisis. Mexico’s navy sent 10 ships to patrol the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. The U.S. ambassador noted the lack of violent demonstrations in Mexico and attributed the peaceful public response to the “<a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">firm control maintained by national and local police and military forces</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Like López Mateos, Brazilian President João Goulart tried to use his country’s special relationship with Cuba to convince the Cubans to make concessions during the crisis. Goulart <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26925359\">secretly reached out</a> to Cuban leaders through his ambassador in Havana, the Cuban ambassador in Rio de Janeiro and Cuba’s representative to the United Nations. Through these channels, he tried to convince the Cubans to open their territory to an investigative U.N. commission.</p>\n\n<p>Goulart also sent a special envoy to Havana who pleaded for a peaceful resolution. This mission was actually a <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">top secret favor to the Americans</a>, who had asked the Brazilians to use their special relationship with Cuba to serve as mediators and suggest to Cuban leader Fidel Castro that giving up the nuclear weapons could be the first step in improving Cuba’s relations with its neighbors. “From such actions many changes in the relations between Cuba and the OAS countries, including the U.S., could flow,” the message promised. </p>\n\n<h2>Crafty diplomacy</h2>\n\n<p>Most importantly, Mexican and Brazilian leaders changed their position in international organizations in response to the Cuban missile crisis. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to the crisis, these two countries had resisted all multilateral actions against Cuba and had abstained from Organization of American States votes that put sanctions on the island. But on Oct. 23, 1962, they changed their position and joined the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v10-12mSupp/d390\">unanimous vote</a> to establish a quarantine around Cuba. The quarantine laid out a large zone where ships approaching the island could be intercepted and searched for offensive military equipment. </p>\n\n<p>The OAS action provided the <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/the-cuban-missile-crisis/\">legal foundations for the quarantine</a>. Establishing the quarantine under the auspices of articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty made it a multilateral “<a href=\"https://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/b-29.html\">act of common defense</a>.” Had the U.S. acted alone, interdicting ships in international waters would have legally been considered a “<a href=\"https://knowledge.lancashire.ac.uk/id/eprint/22487/1/US%20Legal%20Case%20CMC.docx.pdf\">blockade</a>,” or act of war. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Men in suits gather at the White House.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=394&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698075/original/file-20251023-56-8hv32m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President John F.

Latin American leaders were protecting their own countries, not just the U.S., when they demanded the removal of the Soviet missiles. The unanimous vote also helped the U.S. demonstrate to the rest of the world that other countries in the Americas agreed that the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba posed an unacceptable threat.</p>\n\n<p>Another Latin American country, Venezuela, not only joined the unanimous vote to establish the quarantine but also <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">participated</a> in it. Venezuela contributed airplanes, two destroyers and the country’s only submarine to the Inter-American Quarantine Force, a combined group of Latin American armed forces that constituted the southernmost part of the quarantine line. The Cuban missile crisis marked the first time in modern Venezuelan history that the country’s forces had participated in international military actions.</p>\n\n<p>“My government will comply with each and every one of its international compromises,” <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469689432/the-fate-of-the-americas/\">declared Venezuela’s President Rómulo Betancourt</a>, “not only out of loyalty to written agreements in treaties that impose inevitable obligations, but also out of a sense of national survival.”</p>\n\n<h2>Inevitable obligations and national survival</h2>\n\n<p>The Venezuelan president’s declaration about his country’s response to the crisis reminds Washington what it may be forsaking and risking with today’s current policy toward Latin America. </p>\n\n<p>During the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy and Latin American leaders took their international obligations seriously and used international law to their advantage instead of defying it. In comparison, recent months have seen the Trump administration flout international norms by carrying out unilateral <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/how-many-us-strikes-boats-near-venezuela-have-there-been-2025-10-17/\">strikes on ships in Caribbean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-strikes-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-10-22/\">Pacific waters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy resisted the temptation to use preemptive airstrikes during the Cuban missile crisis because it would have violated international norms and <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/msc_cuba031.asp\">undermined the U.S. reputation</a> at home and abroad. In avoiding extrajudicial violence and finding a peaceful, multilateral solution, Kennedy and his Latin American partners strengthened the rule of law and defended their national and international security.</p>\n\n<p>During the crisis, the U.S.’s neighbors in Latin America helped Kennedy take a step back from the brink and find a peaceful solution. That the world avoided nuclear war in 1962 was a triumph of multilateralism, rather than U.S. unilateralism.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265841/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Renata Keller received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Philosophical Society. </span></em></p>",

One way these organizations are responding is by trying to save money on their staffing by <a href=\"https://www.nonprofithr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ContingentWorkforce.pdf\">hiring contractors, consultants and temporary staff</a> instead of full-time employees.</p>\n\n<p>But those flexible labor arrangements can have drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c2QxxsAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">two nonprofit management</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bh66OjkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra\">scholars</a>. We analyzed data collected from 2008-2018 that was drawn from 7,838 museums, theaters, community arts centers and other arts and cultural nonprofits across the country. As explained in studies published in two peer-reviewed journals around the same time, we identified a gap between the promise of flexible labor arrangements and their actual outcomes for arts and culture nonprofits. </p>\n\n<p>First, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14719037.2025.2526533\">assessed the nonprofits’ operational performance</a> using in-person attendance at theatrical performances, museum exhibits and other live events as a proxy for how well these nonprofits were delivering services and reaching their target audiences.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the studies, published in July 2025 in the journal Public Management Review, we found that attendance for the groups that relied entirely on flexible labor was about 27% lower compared to those that relied instead on permanent, full-time employees. The attendance problem was more pronounced when nonprofits used contractors and other such arrangements for their core activities, including program delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Operational performance was less affected when nonprofits used contractors only for administrative roles, such as IT or fundraising. In those cases, attendance was about the same as when the nonprofits employed permanent staff members for those jobs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A big crowd gathers to hear musicians perform.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697884/original/file-20251022-64-5q9t8s.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A crowd gathers at the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Go-Go Museum &amp; Cafe in Washington, D.C.’s Anacostia district on Nov. 18, 2024.

It’s more of a Band-Aid than a cure.</p>\n\n<p>We suspect that many nonprofits need employees with long-term commitments to their causes, communities and partners to succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Flexible labor models are common in the private sector, where efficiency and cost-cutting are key performance metrics. Nonprofits, by contrast, generate value through trust, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/02750740211050363\">continuity and deep community relationships</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It takes time to build the necessary institutional knowledge and commitment required of strong nonprofit staff members.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary staff members may not stick around long enough to build relationships or understand, let alone share, a nonprofit’s mission. When the person leading a youth program or managing community outreach is here today and gone tomorrow, that program’s quality will probably suffer.</p>\n\n<p>The trust between a nonprofit and the people who benefit from it gets built through repeated, positive interactions. Because that trust can erode quickly, relying on flexible labor can be less useful for nonprofits than for-profit employers. </p>\n\n<p>For most nonprofits, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/nml.21352\">personnel costs are</a> typically the largest part of a nonprofit’s budget, making them tempting to cut. But <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4OG5TUwA6cI\">replacing permanent employees with contractors</a> to save money risks cutting into the muscle of the organization, not just the fat.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>We focused on arts and cultural nonprofits, which make up a majority of all arts groups. Almost 9 in 10 museums and visual arts institutions, 3 in 4 dance companies and about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9781503611085-026\">6 in 10 theaters are nonprofits</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The advantages and disadvantages of using flexible labor arrangements may differ for other kinds of nonprofits, such as those engaged in health care or providing social services.</p>\n\n<p>There could be other variables. Contractors who freely choose to not be a full-time, permanent employee – and are already familiar with the organization’s work and mission – may do their job much better than people with little relevant experience.</p>\n\n<p>And because of data limitations, we grouped all flexible labor into a single category. Hiring independent contractors, on-call workers and temporary staff via contracting firms may have different effects on an organization’s performance.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266560/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

They work the same waterfront as journalism and public relations, but their relationship with those mainstay practices built around fact and advocacy is an uneasy one. </p>\n\n<p>And when it comes to the rules that are supposed to keep communicators honest, they have been slow to step up, as a raging controversy over undisclosed payments to freelance influencers shows.</p>\n\n<p>For the past month, social media has been ablaze with postings about a provocative story <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/\">alleging improper political influence</a> among left-leaning online commentators. Headlined “A Dark Money Group is Secretly Funding High-Profile Democratic Influencers,” it ran in Wired, the San Francisco-based magazine that specializes in tech, and was written by <a href=\"https://www.taylorlorenz.com/\">Taylor Lorenz</a>, a high-profile reporter who has <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/taylor-lorenzs-plan-to-dance-on-legacy-medias-grave\">built a stormy career</a> of tech coverage for outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Atlantic. </p>\n\n<p>The 3,600-word article focused on Chorus, described as a <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/sixteen-thirty-fund/summary?id=D000070975\">secretive arm of the Sixteen Thirty Fund</a>, whose wide-ranging support for progressive causes totals <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/11/14/sixteen-thirty-fund-saw-spending-fundraising-dip-ahead-of-2024-00189729\">more than US$100 million a year</a>. Starting in spring 2025, Lorenz reported, Chorus quietly recruited and supported a coterie of liberal political influencers, with monthly stipends of anywhere from $250 to $8,000.</p>\n\n<p>Just how tightly Chorus sought to control what the 90-some freelancers actually produce is somewhat unclear, and was sharply disputed in the reaction to the article. </p>\n\n<p>But what is clear to me, as a <a href=\"https://journalism.berkeley.edu/person/ed_wasserman/\">journalist and student of media ethics</a>, is that any creators who conceal financial support while weighing in on matters of interest to their funders are, by implication, falsely presenting themselves as independent voices. They are no less deceitful than the business journalist who covers a company they secretly invest in.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN568F1DRmJ&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>Furious response misses the point</h2>\n\n<p>The Wired story declared that the program supporting influencers, called the Chorus Creator Incubator Program, “was aimed at bolstering Democratic messaging on the internet.” Funded commentators got regular briefings with lawmakers and others, organized by Chorus, on newsworthy issues. </p>\n\n<p>The paid influencers also allegedly agreed to forewarn Chorus about interviews with prominent sources, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/\">Lorenz wrote</a>, saying “creators in the program must funnel all bookings with lawmakers and political leaders through Chorus. Creators also have to loop Chorus in on any independently organized engagements with government officials or political leaders.”</p>\n\n<p>And, a big red flag for anyone concerned with ethical communications practices: Participating influencers were also prohibited from telling anybody about the money they were getting.</p>\n\n<p>The Wired story plainly hit a nerve and triggered a spasm of angry postings on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN__-iyjw4_/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@ifeeljaydid_/video/7544792745051704589?q=Taylor%20Lorenz&amp;t=1761136097825\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/redrebel.bsky.social/post/3lxuvygp3vs2s\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P24fZYF6A1A\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mrtelevoid/status/1977883182587396361\">X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16anijgXJz/\">Facebook</a> and other social media sites. But for all their passion, the comments brought to light the disheveled state of online ethics.</p>\n\n<p>Ad hominem attacks predominated. Posts denounced Lorenz <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@littlemissjacob/video/7545347817573715255\">as a liar</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN9GB1ZkoAH/?hl=en\">and a hypocrite</a> who had no business exposing the program because she herself admittedly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN9GB1ZkoAH/?hl=en\">receives similar funding</a>. Some said her real motive was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1n3ztyk/whats_the_deal_with_taylor_lorenzs_new_wired/\">sabotaging the left</a>. Others praised the Chorus program as a valuable attempt <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/progressive-youtuber-savagely-tears-apart-taylor-lorenzs-report-on-dark-money-group-funding-dem-influencers/\">to sharpen the skills of participants</a> and enrich their reporting. Still others asserted that Chorus is not hands-on, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN568F1DRmJ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=66e62ac5-8352-438b-9e0f-0870c2c0aeb4\">never assigns or edits anybody’s stories</a> and is an overdue corrective that gives left-leaning influencers just the kind of support <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN7QCh-DRRJ/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\">the political right has had for years</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Only rarely did the commentary touch on what should have been the white-hot core of the problem: The absence of a shared understanding of the basic responsibilities that online influencers have to the people they serve. Those responsibilities are no different from those of journalists or professional advocates – to come clean.</p>\n\n<p>As Don Heider, head of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/\">told Lorenz with admirable clarity</a>: “If the contract for getting money from a particular interest group says you can’t disclose it, then it’s pretty simple, you can’t take the money.” Or, said the influencer <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thesashawhitney/video/7544024174038175007\">Overopinionatedbrit3</a> on TikTok: “If you are getting paid disclose or you are an influencer being influenced.”</p>\n\n<h2>An obligation to disclose</h2>\n\n<p>The principle of disclosure is one that is widely accepted by professional communicators. </p>\n\n<p>From their earliest iterations a century ago, <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Mass-Media-Ethics/Wilkins-Christians/p/book/9781138681330\">journalism codes</a> have recognized that conflict of interest is perhaps the most toxic threat to the credibility of reporters and the trust they seek from audiences. </p>\n\n<p>The Public Relations Society of America has based its efforts to professionalize advocacy in part on <a href=\"https://www.prsa.org/professional-development/prsa-resources/ethics#code\">an insistence that practitioners not conceal support or withhold information</a> about whose message they are conveying – prohibitions that, sadly, are not universally observed. One notorious breach was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/world/americas/20iht-analyst.4.12169260.html?searchResultPosition=7\">the use of on-air “military analysts” by CNN and other networks</a> during the Iraqi invasion. They were typically former high-ranking officers now employed by arms contractors whose paychecks depended on cordial relations with the Pentagon, but who nevertheless proffered supposedly independent expert appraisals of the U.S. military campaign to CNN viewers. None of that was disclosed to the public. </p>\n\n<p>Femi Redwood, who chairs the <a href=\"https://nabjonline.org/blog/tag/lgbtq/\">National Association of Black Journalists LGBTQ+ task force</a>, was one of the few respondents among the flood of comments on the Wired story who zeroed in on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@femiredwood/video/7544235732668304671\">the absence of online standards</a>. Redwood defined the problem as “the intersection of news and influencing without the ethics of journalism,” and called for a code that would make the ethical obligations of influencers explicit.</p>\n\n<p>The world of influencers is, admittedly, a bit of a Wild West. How universally ethical guidelines would be embraced and whether platforms might find the stomach to consider enforcement remain open – but pivotal – questions. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"TiktokEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@femiredwood/video/7544235732668304671&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<h2>The lure of the high road</h2>\n\n<p>But the social media commentariat may be receptive. </p>\n\n<p>Online practitioners have long claimed greater intellectual independence and cleaner hands than the legacy newspeople they challenge, who they say are trapped in the cobwebs of institutional bias and material thralldom. Much of their claim to the high road has rested on their greater candor – renamed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/jeff-jarvis-when-it-comes-to-new-journalism-transparency-is-the-new-objectivity/\">transparency and hailed as the “new objectivity</a>” – which calls for influencers to fess up about their predispositions and biases rather than go the traditional mainstream route and imply they have none. Secrecy over funding, plainly, is incompatible with such transparency.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in the current moment, when colossal news organizations have been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006\">brought to heel</a> by an administration in Washington that uses their owners’ financial ambitions to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-paramount-warner-bros-discovery-merger-could-give-trump-even-more-influence-over-us-media-shaping-the-news-and-culture-americans-watch-and-stream-265699\">enforce ideological discipline</a>, the influencers’ potential ability to claim moral superiority seems even stronger.</p>\n\n<p>But the freelance model doesn’t ensure independence. It may only create a shifting roster of dependencies and allegiances that are wholly invisible to the audience being served and a potent source of corruption. </p>\n\n<p>Disclosure is an imperfect remedy. But failing to adopt it as a minimum expectation leaves the robust online universe with a moral taint that is lethal to trust.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267905/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Edward Wasserman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Nineteen percent of American adults suffer from an anxiety disorder, and more than 15% have depression.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, about 11% of Americans experience other conditions such as <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9545-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, commonly known as PTSD, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9294-bipolar-disorder\">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20370237\">borderline personality disorder</a> or <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rates of anxiety and depression <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide\">increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. But one positive consequence of the pandemic is that <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/poll-american-workers-are-increasingly-comfortable/\">talking about mental health</a> has become more normalized and less stigmatized, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437251328366\">including in the workplace</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Struggling at work</h2>\n\n<p>For those with mental illness, the traditional expectation of maintaining a strict separation between personal and professional life is not only unrealistic, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-019-09848-z\">it may even be detrimental</a>. The effect of mental illness on a person’s work varies depending on the type, severity and duration of their symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, severe depression can affect basic self-care, making it difficult to complete tasks such as bathing, eating or even getting out of bed. Severe anxiety can also be profoundly debilitating and limit a person’s ability to leave the house due to intense fear or panic. The symptoms of such severe mental illness may make it difficult even to show up to work.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, someone struggling with mild depression or anxiety may have a hard time initiating or completing tasks that they would typically manage with ease and find it difficult to interact with colleagues. Both depression and anxiety may affect sleep, which can contribute to cognitive lapses and increased fatigue during the work day.</p>\n\n<p>Someone with PTSD may find that certain environments remind them of traumatic experiences, making it difficult to fully engage in their work. And a person experiencing a manic episode related to bipolar disorder might need to take time away from work entirely to focus on their stabilization and recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Knowing when to ask for help</h2>\n\n<p>Identifying a trusted colleague, supervisor or human resources representative can be an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-019-09848-z\">important first step in managing your mental health</a> at work. While selecting the right person to confide in may be challenging, especially given the vulnerability associated with disclosing mental health concerns, doing so can open pathways to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-019-09848-z\">appropriate resources and tailored support services</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, it might encourage an employer to consider offering access to free or low-cost mental health care if it’s not already available, or to provide flexible scheduling that makes it easier for employees to get mental health treatment.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also important to be aware of changes in your mental health. The earlier you can recognize signs of decline, the sooner you can get the support that you need, which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00359-7\">might prevent symptoms from worsening</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, sharing sensitive information with someone who is not equipped to respond appropriately <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-019-09848-z\">could lead to unintended consequences</a>, such as workplace gossip, unmet expectations and increased frustration due to perceived lack of support. However, even if your supervisor or manager is not understanding, that doesn’t change the fact that <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/mental-health-at-work\">you have rights in the workplace</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSH75oXHwT0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">In 2022, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that American workplaces needed to change to better support employees’ well-being.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Consider exploring accommodations</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> provides critical protections for individuals with disabilities in the workplace. Under the act, it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against qualified individuals based on a disability.</p>\n\n<p>The law also requires employers to <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/publications/ada-your-employment-rights-individual-disability\">provide reasonable accommodations</a> so that people who qualify are able to participate fully in the workplace provided that they do not impose undue burden on the place of employment.</p>\n\n<p>There are many reasonable <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/program-areas/mental-health/maximizing-productivity-accommodations-for-employees-with-psychiatric-disabilities\">accommodations for workers with mental illness</a>. These can include protected time to attend mental health appointments and flexibility in work schedules and workplace. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, if your job allows for it, working from home can be helpful. If your job requires being on site, a private work space is another reasonable accommodation. Someone with anxiety might find that working in a quiet, private space helps reduce distractions that trigger their symptoms, making it easier for them to stay focused and get things done.</p>\n\n<p>Other possible accommodations include providing sick leave or flexible vacation time to use for mental health days or appointments, or allowing an employee to take breaks according to their individual needs rather than a fixed schedule. Employers can also provide support by offering equipment or technology such as white noise machines or dictation software. </p>\n\n<h2>The role of the workplace</h2>\n\n<p>An organization’s commitment to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-120920-050527\">supporting employee mental health can play a large role</a> in shaping how well employees perform at work – and, ultimately, the organization’s success. </p>\n\n<p>Relying on individual employees to manage their mental health is not a sustainable long-term strategy for employers and may lead to significant workplace disruptions, such as <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Harvard_HE_GlobalEconomicBurdenNonCommunicableDiseases_2011.pdf\">more missed work days and lower productivity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that when employers lead targeted initiatives promoting mental health, <a href=\"https://sheffield.ac.uk/economics/research/impact-and-knowledge-exchange/impact-health-work/impact-health-work/presenteeism-uk-effects-physical-and\">overall workplace functioning and resilience improve</a>. These initiatives might include educating employees on mental health, providing accessible care, helping employees have better work-life balance and designing supportive workplace policies for those who are struggling. These steps help reduce stigma and signal to employees that it’s safe to seek support.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259802/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Julie Wolfe does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Furthermore, no reputable auction house or dealer would knowingly sell stolen art, nor would responsible collectors purchase stolen property.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn’t mean stolen paintings don’t have value.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, <a href=\"https://cmsmc.org/opeds/van-gogh-museum-theft\">thieves broke into Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</a> through the roof and departed with “<a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0416N1990\">View of the Sea at Scheveningen</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0003v1962\">Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen</a>” in tow.

But the crime wasn’t even discovered until an inventory was taken years later. Unable to locate the work, the museum simply removed it from its records.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, collectors Jules and Rachel Lubell <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/27/nyregion/guggenheim-presses-case-on-a-stolen-painting.html\">bought the piece for US$17,000 from a gallery</a>. When the couple requested that an auction house review the work for an estimate, a former Guggenheim employee at Sotheby’s recognized it as the missing painting.</p>\n\n<p>Guggenheim demanded that the painting be returned, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8NcfpJO_RU&amp;t=34s\">a contentious court battle ensued</a>. In the end, the parties settled the case, and the painting was returned to the museum after an undisclosed sum was paid to the collectors. </p>\n\n<p>Some people do knowingly buy stolen art. After World War II, stolen works circulated on the market, <a href=\"https://itsartlaw.org/art-law/from-stolen-heritage-to-restitution-the-story-behind-looted-art/\">with buyers fully aware of the widespread plunder</a> that had just taken place across Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, international laws were developed that gave the original owners the opportunity to recover looted property, even decades after the fact. In the U.S., for example, the law even allows descendants of the original owners <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ308/PLAW-114publ308.pdf\">to regain ownership of stolen works</a>, provided they can offer enough evidence to prove their claims.</p>\n\n<h2>Jewels and gold easier to monetize</h2>\n\n<p>The Louvre theft didn’t involve paintings, though. <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/lifestyle/2025/10/20/what-were-the-jewels-stolen-from-louvre-museum-in-paris/\">The thieves came away with  bejeweled property</a>: <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diadem\">a sapphire diadem</a>; a necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an opulent matching set of earrings and a necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQCnkrakRuy/\">a diamond brooch</a>; and Empress Eugénie’s diadem and her corsage-bow brooch. </p>\n\n<p>These centuries-old, exquisitely crafted works have unique historic and cultural value. But even if each one were broken to bits and sold for parts, they would still be worth a lot of money. Thieves can peddle the precious gemstones and metals to unscrupulous dealers and jewelers, who could reshape and sell them. Even at a fraction of their value – <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2015/may/graddy-stolen-art.html?\">the price received for looted art is always far lower</a> than that received for legitimately sourced art – the gems are worth millions of dollars.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A display case featuring an emerald-and-diamond necklace and a pair of emerald-and-diamond earrings.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698187/original/file-20251023-56-p03qca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An emerald-and-diamond necklace that belonged to Napoleon’s second wife, Empress Marie Louise, was among the items stolen from the Louvre on Oct. 19, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/necklace-and-earrings-from-the-emerald-set-of-napoleon-1-s-news-photo/2241780774?adppopup=true\">Maeva Destombes/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While difficult to sell stolen goods on the legitimate market, there is an underground market for looted artworks.

After making a sale, the vendor may delete his or her online store and disappear.</p>\n\n<h2>A heist’s sensational allure</h2>\n\n<p>While films like “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063688/\">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>” feature dramatic heists pulled off by impossibly attractive bandits, most art crimes are far more mundane. </p>\n\n<p>Art theft is usually a crime of opportunity, and it tends to take place not in the heavily guarded halls of cultural institutions, but in storage units or while works are in transit. </p>\n\n<p>Most large museums and cultural institutions do not display all the objects within their care. Instead, they sit in storage. Less than 10% of the Louvre’s collection is ever on display at one time – <a href=\"https://mini-site.louvre.fr/trimestriel/2020/RA2019/31/#zoom=z\">only about 35,000 of the museum’s 600,000 objects</a>. The rest can remain unseen for years, even decades. </p>\n\n<p>Works in storage can be unintentionally misplaced – like Andy Warhol’s rare silkscreen “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/24/andy-warhol-artwork-accidentally-thrown-out-during-dutch-town-hall-renovation\">Princess Beatrix</a>,” which was likely accidentally discarded, along with 45 other works, during the renovation of a Dutch town hall – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/14/the-big-steal-how-do-ancient-treasures-from-museums-end-up-for-sale-on-the-internet?\">or simply pilfered by employees</a>. According to the FBI, <a href=\"https://itsartlaw.org/art-law/the-inside-job-who-is-protecting-art-museums-from-themselves/#:%7E:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20there%20have,theft%20is%20an%20inside%20job.\">around 90% of museum heists are inside jobs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, days before the Louvre crime, a Picasso work valued at $650,000, “Still Life with Guitar,” <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/picasso-still-life-guitar-missing-spain-intl-scli\">went missing during its journey</a> from Madrid to Granada. The painting was part of a shipment including other works by the Spanish master, but when the shipping packages were opened, the piece was missing. The incident received much less public attention. </p>\n\n<p>To me, the biggest mistake the thieves made wasn’t <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/royal-crown-damaged-brazen-heist-louvre-culture-minister/story?id=126680126\">abandoning the crown they dropped</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/the-louvre-robbery-museum-pgd0z7jl0\">the vest they discarded</a>, essentially leaving clues for the authorities. </p>\n\n<p>Rather, it was the brazen nature of the heist itself – one that captured the world’s attention, all but ensuring that French detectives, independent sleuths and international law enforcement will be on the lookout for new pieces of gold, gems and royal bling being offered up for sale in the years to come.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267947/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Leila Amineddoleh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

As 17th-century French statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert <a href=\"https://www.histoire-en-citations.fr/citations/lecture-recommandee-en-temps-de-vacances-les-memoires-du-xvie-siecle-a-la-monarchie-de\">observed</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In the absence of brilliant deeds of war, nothing proclaims the greatness and spirit of princes more than building works.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Today, the Trump administration is mobilizing heritage and architecture as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci14040235\">tools of ideology and control</a>. In U.S. historic preservation, “heritage” is the shared, living inheritance of places, objects, practices and stories – often plural and contested – that communities value and preserve. America’s architectural heritage is as diverse as the people who created, inhabited and continue to care for it.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMcMfswAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">an archaeologist</a> with three decades of practice, I read environments designed by humans. Enduring modifications to these places, especially to buildings and monuments, carry power and speak across generations. </p>\n\n<p>In his first term as president, and even more so today, Donald Trump has pushed to an extreme legacy-building through architecture and heritage policy. He is remaking the White House physically and metaphorically in his image, consistent with his long record of putting his name on buildings as a developer.  </p>\n\n<p>In December 2020, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/23/2020-28605/promoting-beautiful-federal-civic-architecture\">executive order</a> declaring classical and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/trump-oval-office-gold-before-after-decor-white-house-makeover\">traditional architectural styles</a> the “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/promoting-beautiful-federal-civic-architecture/\">preferred” design for new federal buildings</a>. The order derided Brutalist and modernist structures as inconsistent with <a href=\"https://www.civicart.org/news-and-events/2020/10/13/ncasharris-survey-shows-americans-overwhelmingly-prefer-traditional-architecture-for-federal-buildings\">national values</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Trump is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5540117/government-moves-to-national-scrub-park-sites-of-negative-history\">roll back inclusive historical narratives</a> at U.S. parks and monuments. And he is reviving sanitized myths about America’s history of slavery, misogyny and <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/greg-grandin\">Manifest Destiny</a>, for use <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\">in museums</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-schools-antisemitism-race-gender.html\">textbooks and public schools</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet artifacts don’t lie. And it is the archaeologist’s task to recover these legacies as truthfully as possible, since how the past is remembered shapes the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2024.26\">choices a nation makes about its future</a>. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCmpgjBm7HQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The Trump administration tore down much of the White House East Wing without either consulting historians and preservation experts or opening the project to public comment.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Architecture as political power and legacy</h2>\n\n<p>Dictators, tyrants and kings build monumental architecture to buttress their own egos, which is called <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781003403975-14/authoritarianism-monumentality-graham-livesey\">authoritarian monumentalism</a>. They also seek to build the national ego – another word for nationalism. </p>\n\n<p>Social psychologists have found that the awe we experience when we encounter something vast <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000018\">diminishes the “individual self</a>,” <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-49907-001\">making viewers feel respect and attachment</a> to creators of awesome architecture. Authoritarian monumentalism often exploits this phenomenon. For example, in France, King Louis XIV expanded the Palace of Versailles and renovated its gardens in the mid-1600s to evoke perceptions of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/sociology/social-theory/territorial-ambitions-and-gardens-versailles\">royal grandeur and territorial power</a> in visitors.</p>\n\n<p>Many leaders throughout history have built “temples to power” while erasing or overshadowing the memory of their predecessors – a practice known as <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/04/11/how-do-you-damn-the-memory-of-a-roman-emperor/\">damnatio memoriae</a>, or condemnation to oblivion. </p>\n\n<p>In the ancient world, the Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Romans, Chinese dynasties, Mayans and Incas all left behind <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300246063/the-story-of-architecture/\">architecture that still commands awe</a> in the form of monuments to gods, rulers and communities. These monuments conveyed power and often served as instruments of physical and psychological control.</p>\n\n<p>In the 19th century, Napoleon fused conquest with heritage. Expeditions to Egypt and Rome, and the building of Parisian monuments – the Arc de Triomphe and the Vendôme Column, both modeled on Roman precedents – <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-on-the-Reception-of-Classical-Architecture/Temple-Piotrowski-Heredia/p/book/9781138047112\">reinforced his legitimacy</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Albert Speer’s and Hermann Giesler’s <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16200368M/Neue_deutsche_Baukunst\">monumental neoclassical designs</a> in Nazi Germany, such as the party rally grounds in Nuremberg, were intended to <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Architecture-and-the-Nazi-Cultural-Landscape-Blood-Soil-Building/Haney/p/book/9781032276939?srsltid=AfmBOorUDcJzH_jj6mg-OaeMEtCzWHKSK8MPfMQidKomU8tdHkMxWn6g\">overwhelm the individual and glorify the regime</a>. And Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union suppressed avant-garde experimentation in favor of monumental “socialist realist” architecture, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/arts-theatre-culture/non-western-art/architecture-age-stalin-culture-two\">projecting permanence and centralized power</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Trump has proposed building <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-arch-washington-memorial.html\">his own triumphal arch</a> in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, as a symbol to mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two men in suits standing next to a large model of a city on a table.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=519&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=519&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/698445/original/file-20251024-56-3rhqs6.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=519&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Adolf Hitler and Hermann Giesler discussing a 3D model for a new Munich, Germany that would reflect the ideals of the Third Reich.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.walter-frentz-collection.de/\">Walter Frentz Collection</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An American alternative</h2>\n\n<p>Born of Enlightenment ideals of John Locke, Voltaire and Adam Smith, the American Revolution rejected the European idea of monarchs as semidivine rulers. Instead, leaders were expected to serve the citizenry.   </p>\n\n<p>That philosophy took architectural form in the <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/110000/a-field-guide-to-american-houses-revised-by-virginia-savage-mcalester/\">Federal style</a>, which was dominant from about 1785 to 1830. This clear, democratic architectural language was distinct from Europe’s ornate traditions, and recognizably American.  </p>\n\n<p>Its key features were <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/palladianism-an-introduction\">Palladian proportions</a> – measurements rooted in classical Roman architecture – and an emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/American-Architecture-A-History/Roth-Clark/p/book/9780813349688\">balance, simplicity and patriotic motifs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>James Hoban’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/topics/architecture\">White House</a> and Thomas Jefferson’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/monticello.htm\">Monticello</a> embodied this style. Interiors featured lighter construction, symmetrical lines, and motifs such as eagles, urns and bellflowers. They rejected the opulent <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Rococo\">rococo styles</a> associated with monarchy. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DB1wXJPuatz&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Americans also recognized preservation’s political force. In 1816, the city of Philadelphia bought Independence Hall, which was constructed in 1753 and was where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were debated and signed, to keep it from being demolished. Today the building is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/index.htm\">U.S. National Park</a> and a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/78\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Early preservationists saved George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon, Jefferson’s Monticello, and <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Keeping+Time%3A+The+History+and+Theory+of+Preservation+in+America%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471473770\">other landmarks</a>, tying democracy’s endurance to the built environment. </p>\n\n<h2>Architecture, memory and Trump</h2>\n\n<p>In remaking the White House and prescribing the style and content of many federal sites, Trump is targeting not just buildings but the stories they tell. </p>\n\n<p>By challenging narratives that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-targets-smithsonian-again-says-it-focuses-too-much-how-bad-slavery-was-2025-08-20/\">depart from white, Anglo-Saxon origin myths</a>, Trump is using his power to roll back decades of work toward creating a more inclusive national history. </p>\n\n<p>These actions ignore the fact that America’s strength lies in its identity as a nation of immigrants. The Trump administration has singled out the Smithsonian Institution – the world’s largest museum, founded “<a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/james-smithson\">for the increase and diffusion of knowledge</a> – for ideological reshaping. Trump also is pushing to restore <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-aiming-eliminate-anti-american-ideology-smithsonian-2025-03-27/\">recently removed Confederate monuments</a>, helping to revive \"Lost Cause” mythology about the Civil War.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"InstagramEmbed\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C32pVQiOToX&quot;,&quot;accessToken&quot;:&quot;127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20&quot;}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Trump’s 2020 order declaring classical and traditional architectural styles the preferred design for government buildings echoed authoritarian leaders like Adolf Hitler and Stalin, whose governments sought to dictate aesthetics as expressions of ideology. The American Institute of Architects <a href=\"https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/14842-new-data-shows-americans-prefer-classical-architecture-for-federal-buildings\">publicly opposed the order</a>, warning that it imposed ideological restrictions on design.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s second administration has advanced this agenda by adopting many recommendations in the Heritage Foundation’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/with-blitz-policies-trump-goes-beyond-project-2025s-goals-2025-02-14/\">Project 2025</a> blueprint. Notably, Project 2025 calls for <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">repealing the 1906 Antiquities Act</a> – which empowers presidents to quickly designate national monuments on federal land – and for shrinking many existing monuments. Such rollbacks would undercut the framework that has <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-would-destroy-the-u-s-system-of-checks-and-balances-and-create-an-imperial-presidency\">safeguarded places</a> like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deto/index.htm\">Devils Tower</a> in Wyoming and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm\">Muir Woods</a> in California for over a century.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s new ballroom is a distinct departure from the core values embodied in the White House’s Federal style. Although many commentators have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/trump-s-gilded-design-style-may-be-gaudy-but-don-t-call-it-rococo\">described it as rococo</a>, it is more aligned with the overwrought and opulent styles of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/versailles-mirrored-9781350451353/\">the Gilded Age</a> – a time in American history, from about 1875 through 1895, with many parallels to the present. </p>\n\n<p>In ordering its construction, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/arts/design/trump-ballroom-architects-review.html\">ignored long-standing consultation and review procedures</a> that are central to historic preservation. The demolition of the East Wing may have ignored processes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/white-house-trump-new-ballroom-demolition\">required by law</a> at one of the most important U.S. historic sites.

Their names are called as they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Xl1f-fXLo\">circle around a ring</a> made of partially buried bales of rice straw. Turning toward the center, they clap, lift their aprons, raise their arms upward, and then exit without a word.</p>\n\n<p>Then two of those men face each other, crouching, clapping their hands together and stomping on the ground. They pause repeatedly to rinse their mouths with water and toss salt into the ring. </p>\n\n<p>Overseeing their movements is a man outfitted in a colorful kimono and a black hat resembling that of a Shinto priest and holding a tasseled fan. After a subtle gesture with his fan, they finally grapple – and only then would the uninformed observer realize that the performance was an athletic event.</p>\n\n<p>Every sport has its rituals, from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lhgJXdrWCE\">All Blacks rugby team’s pregame haka</a> to the polite handshake between victor and vanquished over the tennis court net. Some, like many sumo rituals, <a href=\"https://www.sumo.or.jp/pdf/en/sumo_introduction.pdf\">have roots in religious practices</a>.

But those religious roots are still visible. The salt the wrestlers throw, for example, is a purifying element. The clapping is a way of drawing the attention of the gods.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://asian.la.psu.edu/people/jua14/\">a historian of modern Japan</a> and a scholar of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/07075332.2012.626572\">sports and diplomacy</a>, I have seen many ways in which sports are much more than “just a game.” Sport rituals are an important part of those wider meanings. In fact, sumo and its rituals have helped shape foreign perceptions of Japan for at least 170 years. </p>\n\n<h2>First impressions</h2>\n\n<p>The first sumo tournament known to have been observed by American spectators was held in March 1854, in honor of a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/spring/treaty-of-kanagawa\">treaty establishing diplomatic relations</a> between the United States and Japan. Described in the personal <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/japanexpedition10000unse\">journal kept by Commodore Matthew Perry</a>, the leader of the mission to Japan, the exhibition before gawking American sailors seemed designed to impress.</p>\n\n<p>Before the matches began, the athletes put on a performance of strength, loading the American ships with a gift of some 200 bales of rice from the Japanese government. Perry describes how two dozen huge men, “naked with the exception of a narrow girdle around the loins,” paraded before the American crew before getting to work, each shouldering two 135-pound bales.</p>\n\n<p>If the actual sumo competition was intended to inspire appreciation of Japanese culture, it backfired. Perry’s descriptions of the wrestlers were full of unflattering animal metaphors. He wrote that they resembled “stall-fed bulls” more than human beings and made noises like “dogs in combat.” </p>\n\n<p>At the time, sports as we know them today were just <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/games-and-empires/9780231100427/\">emerging in England and the United States</a>. Some of the earliest rules of soccer <a href=\"https://collections.etoncollege.com/the-origins-of-the-field-game/\">were recorded in the 1840s</a>, and baseball’s growing popularity led to the development of professional leagues after the U.S. Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>With this American idea of sports in Perry’s mind, the sumo tournament did not impress him. He called the bouts a “farce” and judged the wrestlers’ physique as one that “to our ideas of athletic qualities would seem to incapacitate him from any violent exercise.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration in muted colors shows two large men wrestling on a platform between red posts, as a large audience watches.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=294&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697678/original/file-20251022-56-mhz04m.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=370&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An illustration of an 1846 sumo tournament by Utagawa Kunisada.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grand-Kanjin-Sumo-Tournament-by-Utagawa-Kunisada-1846.png\">Chunichi.co.jp/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In the mid-19th century, Japan <a href=\"https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/black_ships_and_samurai/bss_essay01.html\">was relatively isolated</a> from the Western world.

The two cultures’ differing ideas of sports meant that sumo only added to American views of Japan as strange and uncivilized.</p>\n\n<h2>A competing sport</h2>\n\n<p>Sports diplomacy had a more positive impact on American views of Japan in the early 20th century, thanks to a different game: baseball.</p>\n\n<p>After the fall of the shogunate in 1868, the new Japanese government – made up of oligarchs ruling in the name of the Meiji Emperor – employed Americans to help implement reforms. Some of them brought along America’s pastime, which <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/9781469622040/transpacific-field-of-dreams/\">became very popular</a> within a few decades. </p>\n\n<p>By the 1910s and ‘20s, Japanese college teams were regularly traveling to the U.S., where newspapers praised their skills and their sportsmanship.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black and white photo shows two rows of men in suits posing outside a large white building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=430&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697680/original/file-20251022-66-yz6c4v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Osaka Mairuchi baseball team from Japan visits the U.S. White House in 1925.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osaka_Mairuchi_baseball_team_from_Japan_at_W.H.,_(i.e.,_White_House,_Washington,_D.C.),_6-4-25_LCCN2016850451.jpg\">National Photo Company Collection/Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Some of the rituals in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-major-league-baseball-keeps-coming-back-to-japan-264668\">a Japanese baseball game</a>, like a ceremonial first pitch, were familiar to American observers. Others, like a team bow toward the umpire, were quite a contrast, but struck them as superior to the rowdiness of American players and fans. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, Japan’s Westernizing reforms and recent military victories <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Sino-Japanese-War-1894-1895\">over China</a> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War\">and Russia</a> had already improved Americans’ impressions of the country. Former baseball player <a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/harry-kingman/\">Harry Kingman</a>, writing about a game he watched during a 1927 stint coaching a Tokyo college team, explained the Japanese turn toward baseball as part of the nation’s modernization.</p>\n\n<p>Sumo, however, continued to be the most popular sport in Japan until the 1990s, when <a href=\"https://www.crs.or.jp/data/pdf/sports25.pdf\">baseball took that title</a>. But the initial popularity of this American import caused some anxiety within the sumo world: A foreign game seemed to be taking over and stealing sumo’s fans.</p>\n\n<p>Amid these changes, professional sumo’s governing institutions, which were divided into competing associations based in Tokyo and Osaka, joined forces. They officially <a href=\"https://intojapanwaraku.com/culture/281606/\">unified in 1925</a> as the organization that would become today’s Japan Sumo Association.</p>\n\n<h2>Can sumo be cool?</h2>\n\n<p>Japanese popular culture now captivates people around the world. In 2002, journalist Douglas McGray wrote about the soft power conferred by what he called the nation’s “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/3183487\">gross national cool</a>.” But he noted sumo as an exception, blaming its leadership’s insular attitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sumo’s biggest hurdle to building an international fan base is its attitude toward foreigners. Immigration is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/japan-xenophobia-immigration-sanseito-antiglobalism-trump-foreigners-358e5eb2b9d6bfe4814cac1b35557e1f\">controversial in Japan</a>.

In 1993, a Hawaiian named Akebono became the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244509059/hawaiian-born-sumo-wrestler-taro-akebono-is-dead-at-54\">first foreigner to reach the top rank</a> of “yokozuna,” sparking a temporary hold on recruiting sumo wrestlers from outside Japan.</p>\n\n<p>Constraints were gradually softened, and the number of non-Japanese professional wrestlers <a href=\"https://sustainable.japantimes.com/magazine/vol51/51-02\">has been rising</a>. They still represent a small minority, but their success often sparks discussions about the place of foreigners in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>Though sumo has gained some traction outside of Japan, its rituals still occasionally create negative impressions of Japanese culture. At a tournament in 2018, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/asia/japan-sumo-women-ring-emergency-intl-trnd\">a local official collapsed</a> while giving a speech. Female medics who rushed to help him were told to leave the sumo ring, considered a sacred space polluted by a woman’s presence. The chairman of the Japan Sumo Association <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/4817\">later apologized</a>, but the incident brought criticism that the sumo world was clinging to anachronistic traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Sumo continues to change. A 1926 Tokyo government <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674056107\">ban on women’s sumo</a> is no longer in force, and there are now some <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2024/06/12/women-fight-for-respect-in-japans-sumo-rings\">female wrestlers in amateur clubs</a>. But women are still barred from professional competition.</p>\n\n<p>Tournaments are certainly popular with tourists, but they generally go for a one-time experience. One might ask if sumo can change enough to play an effective role in Japan’s sports diplomacy. The answer depends on whether sumo leaders are more interested in maintaining the sport’s Japanese identity or building global connections.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263093/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jessamyn R.

The answer might seem simple: virtuous actions – actions that align with morality.</p>\n\n<p>But life is more than doing. Frequently, we just think. We observe and spectate; meditate and contemplate. Life often unfolds in our heads.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://philosophy.richmond.edu/faculty/aenglert/\">a philosopher</a>, I specialize in the Enlightenment thinker <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/\">Immanuel Kant</a>, who had volumes – literally – to say about virtuous actions. What I find fascinating, however, is that Kant also believed people can think virtuously, and should.</p>\n\n<p>To do so, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">he identified three simple rules</a>, listed and explained in his 1790 book, “Critique of the Power of Judgment,” namely: Think for yourself. Think in the position of everyone else. And, finally, think in harmony with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If followed, he thought a “sensus communis,” or “communal sense,” could result, improving mutual understanding by helping people appreciate how their ideas relate to others’ ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Given our current world, with <a href=\"https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2016/\">its “post-truth” culture</a> and isolated echo chambers, I believe Kant’s lessons in virtuous thinking offer important tools today.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 1: Think for yourself</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking can be both active and passive. We can choose where to direct our attention and use reason to solve problems or consider why things happen. Still, we cannot completely control our stream of thought; feelings and ideas bubble up from influences outside our control.</p>\n\n<p>One kind of passive thinking is letting others think for us. Such passive thinking, Kant thought, was not good for anybody. When we accept someone else’s argument without a second thought, it is like handing them the wheel to think for us. But thoughts lie at the foundation of who we are and what we do, thus we should beware of abdicating control.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A formal painting of a man with a gray powdered wig, looking down and wearing a dark suit jacket.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=669&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697538/original/file-20251021-56-m6zqe7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A late 18th-century portrait of Immanuel Kant, possibly by Elisabeth von Stägemann.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Immanuel_Kant_portrait_c1790.jpg\">Norwegian Digital Learning Arena via Wikimedia Commons</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Kant had a word for handing over the wheel: “heteronomy,” or surrendering freedom to another authority.</p>\n\n<p>For him, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511813306\">virtue depended on the opposite</a>: “autonomy,” or the ability to determine our own principles of action.</p>\n\n<p>The same principle holds true for thinking, Kant wrote. We have an obligation to take responsibility for our own thinking and to check its overarching validity and soundness.</p>\n\n<p>In Kant’s day, he was especially concerned about superstition, since it provides consoling, oversimplified answers to life’s problems.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/42425-which-superstitions-are-americans-most-likely-beli\">superstition is still widespread</a>. But many new, pernicious forms of trying to control thought now proliferate, thanks to generative artificial intelligence and the amount of time we spend online. The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-generative-ai-becomes-more-sophisticated-its-harder-to-distinguish-the-real-from-the-deepfake-225768\">rise of deepfakes</a>, the use of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/generative-ai-is-most-useful-for-the-things-we-care-about-the-least-249329\">ChatGPT for creative tasks</a>, and information ecosystems that block out opposing views are but a few examples.</p>\n\n<p>Kant’s Rule 1 tells us to approach content and opinions cautiously. Healthy skepticism provides a buffer and leaves room for reflection. In short, active or autonomous thinking protects people from those who seek to think for them.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 2: Think in the position of everyone else</h2>\n\n<p>Pride often tempts us to believe that we have everything figured out. </p>\n\n<p>Rule 2 checks this pride. Kant recommends what philosophers call “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-socrates-know-nothing-wisdom-can-teach-a-polarized-america-202696\">epistemic humility</a>,” or humility about our own knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping outside our own beliefs isn’t just about opening up new perspectives. It’s also the bedrock of science, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-should-we-trust-science-because-it-doesnt-trust-itself-188988\">seeks shared agreement</a> about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-peer-review-the-role-anonymous-experts-play-in-scrutinizing-research-before-it-gets-published-258255\">what is and is not true</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you’re in a meeting and a consensus is taking shape. Strong personalities and a quorum support it, but you remain unsure.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Rule 2 does not recommend that you adopt the view of the others. Quite the opposite, in fact. If you simply accept the group’s conclusion without further thought, you’d be breaking Rule 1: Think for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Rule 2 prescribes temporarily detaching yourself from even your own way of thinking, especially your own biases. It’s an opportunity to “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">think in the position of everyone else</a>.” What would a fair and discerning thinker make of this situation?</p>\n\n<p>Kant believed that, while difficult, a standpoint can be achieved in which biases all but vanish. We might notice things that we missed before. But this requires appreciating our own limitations and seeking a wider, more universal view.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Kant’s idea of virtue depends on autonomy, so Rule 2 isn’t about letting others think for us. To be responsible for how we shape the world, we must take responsibility for our own thinking, since everything flows from that point outward.</p>\n\n<p>But it emphasizes the “communal” part of the “sensus communis,” reminding us that it must be possible to share what is true.</p>\n\n<h2>Rule 3: Think in harmony with yourself</h2>\n\n<p>The final rule, Kant maintained, is both the most difficult and profound. He said that it was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804656\">the task of becoming “einstimmig</a>,” literally “of one voice” with ourselves.

The blueprint must be sound, the building materials must be high quality, and craftsmanship matters. If the nails are hammered sloppily or steps performed out of order, then the edifice might collapse.</p>\n\n<p>Rule 3 tells us to construct our abode of thought with the same care as when constructing a house, such that stability between the parts results. Each thought, belief and intention is a building block. To be “einstimmig” or “bündig” – to be in “harmony” – these building blocks should fit well together and support each other.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a colleague who you believe has impeccable taste. You trust his opinions. But one day, he shares his secret obsession with death metal music – a genre you dislike.</p>\n\n<p>A disharmony in thought might result. Your reaction to his love of death metal reveals a further belief: Your belief that only people with disturbed taste could love something you perceive to be so grating to the spirit. But he seems, otherwise, like such a thoughtful and pleasant person!</p>\n\n<p>Rather than immediately change your belief about him, Kant’s third rule commands you to investigate the world and your own thoughts further. Perhaps you have never listened to death metal with a discerning spirit. Maybe your original beliefs about your colleague were inaccurate. Or could it be that having good taste is more complex than you originally thought?</p>\n\n<p>Rule 3 leads us to do a system check of our mental architecture, whether we’re considering music, politics, morality or religion. And if that architecture is stable, Kant thinks that rewards will follow.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, harmony is satisfying; but that’s not all. A sturdy system of thought might equip us better for integrated, creative thinking. When I understand how things connect, my own control over them can improve. For example, insight about human psychology will open up new ways to think about morality, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>But ultimately, Kant found harmony important because it supports the construction of a coherent “worldview.” The English language gained that term through the translation of a German word, “Weltanschauung,” <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/jtph-2022-0007/html\">which Kant coined</a> and which has been a focus of my <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/60631\">own work</a>. At its most basic, a harmonious worldview allows us to feel more at home in the world: We gain a sense of how it hangs together, and see it as imbued with meaning.</p>\n\n<p>How we think ultimately determines how we live. If we have a stable abode of thought, we take that stability into everything we do and have some shelter from life’s storms.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263597/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Alexander T.

From the cafes and studios of the 1920s, the term has traveled into common parlance – touching a shared nerve for the strangeness and absurdity of modern life. </p>\n\n<p>But surrealism, the movement that coined the term and took it up as its moniker, was about more than ostentatious strangeness.

This experience opened him to altered mental states and introduced him to new ideas from the Viennese psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud about the <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/surrealism/surrealism-and-dreams\">structure of the human mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In states of psychosis, but also in daily occurrences such as dreams and slips of the tongue, Freud saw glimpses of an uncharted region of the psyche, the unconscious. Why, Breton asked, shouldn’t life, and art, take these aspects of human experience into account? Shouldn’t the portion of existence spent dreaming also be recognized as having value? </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right \">\n            <img alt=\"Orange paper with text printed in French and titled 'Manifeste du Surréalisme'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=899&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696026/original/file-20251013-56-jchmlf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1130&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The publication of André Breton’s ‘Manifesto of Surrealism’ in 1924 is considered the birth of the surrealist movement.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cover-of-andre-bretons-work-quest-ce-que-le-surrealisme-news-photo/152246727\">Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/manifesto-surrealism-andre-breton\">manifesto published in 1924</a>, Breton called for “the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, if one may so speak.”</p>\n\n<h2>Politics of revolution</h2>\n\n<p>Freud had coined the term “dreamwork” to describe the activity that transformed residues of the day’s memories into vehicles for the expression of our unconscious desires. </p>\n\n<p>For the surrealists, too, dreaming was no simple realm of idle fantasy. They understood the synthesis of sleeping and waking life as promising a liberation no less sweeping than that of the <a href=\"https://www.jacobin.com/2023/07/travellers-of-the-world-revolution-excerpt-comintern-history-politics-soviet-union-communist-party\">revolutionary workers’ movement</a> of their time.</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming the contradiction between dream and reality, they believed, would complement the class struggle between the global proletariat and its bourgeois oppressors. Surrealism was much more than a merely artistic project – it was also a means toward a larger political end. </p>\n\n<p>From a century’s distance, these may appear grandiose, even delusional claims. But 1924, the year of surrealism’s founding, was only seven years after the Russian Revolution. The surrealists wagered on the power of both the revolution of modern art and poetry and the political transformation of society. </p>\n\n<p>“‘Transform the world,’ Marx said; ‘change life,’ [French poet Arthur] Rimbaud said. <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/2/2f/Breton_Andre_Manifestoes_of_Surrealism.pdf\">These two watchwords are one for us</a>,” Breton said, speaking to a group of writers in Paris. In other words, the uncompromising project of remaking social existence would not be complete without the artistic reimagining of the human psyche, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>But by 1935, when Breton pronounced this succinct formulation, the surrealists’ gamble on revolution had already effectively been lost. With <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/great-purge\">Joseph Stalin’s purges</a> underway in Moscow and <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nazi-rise-to-power\">Adolf Hitler consolidating power in Germany</a>, the window for radical change that had seemed to open in the years after World War I was definitively closing. </p>\n\n<p>Soon, the surrealists would find themselves dispersed into exile by a new global conflict. All that remained was for the museums and libraries to collect the relics of that heady ideal and to preserve the artworks and ephemera that registered surrealism’s brief quest to unleash the forces of the unconscious in the name of a new, freer world.</p>\n\n<h2>Surrealism’s unfinished business</h2>\n\n<p>The surrealists aimed to seduce their audiences. That seduction was not undertaken to sell their paintings, or even to provide their audiences a moment’s respite from harried lives. It was done in the name of subversion. They wished – through artworks, films and books – to shatter people’s complacency and move them to change their lives, and the world.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Woman in foreground, blurred, shown passing a colorful painting of tree with human face\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696030/original/file-20251013-56-uirto1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A visitor to the Paris exhibition walks past René Magritte’s surrealist ‘Alice in Wonderland,’ painted in 1946.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/FranceSurrealismExhibition/c8f59616f2c54432ab9220896f4c95d6/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Christophe Ena</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The artwork wasn’t a mere window through which to look onto a distant “dreamworld.” It was more like a revolving door one was invited to walk through.

Those workers had to stop their work of monitoring and inspecting industrial sites for pollution, and stopped enforcing environmental-protection laws, including the Clean Air Act.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I analyzed six years’ worth of air quality levels, emissions measurements, power production data and weather reports for more than 200 coal-fired power plants around the country. We found that the coal plants’ operators appeared to take advantage of the lapse in enforcement of environmental regulations. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/733758\">started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution</a>. And as soon as the government reopened and inspections resumed, pollution levels dropped.</p>\n\n<h2>Particulate matter is dangerous</h2>\n\n<p>The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history up until that time <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41759\">began on Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted until Jan. 25, 2019</a>. During that period, about 95% of EPA employees were furloughed, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/climate/epa-pollution-inspection-shutdown.html\">nearly all the agency’s pollution inspectors</a>, who keep track of whether industrial sites like coal-fired power plants follow rules meant to limit air pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Among those rules are strict limits on a type of pollution called <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health\">particulate matter</a>, which is sometimes called PM2.5 and PM10. These microscopic particles are smaller than the width of a human hair. When inhaled, they can <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics\">travel deep into the lungs</a> and even get into the bloodstream. Even short-term exposure to particulates <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/what-makes-air-unhealthy/particle-pollution\">increases the risk of asthma, heart disease</a> and premature death.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An illustration shows a human hair and a grain of beach sand to compare with the size of particulate matter.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=419&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696979/original/file-20251017-56-6n36ca.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=526&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Particulate matter pollution is much smaller than a human hair or even a fine grain of sand.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To determine whether coal-fired power plants continued to obey the rules even when environmental inspectors were furloughed and not watching, we examined data on emissions of more than 200 coal-fired power plants across the country. We looked at satellite data from NASA that provides a reliable indicator of <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/atmosphere/aerosol-optical-depth-thickness\">particulate pollution in the atmosphere</a>. We also looked at the amounts of several types of chemicals recorded directly from smokestacks and sent to the EPA.</p>\n\n<p>We looked at each plant’s daily emissions before, during and after the 2018-2019 shutdown, and compared them with the plants’ emissions on the same calendar days in the five previous years, when EPA inspectors were not furloughed.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"3Edmv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3Edmv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Pollution rose and fell with the shutdown</h2>\n\n<p>We found that as soon as the EPA furlough began in 2018, <a href=\"https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/MOD04_3K\">particulate emissions</a> within 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) around the coal-fired power plants rose, according to the NASA data.</p>\n\n<p>The data indicated that, on average, particulate matter during the 2018 and 2019 shutdown was 15% to 20% higher than it had been during the same period in the preceding five years.</p>\n\n<p>And once the EPA inspectors returned to work, the plants’ average particulate pollution dropped back to its pre-shutdown level.</p>\n\n<p>We also found that two other common air pollutants from coal-fired power plants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, did not increase during the furlough period. Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-continuous-emission-monitoring-systems\">continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks</a>, even when the federal government is not operating. Particulate emissions, however, are not continuously monitored: Enforcement of those emissions standards relies on the manual collection of samples from monitors and on-site inspections, both of which halted during the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern was clear: When the EPA stopped watching, coal plants increased pollution. And once inspections resumed, emissions dropped back to normal.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"HvtsS\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HvtsS/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Considering various explanations</h2>\n\n<p>To confirm that the increase in particulate pollution during the shutdown was due to the lack of inspections and not because of some other factors such as weather fluctuations, we tested a range of alternative explanations and found that they did not fit the data we had collected. </p>\n\n<p>For example, weather records showed that <a href=\"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html\">wind</a>, <a href=\"http://prism.oregonstate.edu\">humidity and temperature</a> at and around the coal plants during the shutdown were all within the same ranges as they had been over the previous five years. So the increased particulate pollution during the shutdown was not due to different weather conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Electricity demand – <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/\">how much power the plants were generating</a> – was also typical, and did not increase significantly during the shutdown. That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis also revealed that the coal plants didn’t shift which particular boilers were operating to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=107&amp;t=3\">less efficient ones</a> that would have produced more particulates. So the increase in pollution during the shutdown wasn’t due to just using different equipment to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p>The emissions data we collected also included <a href=\"https://campd.epa.gov/\">carbon dioxide emissions</a>, which gave us insight into what the coal plants were burning. With similar weather conditions and amounts of electricity generated, different types of coal emit different amounts of carbon dioxide. So if we had found carbon dioxide emissions changed, it could have signaled that the plants had changed to burning another type of coal, which could emit more particulate matter – but we did not. This showed us that the increase in particulate emissions was not from changing the specific types of coal being burned to generate electricity. </p>\n\n<p>All of these tests helped us determine that the spike in particulate matter pollution was unique to the 2018–2019 EPA furlough.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"dMaGR\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dMaGR/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Spewing particulate matter</h2>\n\n<p>All of this analysis led us to one final question: Was it, in fact, possible for coal-fired power plants to quickly increase – and then decrease – the amount of particulate matter they emit? The answer is yes. Emissions-control technology does indeed allow that to happen. </p>\n\n<p>Power plants control their particulate emissions with a device called an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-monitoring-knowledge-base/monitoring-control-technique-electrostatic-precipitators\">electrostatic precipitator</a>, which uses static electricity to collect particles from smoke and exhaust before it exits the smokestack. Those devices use electricity to run, which costs money, even for a power plant. Turning them off when the plants are being monitored <a href=\"https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/enforcement/sinclair-clean-air-act-settlement_.html\">risks incurring heavy fines</a>. But when oversight disappeared, the power plants could save money by turning those devices off or reducing their operation, with less risk of being caught and fined.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings indicate that air pollution regulations are only as effective as their enforcement, which had already been decreasing before the 2018 shutdown. Between 2007 and 2018, EPA’s enforcement staff declined by more than 20%, and the number of <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf\">inspections dropped by one-third</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new administration took office in January 2025, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-administration-is-on-track-to-cut-1-in-3-epa-staffers-by-the-end-of-2025-slashing-agencys-ability-to-keep-pollution-out-of-air-and-water-265249\">EPA staffing has been reduced significantly</a>. We found that without strong and continuous monitoring and enforcement, environmental laws risk becoming hollow promises.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267696/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In fact, only about 1 in 4 youths <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.09.041\">maintain positive health behavior patterns</a> during the transition to adulthood. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\">More Americans die of heart disease</a> than of any other condition. People often think of heart disease as an illness that mostly affects older people, but data from electronic health records show that the rate of heart disease in people under 40 has more than <a href=\"https://epicresearch.org/articles/cardiovascular-disease-rates-in-young-adults-have-more-than-doubled-since-2010\">doubled since 2010 and tripled among people who use tobacco</a>. Researchers like me are learning a great deal more about how heart health later in life heavily depends on the habits built during late adolescence and early adulthood. </p>\n\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/nursing/faculty-staff/scottj.php\">primary care nurse practitioner</a> and researcher studying <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iE5bQx0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">how early life shapes long-term heart health</a>. In my clinical practice, I frequently care for people in their early 20s who are entering adulthood and are already facing serious cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar or <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bmi-alone-will-no-longer-be-treated-as-the-go-to-measure-for-weight-management-an-obesity-medicine-physician-explains-the-seismic-shift-taking-place-208174\">a body mass index</a> in the obesity range. </p>\n\n<p>Just as young people on the cusp of adulthood make important decisions about their education, career and relationships, the health habits they build during this critical time also lay the foundation for lifelong heart health <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.105772\">and better quality of life</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Early roots of heart disease</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100371\">most common form of heart disease</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis\">atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</a>, which develops when sticky, fatty plaque builds up in the blood vessels and makes it harder for blood to flow. </p>\n\n<p>Heart health doesn’t suddenly decline in middle age. It starts to slip much earlier, often without people realizing it. In fact, research shows that a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab149\">key turning point is around age 17</a>. That’s when overall heart health scores based on behaviors such as diet, movement and sleep, along with clinical measures such as blood pressure, begin to worsen.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WuXQEZBMmGU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Age 17 is a key turning point when heart health scores can begin to decline in young people.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>That means by the time many young people are finishing high school, heart disease risk factors are already emerging. The good news is that most of the risk factors that drive this buildup are modifiable – meaning you can do something about them. </p>\n\n<p>In a report I co-authored in March 2025, my colleagues and I explored the key risk factors for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.124.039239\">heart disease in emerging adults</a>. One of the most important is nicotine exposure. Use of cigarettes, vapes and other nicotine products has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19022\">surged among young adults in recent years</a>, from 21% of 18- to 23-year-olds in 2002 to 43% in 2018. Nicotine <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.01.003\">damages blood vessels and speeds up the plaque formation</a> process, increasing the risk of serious heart problems later in life. While signs such as chest discomfort or shortness of breath tend to show up much later, the groundwork for those symptoms is laid much earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Obesity is another early risk factor. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data-and-statistics/adult-obesity-prevalence-maps.html\">1 in 5 young people under age 25 have a BMI of 30</a> or higher, and projections suggest <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1703860\">nearly 3 in 5 will meet that threshold by age 35</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.14517\">fewer than half of adults ages 18-34</a> recognize high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure and lack of physical activity as heart disease risk factors. These early warning signs, often uncovered during routine checkups, can set the stage for future heart disease.  </p>\n\n<h2>Societal factors shape heart health, too</h2>\n\n<p>Heart health isn’t shaped by individual choices alone. Broader policies and systems also play a major role. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Affordable Care Act <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/young-adult-and-aca\">allows young adults to stay</a> on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26, which can help ensure access to preventive services. These services, such as routine checkups, blood pressure screenings and conversations about family history, are key opportunities for your primary care provider to catch early signs of cardiovascular risk. </p>\n\n<p>While preventive care use among young adults increased after the ACA was passed, overall <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.12.004\">rates of preventive care visits still remain low</a>. Policies that expand access to health care and that make it easy for young people to take advantage of these services, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968221146806\">such as telehealth</a>, can make a real difference. And if a provider doesn’t bring up heart health during a well-check visit, <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/doctor-appointments-questions-to-ask-your-doctor\">patients can ask questions or start the conversation</a> themselves.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An instructor leads an outdoor exercise class.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=379&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697322/original/file-20251020-66-jzo053.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=476&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Living in a neighborhood with access to outdoor spaces can make it easier to engage in activities that support heart health.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/african-american-man-leading-exercise-class-royalty-free-image/1092427244\">kali9/E+ via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Beyond health care access, the conditions of people’s daily lives, such as where they live, their education level and their economic stability, also play important roles in heart health. Neighborhoods can include <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.036035\">resources such as parks and green spaces</a>, which make healthy choices more feasible. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216611\">Education and stable employment</a> are tied to health care access, lower stress and food security, all of which support a healthier heart.</p>\n\n<p>Healthy social connections matter, too. Strong, supportive relationships are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1377/hpb20200622.253235\">linked to better overall well-being</a>, including heart health. Recently, several major health organizations have spotlighted <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">loneliness as a public health issue</a>. However, there is still a lot to learn about exactly how <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/curing-americas-loneliness-epidemic-would-make-us-healthier-fitter-and-less-likely-to-abuse-drugs-206059\">social connections translate to healthier lives</a>, and not enough of this research focuses on young adults. </p>\n\n<p>Pew research shows that 1 in 3 teens report <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/\">near-constant use of social media</a>, but those connections do not yield the same health benefits as interacting in real life. In my own research, I am investigating how social connection affects heart health in young adults in particular.</p>\n\n<h2>Building a foundation for heart health</h2>\n\n<p>There is a lot you can do today to make a difference in your heart health. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.124.039239\">In our recent report</a>, written with the American Heart Association, my colleagues and I highlighted a group of eight risk factors that people can modify to reduce their heart disease risk, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001078\">called the Essential 8</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Dpl4MS1EKw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Embracing the Essential 8, a set of evidence-based measures developed by the American Heart Association, can help young people establish lifelong habits for a healthy heart.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8\">Four are health behaviors</a>. In addition to avoiding nicotine, young people should prioritize getting 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a week, or around 20 minutes a day, as <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults\">recommended by the American Heart Association</a>. They should also aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep nightly and to eat a diet rich in fish, berries and vegetables. Even small changes in these four behaviors can have positive effects.</p>\n\n<p>Of these four behaviors, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.122.060911\">U.S. children score worst on diet</a> – an important area for improvement in the transition to adulthood. Young adults with stronger cooking skills tend to have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2018.01.021\">healthier eating habits in middle age</a>, suggesting that learning how to cook could be a valuable step toward better heart health.   </p>\n\n<p>The other <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8\">four factors are clinical measures</a>: blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI. Since the early 2000s, three of the four – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100452\">blood pressure, blood sugar and BMI – have all worsened</a> among young adults. </p>\n\n<p>These changes can go unnoticed until much later, but checking in on them early creates an opportunity to take action. The next time you are at a checkup, ask your provider about your heart health – even if you think you’re too young to be worrying about heart disease. A simple conversation today could shape the way you feel years from now, and your future heart will thank you.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254276/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jewel Scott receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Others, including former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and former Reagan administration Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, have been <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/5-people-who-lied-congress-what-happened-them-n941936\">prosecuted for the same type of crimes</a> – allegedly making false statements to Congress or unlawfully seeking to influence or obstruct a Senate investigation.</p>\n\n<h2>Vindictive prosecution</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.59.4.pdf\">Due to Trump’s repeated</a> statements and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-vindictive-prosecution.html\">social media posts that Comey should be charged</a>, proving a vindictive prosecution may be easier. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the motion to dismiss starts by laying out the argument for a vindictive prosecution, signaling that Comey’s lawyers think this is the stronger argument by leading with it. </p>\n\n<p>Still, if Comey’s lawyers are to convince the judge, they will have to overcome a heavy burden that the prosecution has exceeded the broad discretion of the prosecutor. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=lawreview\">legal standard requires</a> a court to first find that the prosecutor had animus, hostility, toward Comey, and second, that the charges would not have been brought if there was no animus. </p>\n\n<p>The motion to dismiss based on vindictive prosecution makes a very strong showing of animus, relying on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-vindictive-prosecution.html\">Trump’s several statements and social media posts</a> that Comey should be prosecuted and that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">Comey was a “Dirty Cop” and “a total SLIMEBALL!</a>” </p>\n\n<p>Further evidence involves the fact that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/22/trump-comey-prosecutor-appointments/\">no other prosecutor</a> other than Trump’s former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, would seek charges against Comey. </p>\n\n<p>Still, the grand jury found probable cause for the two charges against Comey and issued the indictment. The government will likely argue that demonstrates that the charges could have been brought even if there was animus.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A social media post in which the president urges prosecution of James Comey and others.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=547&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=547&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=547&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=687&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=687&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697916/original/file-20251022-56-cjcibk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=687&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A social media post by President Donald Trump urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his perceived enemies, including James Comey.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Truth Social Donald Trump account</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Fallback position</h2>\n\n<p>Comey’s lawyers are leaning heavily on arguments for a dismissal of the charges with prejudice, but they also have a fallback position. </p>\n\n<p>If the judge determines that they have not proved a selective or vindictive prosecution, they are asking for the opportunity to obtain discovery – the record – of the government’s decision to seek charges from the grand jury, and a hearing on their motion to dismiss the indictment. </p>\n\n<p>Given Trump’s public statements and social media posts, and the legal authority on this issue, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/peter-a-joy-146904\">as a longtime practitioner and teacher of criminal law</a>, I believe the judge is very likely to choose this course of action.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how the trial judge rules on the motion to dismiss, the losing side is certain to appeal.

They provide independent living assistance, disaster relief and emergency shelter, among other services.</p>\n\n<p>Our team found that 21% lost a grant or contract, 27% faced delays or funding freezes and 6% were hit with stop-work orders. Some of the nonprofits had experienced more than one of these funding problems, which affected nonprofits of all kinds. But they were especially disruptive to larger ones that employ more people and provide key services, such as large social service agencies, food banks and organizations serving people <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-medicaid-and-americas-long-struggle-to-establish-a-health-care-safety-net-251776\">enrolled in Medicaid</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"pEulW\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pEulW/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>These findings came from the most recent <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/nptrends\">Nonprofit Trends and Impacts</a> survey, which we conducted from April to June 2025 with colleagues at the Urban Institute, including <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/laura-tomasko\">Laura Tomasko</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/hannah-martin\">Hannah Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/katie-fallon\">Katie Fallon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/elizabeth-t-boris\">Elizabeth T. Boris</a>. They follow findings from a prior survey that the project fielded between October 2024 and January 2025.</p>\n\n<p>When funding dries up, nonprofits tend to shrink and scale back their services. About 21% of those hit by funding cuts in the first half of 2025 were already serving fewer people by the time they <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-government-funding-disruptions-affected-nonprofits-early-2025\">completed the survey in April, May and June 2025</a>, and 29% had reduced their staff. Many of these nonprofit leaders also told us they expect to have to lay off more of their employees by the end of 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits had already been facing financial pressure.</p>\n\n<p>In the prior round of the survey that our team conducted in the fall of 2024, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/nonprofit-leaders-top-concerns-entering-2025\">more than half of nonprofit leaders said they were worried</a> about their organization’s finances. Many of them said they had received less money through donations and were facing tougher competition when they applied for grants, largely due to a tougher economic climate and the end of federal funding that had been disbursed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Nonprofits often partner with the government to deliver essential services. This <a href=\"https://independentsector.org/resource/health-of-the-u-s-nonprofit-sector/\">government support is vital</a> – it makes up about 20% of the revenue that most nonprofits rely on. What’s more, government funding provided <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/government-grants-and-contracts-nonprofits-2023\">more than half of total revenue for about 1 in 5</a> service-oriented nonprofits in 2023, which is the most recent data available.</p>\n\n<p>That same year, about 2 in 3 nonprofits received <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/government-grants-and-contracts-nonprofits-2023\">at least one federal, state or local government grant or contract</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Government funding made up <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-government-funding-disruptions-affected-nonprofits-early-2025\">42% of total revenue</a> for service-providing nonprofits that experienced government funding disruptions in our 2025 survey. The rest of their funding came from donations, foundation grants and service fees.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits get less than half of their <a href=\"https://independentsector.org/resource/health-of-the-u-s-nonprofit-sector/\">total revenue from foundations and individual donations</a>, and total government funding for nonprofits <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-financial-risk-nonprofits-losing-government-grants\">amounts to around three times total foundation funding</a>. That makes it unlikely that philanthropy will replace the government funding that’s being lost.</p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>Nonprofits from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-funding-cuts-nonprofits-funding-freeze-social-safety-net-welfare-ed2e5b30445c9ffdb07346e42c0abfa3\">California</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2025/10/07/local-nonprofits-government-shutdown-impact.html\">Florida</a> are seeing their funding withheld, and the government shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, is compounding the effects of the Trump administration’s longer-term spending cuts. The full extent of the impacts of these federal disruptions on nonprofits’ budgets won’t be known until 2026 or later.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/Methodology_of_the_National_Surveys_of_Nonprofit_Trends_and_Impacts_2024_and_2025.pdf\">our survey doesn’t include</a> the leaders of very small nonprofits, or several kinds of nonprofits – including hospitals, colleges, universities, churches and foundations.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>Our upcoming Nonprofit Trends and Impacts surveys in early 2026 will convey more of the effects of government funding cuts on nonprofits’ budgets and programs.</p>\n\n<p>A more complete picture will not be possible until the Internal Revenue Service publishes data that it <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019\">collects from the 990 form</a> that most charitable nonprofits must file on an annual basis. Historically, The IRS has <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/data-nonprofits-government-funding-have-four-main-limitations-national-survey-nonprofit\">taken years to release</a> comprehensive nonprofit financial data, requiring additional research beyond the 990 form.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267795/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lewis Faulk is a Non-Resident Fellow of the Urban Institute.

In contrast, human eyes perform these same functions using soft, flexible tissues in a highly compact form.</p>\n\n<p>Our lens, called the photo-responsive hydrogel soft lens, or PHySL, replaces rigid components with soft polymers acting as artificial muscles. The polymers are composed of a <a href=\"https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-what-is-a-hydrogel\">hydrogel</a> − a water-based polymer material. This hydrogel muscle changes the shape of a soft lens to alter the lens’s focal length, a mechanism analogous to the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470669/figure/myopia.F7/\">ciliary muscles</a> in the human eye.</p>\n\n<p>The hydrogel material contracts in response to light, allowing us to control the lens without touching it by projecting light onto its surface. This property also allows us to finely control the shape of the lens by selectively illuminating different parts of the hydrogel. By eliminating rigid optics and structures, our system is flexible and compliant, making it more durable and safer in contact with the body.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Artificial vision using cameras is commonplace in a variety of technological systems, including robots and medical tools. The optics needed to form a visual system are still typically restricted to rigid materials using electric power. This limitation presents a challenge for emerging fields, including <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.99907-0\">soft robotics</a> and biomedical tools that integrate soft materials into flexible, low-power and autonomous systems. Our soft lens is particularly suitable for this task.</p>\n\n<p>Soft robots are machines made with compliant materials and structures, taking inspiration from animals. This additional flexibility makes them more durable and adaptive. Researchers are using the technology to develop <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2010\">surgical endoscopes</a>, grippers for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2024.115380\">handling delicate objects</a> and robots for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4063669\">navigating environments</a> that are difficult for rigid robots. </p>\n\n<p>The same principles apply to biomedical tools. Tissuelike materials can soften the interface between body and machine, making biomedical tools safer by making them move with the body. These include <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0217328\">skinlike wearable sensors</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2024.103358\">hydrogel-coated implants</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"three photos showing a rubbery disk held between two hands\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=191&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=191&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=191&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=240&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=240&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697600/original/file-20251021-56-2geixz.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=240&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">This variable-focus soft lens, shown viewing a Rubik’s Cube, can flex and twist without being damaged.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Corey Zheng/Georgia Institute of Technology</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What other research is being done in this field</h2>\n\n<p>This work merges concepts from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.678046\">tunable optics</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.3c00967\">soft “smart” materials</a>.

This is the surprising takeaway of a new study that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09655-y\">we and our colleagues published in the journal Nature</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While developing mRNA vaccines for patients with brain tumors in 2016, our team, led by <a href=\"https://directory.ufhealth.org/sayour-elias\">pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour</a>, discovered that mRNA can train immune systems to kill tumors – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01380-1\">even if the mRNA is not related to cancer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mRNA vaccines designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 might also have antitumor effects. </p>\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqVdPM4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">we looked at clinical outcomes</a> for more than 1,000 late-stage melanoma and lung cancer patients treated with a type of immunotherapy called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006\">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>. This treatment is a common approach doctors use to train the immune system to kill cancer. It does this by blocking a protein that tumor cells make to turn off immune cells, enabling the immune system to continue killing cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkably, patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy were more than twice as likely to be alive after three years compared with those who didn’t receive either vaccine. Surprisingly, patients with tumors that don’t typically respond well to immunotherapy also saw very strong benefits, with nearly fivefold improvement in three-year overall survival. This link between improved survival and receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine remained strong even after we controlled for factors like disease severity and co-occurring conditions.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the underlying mechanism, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2q2tK8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">we turned to animal models</a>. We found that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines act like an alarm, triggering the body’s immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells and overcome the cancer’s ability to turn off immune cells. When combined, vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors coordinate to unleash the full power of the immune system to kill cancer cells.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D_Iz9s9Y6k?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">University of Florida Health pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, who led the research, explains that mRNA vaccines that are not specific to a patient’s cancer can ‘wake up the sleeping giant that is the immune system to fight cancer.’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006\">revolutionized cancer treatment</a> over the past decade by producing cures in many patients who were previously considered incurable. However, these therapies are ineffective in patients with <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cold-tumor\">“cold” tumors</a> that successfully evade immune detection.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that mRNA vaccines may provide just the spark the immune system needs to turn these “cold” tumors “hot.” If validated in our upcoming clinical trial, our hope is that this widely available, low-cost intervention could extend the benefits of immunotherapy to millions of patients who otherwise would not benefit from this therapy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Countless clear vials of liquid with labels reading 'CANCER mRNA vaccine 10 ML' on a table\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696810/original/file-20251016-56-twtgtv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Combining immunotherapy with mRNA vaccines could allow more patients to benefit from this treatment.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/mrna-cancer-vaccines-conceptual-illustration-royalty-free-illustration/2167929866?phrase=cancer%20mrna%20vaccines&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Thom Leach/Science Photo Library via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>What other research is being done</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike vaccines for infectious diseases, which are used to prevent an infection, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003\">therapeutic cancer vaccines</a> are used to help train the immune systems of cancer patients to better fight tumors. </p>\n\n<p>We and many others are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003\">currently working hard</a> to make <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/customizing-mrna-is-easy-and-thats-what-makes-it-the-next-frontier-for-personalized-medicine-a-molecular-biologist-explains-216127\">personalized mRNA vaccines</a> for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/brain-cancer-in-children-is-notoriously-hard-to-treat-a-new-mrna-cancer-vaccine-triggers-an-attack-from-within-228666\">patients with cancer</a>.

Ultimately, we hope that this approach will help many patients who are treated with immune therapy, and especially those who currently lack effective treatment options.</p>\n\n<p>This work exemplifies how a tool born from a global pandemic may provide a new weapon against cancer and rapidly extend the benefits of existing treatments to millions of patients. By harnessing a familiar vaccine in a new way, we hope to extend the lifesaving benefits of immunotherapy to cancer patients who were previously left behind.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258992/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Adam Grippin receives funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Brain Tumor Association, and the Radiological Society of North America.

According to our new research, how someone views billionaires isn’t just about economics. Judgment also hinges on certain cultural and moral instincts, which helps explain why opinions about wealth are so polarized.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf158\">The study</a>, which my colleague <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xvOcrtUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Mohammad Atari</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9WB4v4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and I</a> published in the research journal PNAS Nexus in June 2025, examined survey data from more than 4,300 people across 20 countries. We found that while most people around the world do not strongly condemn having “too much money,” there are striking cultural differences.</p>\n\n<p>In wealthy, more economically equal countries such as Switzerland and Belgium, people were more likely to say that having too much money is immoral. In countries that are poorer and more unequal, such as Peru or Nigeria, people tended to view wealth accumulation as more acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond economics, we found that judgments about excessive wealth are also shaped by deeper moral intuitions. Our study drew on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000470\">moral foundations theory</a>, which proposes that people’s sense of right and wrong is built on six core values – care, equality, proportionality, loyalty, authority and purity. We found that people who highly value equality and purity were more likely to see excessive wealth as wrong. </p>\n\n<p>The equality result was expected, but the role of purity was more surprising. Purity is usually associated with ideas about cleanliness, sanctity or avoiding contamination – so finding that it is associated with negative views about wealth gives new meaning to the phrase “filthy rich.” </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.jacksonptrager.com/\">a social psychologist</a> who studies morality, culture and technology, I’m interested in how these kinds of judgments differ across groups and societies. Social and institutional systems interact with individual moral beliefs, shaping how people view culture war issues such as wealth and inequality − and, in turn, how they engage with the policies and conflicts that emerge around them.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>Billionaires wield growing influence in politics, technology and global development. The richest 1% of people on Earth <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-top-1-own-more-wealth-95-humanity-shadow-global-oligarchy-hangs-over-un\">own more wealth than 95% of people combined</a>, according to Oxfam, an organization focused on fighting poverty. </p>\n\n<p>Efforts to address inequality by taxing or regulating the rich may, however, rest on a mistaken assumption — that the public generally condemns extreme wealth. If most people instead view amassing wealth as morally justifiable, such reforms could face limited support.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that in countries where inequality is highly visible and persistent, people may adapt by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1994.tb01008.x\">morally justifying their structural economic system</a>, arguing that it is fair and legitimate. In wealthier, more equal societies, people appear more sensitive to the potential harms of excess.</p>\n\n<p>While our study shows that most people around the world do not view excessive wealth as morally wrong, those in wealthier and more equal countries are far more likely to condemn it. </p>\n\n<p>That contrast raises a sharper question: When people in privileged societies denounce and attempt to limit billionaires, are they shining a light on global injustice − or projecting their own sense of guilt? Are they projecting a moral principle shaped by their own prosperity onto poorer countries, where wealth may represent survival, progress or even hope? </p>\n\n<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>\n\n<p>One open question: How do these views change over time? Do attitudes shift when societies become wealthier or more equal? Are young people more likely than older generations to condemn billionaires? Our study offers a snapshot, but long-term research could reveal whether moral judgments track broader economic or cultural changes.</p>\n\n<p>Another uncertainty is the unexpected role of purity. Why would a value tied to cleanliness and sanctity shape how people judge billionaires? <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf158\">Our follow-up study</a> found that purity concerns extended beyond money to other forms of “excess,” such as disapproving of having “too much” ambition, sex or fun. This suggests that people may see excess itself – not just inequality – as corrupting.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n\n<p>We’re continuing to study how cultural values, social systems and moral intuitions shape people’s judgments of fairness and excess – from views of wealth and ambition to knowledge and AI computing power.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these gut-level, moral reactions within larger social systems matters for debates about inequality. But it can also help explain how people evaluate technologies, leaders and institutions that accumulate disproportionate, excessive power or influence.</p>\n\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231\">Research Brief</a> is a short take on interesting academic work.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265247/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jackson Trager does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

This doesn’t exist yet, but space commerce is a growing industry. The <a href=\"https://www.spacefoundation.org/2025/07/22/the-space-report-2025-q2/\">Space Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization for education and advocacy of space, estimates that the global space economy rose to US$613 billion in 2024, up nearly 8% from 2023, and 250 times larger than <a href=\"https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=112996\">all business at farmer’s markets in the United States</a>. This number includes launch vehicles, satellite hardware, and services provided by these space-based assets, such as satellite phone or internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>Companies involved in spaceflight have been around since the start of the Space Age. By the 1980s, corporate space activity was gaining traction. President Ronald Reagan saw the need for a federal agency to oversee and guide this industry and <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/law/office-of-space-commerce/\">created the Office of Space Commerce</a>, or OSC.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The logo of the OSC, which is circular and has three stars and nine black and white stripes.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696558/original/file-20251015-56-83n2aw.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=754&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Office of Space Commerce is under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/OSC-logo-2025-1721x1721-1.png\">Office of Space Commerce − National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>So, what exactly does this office do and why is it important?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B1GhRV4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">As a space scientist</a>, I am interested in how the U.S. regulates commercial activities in space. In addition, I teach a course on space policy. In class, we talk about the OSC and its role in the wider regulatory landscape affecting commercial use of outer space. </p>\n\n<h2>The OSC’s focus areas</h2>\n\n<p>The Office of Space Commerce, an office of <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/about/organization-and-staffing/\">about 50 people</a>, exists within the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To paraphrase its <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/about/\">mission statement</a>, its chief purpose is to enable a robust U.S. commercial interest in outer space. </p>\n\n<p>OSC has three main focus areas. First, it is the office responsible for licensing and monitoring how private U.S. companies collect and distribute orbit-based images of Earth. There are many companies launching satellites with special cameras to look back down at the Earth these days. Companies offer a variety of data products and services from such imagery – for instance, to <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/feature-articles/commercial-satellites-shed-light-small-scale-agriculture\">improve agricultural land use</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A second primary job of OSC is space advocacy. OSC works with the other U.S. government agencies that also have jurisdiction over commercial use of outer space to make the regulatory environment easier. This includes working with the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/space/licenses\">Federal Aviation Administration</a> on launch licensing, the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/policy-and-rules-division/general/radio-spectrum-allocation\">Federal Communications Commission</a> on radio wavelength usage and the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-and-guidance-information-topic-waste\">Environmental Protection Agency</a> on rules about the hazardous chemicals in rocket fuel.</p>\n\n<p>This job also includes coordinating with other countries that allow companies to launch satellites, collect data in orbit and offer space-based services. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024, for example, the OSC helped revise the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, one of the main documents restricting the shipping of advanced technologies out of the country. <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/23/2024-23932/export-administration-regulations-removal-of-license-requirements-for-certain-spacecraft-and-related\">This change</a> removed some limitations, allowing American companies to export certain types of spacecraft to three countries: Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>The OSC also coordinates commercial satellites’ flight paths in near-Earth space, which is its third and largest function. The Department of Defense <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/18th-space-control-squadron/\">keeps track</a> of thousands of objects in outer space and issues alerts when the probability of a collision gets high. In 2018, President Donald Trump issued <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-national-space-council-signing-space-policy-directive-3/\">Space Policy Directive-3</a>, which included tasking OSC to take this role over for nongovernment satellites – that is, those owned by companies, not NASA or the military. The Department od Defense wants out of the job of traffic management involving privately owned satellites, and Trump’s directive in 2018 started the process of handing off this task to OSC.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A rocket launching from a structure, with a plume of smoke beneath it.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696561/original/file-20251015-56-8tw1n1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">When companies launch satellites into orbit, as on this SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the OSC helps manage the satellites’ flight paths in orbit to avoid collisions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=spacex%20starlink&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/John Raoux</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To prevent satellites from colliding, OSC has been developing the <a href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/traffic-coordination-system-for-space-tracss/\">traffic coordination system for space</a>, known as TraCSS.

Progress on this has been slower than anticipated, though, and <a href=\"https://www.oversight.gov/reports/audit/noaas-office-space-commerce-efforts-provide-space-situational-awareness-services-have\">an audit in 2024</a> revealed that the plan is way behind schedule and perhaps still years away.</p>\n\n<h2>Elevating OSC</h2>\n\n<p>Deep in the text of Trump’s Aug. 13, 2025, executive order called <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\">Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry</a>, there’s a directive to elevate OSC to report directly to the office of the secretary of commerce. This would make OSC equivalent to its current overseer, NOAA, with respect to importance and priority within the Department of Commerce. It would give OSC higher stature in setting more of the rules regarding commercial use of space, and it would make space commerce more visible across the broader economy.</p>\n\n<p>So, why did Trump include this line about elevating OSC in his Aug. 13 executive order? </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An astronaut pointing a camera out a circular window in the International Space Station at a\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696781/original/file-20251016-66-zgaxm1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, Expedition 41 flight engineer, uses a still camera at a window in the cupola of the International Space Station as the SpaceX Dragon commercial cargo craft approaches the station on Sept. 23, 2014.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details/iss041e020816\">Alex Gerst/Johnson Space Center</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Back in 2018, Trump issued <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/space-policy-directive-2-streamlining-regulations-commercial-use-space/\">Space Policy Directive-2</a> during his first term, which included a task to create the Space Policy Advancing Commerce Enterprise Administration, or SPACE. SPACE would have been an entity reporting directly to the secretary of commerce. While it was proposed as a bill in the House of Representatives later that year, it never became law. </p>\n\n<p>The Aug. 13 executive order essentially directs the Department of Commerce to make this move now. Should the secretary of commerce enact the order, it would bypass the role of Congress in promoting OSC. The 60-day window that Trump placed in the executive order for making this change has closed, but with the government shutdown it is unclear whether the elevation of OSC might still occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Troubles for OSC</h2>\n\n<p>While all of this sounds good for promoting space as a place for commercial activity, OSC has been under stress in 2025. In February, the Department of Government Efficiency targeted NOAA for cuts, including <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-office-of-space-commerce-doge-cuts/\">firing eight people</a> from OSC. Because about half of the people working in OSC are contractors, this represented a 30% reduction of force. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The dome of the Congress building in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696564/original/file-20251015-66-mdk6q5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many space industry professionals have urged Congress to restore funding to the OSC, but its future remains uncertain.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=trump%20budget&amp;mediaType=photo\">AP Photo/J.

In July, space industry leaders <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5391185-space-industry-companies-congress-funding-space-commerce-office/\">urged Congress</a> to restore funding to OSC. </p>\n\n<p>The Aug. 13 executive order appeared to be good news for OSC. On Sept. 9, however, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Commerce requested <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-05/trump-claws-back-2025-funding-for-commercial-space-office\">a 40% rescission</a> to OSC’s fiscal year 2025 budget. </p>\n\n<p>Rescissions are “clawbacks” of funds already approved and appropriated by Congress. The promised funding is essentially put on hold. Once proposed by the president, rescissions have to be voted on by both chambers of Congress to be enacted. This must occur within 45 days, or before the end of the fiscal year, which was Sept. 30. </p>\n\n<p>This rescission request came so close to that deadline that Congress did not act to stop it. As a result, OSC lost this funding. The loss could mean additional cutbacks to staff and perhaps even a shrinking of its focus areas. </p>\n\n<p>Will OSC be elevated?

Above the expanse of unmarked graves loom a deserted auto shop, a power substation, a massive billboard. The bare ground of the cemetery is strewn with weeds.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, across the way sits <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/shockoe-hill/\">Shockoe Hill Cemetery</a>. Established in 1822, it remains a peaceful cemetery with grass, large trees and bright marble headstones. This cemetery was created for white Christians.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FFy5tMUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra\">I am an archaeologist</a> who studies how the past shapes public life. Several years ago, I wrote with colleagues about the legacies of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01320-4\">stolen human remains</a> of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us-museums-hold-the-remains-of-thousands-of-black-people-156558\">African Americans in museums</a>. During this time, I learned more about how African Americans often had to bury their dead in unsanctioned spaces that received few protections. </p>\n\n<p>As I dug into this history, what struck me the most was that the different treatment of African Americans in death paralleled their long mistreatment in life. Places like Shockoe have not been accidentally forgotten. </p>\n\n<p>Although its purpose has endured and graves survive, Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground, the largest burial ground for enslaved and free people of color in the United States, has witnessed <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/wp-content/uploads/Smith_DisappearingtheEnslaved.pdf\">deliberate acts of violence</a>. As the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/buildland.27.1.0017\">historian Ryan K. Smith writes</a>, Shockoe “was not, as some would say, abandoned – it was actively destroyed.” </p>\n\n<h2>African burying grounds found and lost</h2>\n\n<p>This issue of protecting Black cemeteries first came to popular attention in 1991, when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/afbg/index.htm\">African Burial Ground</a> in downtown New York City was rediscovered and nearly obliterated by a construction project. It was preserved only through the valiant efforts of African American leaders and scientists.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, similar threats to Black cemeteries and questions about preservation have been reported at the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-enslaved-grave-sites\">Whitney Plantation</a> in Louisiana, the <a href=\"https://www.friendsofmoseshall.org/\">Morningstar Tabernacle No. 88</a> in Maryland and a <a href=\"https://time.com/5735711/lost-florida-cemetery/\">rediscovered graveyard</a> in Florida, among <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/blog/locating-mapping-black-cemeteries\">many others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like these other cemeteries, the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground has long faced constant perils, from grave robbing to construction projects. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/06/one-womans-crusade-brings-attention-long-forgotten/\">Lenora McQueen</a>, whose ancestor <a href=\"https://www.phillytrib.com/news/wheres-kitty-cary-the-answer-unlocked-black-history-richmond-tried-to-hide/article_4d7e2eae-6c46-5643-a97f-8cd4ea142ba9.html\">Kitty Cary</a> was buried there in 1857, has been leading the effort to protect the cemetery. McQueen’s tireless work – like the efforts needed at any disregarded Black cemetery in the country – has ranged from collaborating with city officials to <a href=\"https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/2021/04/the-city-of-richmond-now-owns-2nd.html\">purchase part of the site</a>, establishing a <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/30/once-a-dead-end-a-richmond-cemetery-earns-new-respect/\">marker</a> and <a href=\"https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2023/jun/22/sacred-burial-site-be-marked-mural/\">mural</a>, and assembling a team to earn the burying ground the <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/2021/08/16/approaching-the-national-register-shockoe-hill/\">recognition of the National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12149/death-and-rebirth-southern-city\">Smith has detailed</a> how, ever since Richmond’s founding in the 1730s, people of European and African descent in the city lived divided lives. By the early 1800s, officials formalized different cemeteries for Richmond’s different ethnic and racial communities. </p>\n\n<p>A 1-acre cemetery for free Black people and another one for enslaved people were situated near the city poorhouse and gunpowder depot. Yet, these grounds were hallowed to the African American community. Burial rituals included long processions, biblical-inflected homilies, spirituals and public displays of grief. </p>\n\n<p>However, the violations of these graves were easy enough. The cemetery was neither fenced nor formally tended. In the 1830s, medical schools began <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/\">robbing the burying ground</a> for cadavers. At the close of the Civil War, retreating Confederates <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/landslide2021/locations/shockoe.html\">exploded the gunpowder magazine</a>, reportedly destroying a section of the cemetery.</p>\n\n<p>City officials formally <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">closed the cemetery</a> in 1879, and the site’s systematic destruction began, despite constant objections of Black residents. Road and construction projects <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/30/once-a-dead-end-a-richmond-cemetery-earns-new-respect/\">cut through the burial grounds</a>. An African American editor at the time <a href=\"https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/\">denounced</a> the “people who profited by the desecration of the burial ground … when graves were dug into, bones scattered, coffins exposed and the hearts of the surviving families made to bleed by the desecration of the remains of their loved ones.”</p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed, a railroad track and an elevated highway were built on portions of the cemetery. In 1960, Richmond city officials <a href=\"https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/2021/04/the-city-of-richmond-now-owns-2nd.html\">sold a portion of the burying ground</a> to Shell, and a gas station was built atop the remains of human beings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The struggle to preserve Shockoe</h2>\n\n<p>In 2011, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources conducted a survey to determine the <a href=\"https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Appendix_R-Attachment_R11_Architectural_Survey_GNSA-SAAM-BBHW_Segment.pdf\">eligibility of the deserted auto shop</a> for the National Register of Historic Places. It did not even consider the history of the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground beneath and around the building as part of the site’s evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>Six years later, McQueen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/27/richmond-shockoe-african-burying-ground/\">learned that her ancestor</a> was interred at the burying ground. Horrified by the cemetery’s state of disarray, she became its leading advocate. Eventually, McQueen put together a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Undoing_Things/7YNTEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=undoing+african+american+remains&amp;pg=PT227&amp;printsec=frontcover\">team of scholars and preservationists</a> to pursue their own study of the site’s eligibility for the national register. They found the cultural landscape – the traces of human activity that give a place its history and meaning – to be highly significant.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the site’s history of destruction was a vital record of the unequal treatment shown toward Black burying grounds in the U.S. The team formally pursued its own nomination to the National Register of Historic places.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/127-7231/\">Shockoe Hill Burying Ground Historic District</a> was successfully listed is on the national register.</p>\n\n<p>Even with this success, the threats continue. Being listed on the national register provides prestige, grant opportunities and reviews for federal projects, but few guaranteed protections. In the same year Shockoe was listed on the national register, <a href=\"https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/9-Digging-and-the-laying-of-utility-lines-3-7-22c.pdf\">utility lines were installed</a> in the area without consulting heritage officials. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landslide-update-shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">high-speed rail project</a>, if implemented as planned, could violate the cemetery’s historical landscape. <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/questions-raised-new-memorial-design-proposals-shockoe-hill-african-burying-ground\">Designs for a memorial</a>, while well intentioned, might further harm the site and threaten its national register status if it is not treated as a cemetery with graves.</p>\n\n<p>What the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground reveals is the need for the U.S. to provide dignity to all its citizens, in life and in death. A cemetery does not need famous inhabitants or marble tombstones to be significant. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/black-indigenous-archaeology-unmarked-graves/\">McQueen has said</a> of her ancestor’s eternal resting ground, “Burial spaces are sacred.”</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264864/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I have sat in on some meetings about the burial ground&#39;s preservation as a heritage expert, at the request of the descendant Lenora McQueen.</span></em></p>",

As the bot serves up practical suggestions and encouragement, insights come more easily, drafts polish up quickly and feedback loops feel immediate. It can be energizing. But when that AI support is removed, some students <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbah.2025.100181\">report feeling less confident or less willing to engage</a>. </p>\n\n<p>These outcomes raise the question: Can AI tools genuinely boost student motivation? And what conditions can make or break that boost?</p>\n\n<p>As AI tools become more common in classroom settings, the answers to these questions matter a lot. While tools for general use such as ChatPGT or Claude remain popular, more and more students are encountering AI tools that are purpose-built to support learning, such as Khan Academy’s Khanmigo, which personalizes lessons. Others, such as ALEKS, provide adaptive feedback. Both tools adjust to a learner’s level and highlight progress over time, which helps students feel capable and see improvement. But there are still many unknowns about the long-term effects of these tools on learners’ progress, an issue I continue to study as an educational psychologist.</p>\n\n<h2>What the evidence shows so far</h2>\n\n<p>Recent studies indicate that AI can boost motivation, at least for certain groups, when deployed under the right conditions. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-08697-6\">2025 experiment with university students</a> showed that when AI tools delivered a high-quality performance and allowed meaningful interaction, students’ motivation and their confidence in being able to complete a task – known as self-efficacy – increased. </p>\n\n<p>For foreign language learners, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-04878-w\">a 2025 study</a> found that university students using AI-driven personalized systems took more pleasure in learning and had less anxiety and more self-efficacy compared with those using traditional methods. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10755-024-09747-z\">A recent cross-cultural analysis</a> with participants from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Poland who were studying diverse majors suggested that positive motivational effects are strongest when tools prioritize autonomy, self-direction and critical thinking. These individual findings align with a broader, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2025.100455\">systematic review of generative AI tools</a> that found positive effects on student motivation and engagement across cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NYDZ4\">A forthcoming meta-analysis</a> from my team at the University of Alabama, which synthesized 71 studies, echoed these patterns. We found that generative AI tools on average produce moderate positive effects on motivation and engagement. The impact is larger when tools are used consistently over time rather than in one-off trials. Positive effects were also seen when teachers provide scaffolding, when students maintain agency in how they use the tool, and when the output quality is reliable. </p>\n\n<p>But there are caveats. More than 50 of the studies we reviewed did not draw on a clear theoretical framework of motivation, and some used methods that we found were weak or inappropriate. This raises concerns about the quality of the evidence and underscores how much more careful research is needed before one can say with confidence that AI nurtures students’ intrinsic motivation rather than just making tasks easier in the moment.</p>\n\n<h2>When AI backfires</h2>\n\n<p>There is also research that paints a more sobering picture. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-98385-2\">A large study</a> of more than 3,500 participants found that while human–AI collaboration improved task performance, it reduced intrinsic motivation once the AI was removed. Students reported more boredom and less satisfaction, suggesting that overreliance on AI can erode confidence in their own abilities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/07356331251329185\">Another study</a> suggested that while learning achievement often rises with the use of AI tools, increases in motivation are smaller, inconsistent or short-lived. Quality matters as much as quantity. When AI delivers inaccurate results, or when students feel they have little control over how it is used, motivation quickly erodes. Confidence drops, engagement fades and students can begin to see the tool as a crutch rather than a support. And because there are not many long-term studies in this field, we still do not know whether AI can truly sustain motivation over time, or whether its benefits fade once the novelty wears off.</p>\n\n<h2>Not all AI tools work the same way</h2>\n\n<p>The impact of AI on student motivation is not one-size-fits-all. Our team’s meta-analysis shows that, on average, AI tools do have a positive effect, but the size of that effect depends on how and where they are used. When students work with AI regularly over time, when teachers guide them in using it thoughtfully, and when students feel in control of the process, the motivational benefits are much stronger. </p>\n\n<p>We also saw differences across settings. College students seemed to gain more than younger learners, STEM and writing courses tended to benefit more than other subjects, and tools designed to give feedback or tutoring support outperformed those that simply generated content. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young student working on tablet at school.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697554/original/file-20251021-56-tzb4o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Specialized AI-based tools designed for learning tend to work better for students with proper teacher support compared to general-purpose chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude. But those specialized products typically cost money, raising questions over equity and quality of education.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/home/search?query=Education%20classroom%20students&amp;mediaType=photo\">Charlie Riedel/AP</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>There is also evidence that general-use tools like ChatGPT or Claude do not reliably promote intrinsic motivation or deeper engagement with content, compared to learning-specific platforms such as ALEKS and Khanmigo, which are more effective at supporting persistence and self-efficacy. However, these tools often come with subscription or licensing costs. This raises questions of equity, since the students who could benefit most from motivational support may also be the least likely to afford it.</p>\n\n<p>These and other recent findings should be seen as only a starting point. Because AI is so new and is changing so quickly, what we know today may not hold true tomorrow. In a paper titled <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20965311251367053\">The Death and Rebirth of Research in Education in the Age of AI</a>, the authors argue that the speed of technological change makes traditional studies outdated before they are even published. At the same time, AI opens the door to new ways of studying learning that are more participatory, flexible and imaginative. Taken together, the data and the critiques point to the same lesson: Context, quality and agency matter just as much as the technology itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters for all of us</h2>\n\n<p>The lessons from this growing body of research are straightforward. The presence of AI does not guarantee higher motivation, but it can make a difference if tools are designed and used with care and understanding of students’ needs. When it is used thoughtfully, in ways that strengthen students’ sense of competence, autonomy and connection to others, it can be a powerful ally in learning. </p>\n\n<p>But without those safeguards, the short-term boost in performance could come at a steep cost. Over time, there is the risk of weakening the very qualities that matter most – motivation, persistence, critical thinking and the uniquely human capacities that no machine can replace.</p>\n\n<p>For teachers, this means that while AI may prove a useful partner in learning, it should never serve as a stand-in for genuine instruction. For parents, it means paying attention to how children use AI at home, noticing whether they are exploring, practicing and building skills or simply leaning on it to finish tasks. For policymakers and technology developers, it means creating systems that support student agency, provide reliable feedback and avoid encouraging overreliance. And for students themselves, it is a reminder that AI can be a tool for growth, but only when <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-does-ai-affect-how-we-learn-a-cognitive-psychologist-explains-why-you-learn-when-the-work-is-hard-262863\">paired with their own effort</a> and curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of technology, students need to feel capable, autonomous and connected. Without these basic psychological needs in place, their sense of motivation will falter – with or without AI.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264728/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Yurou Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Even though comprehensive research since January 2025 is still emerging, early findings already suggest a further narrowing of what feels safe to say.</p>\n\n<p>One-third of faculty reported in January that they feel they have less freedom to express their views, reflecting an environment in which faculty members’ <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/faculty-report-declining-academic-freedom\">voices are increasingly constrained</a> </p>\n\n<p>Faculty I spoke with over the past few months described “navigating sensitive boundaries” in their lectures, avoiding having any discussion about race, gender and religion. They also talked about not using terms like <a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-dei\">diversity, equity and inclusion</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Watching what you say</h2>\n\n<p>For professors on <a href=\"https://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/contingent-contract/\">contingent contracts</a> – meaning they are not on a track to <a href=\"https://academicpositions.com/career-advice/what-is-tenure\">receive tenure</a>, a secure work position that typically lasts a lifetime – the fear is heightened. The same is true for other faculty members like <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/education/adjunct-teaching\">adjunct professors</a>, who depend on short-term or renewable contracts. </p>\n\n<p>Without the protection of tenure, even a single complaint or potential controversy can jeopardize a professor’s position – and recent cases of tenured professors suggest that even tenure no longer offers the same <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/18/tenure-college-faculty-republican-challenges/\">level of security it once did</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One adjunct professor put it bluntly: “When your next contract depends on staying in bounds, watching what you say is survival.” </p>\n\n<p>For many instructors, the need to continually reassess how a comment, reading or assignment might be received changes the experience of teaching in subtle but meaningful ways.</p>\n\n<p>Faculty members I spoke with described heightened anxiety, sleepless nights and a persistent fear that a misstep could derail their careers. This psychological strain, compounded by workload and financial stress, leaves little space for creativity, innovation or joy in teaching.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white photo of an older man wearing a blazer has different-colored squiggle lines coming out from his head, forming a cloudlike shape above him\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=700&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697573/original/file-20251021-66-xkep6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Many faculty members report that they are increasingly self-censoring in order to avoid potential controversy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/contemporary-art-collage-old-man-in-retro-suit-royalty-free-image/1423584992?phrase=faculty%20mental%20health&amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;adppopup=true\">master1350/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The downstream effects on students</h2>\n\n<p>Faculty members’ well-being is inseparable from how students experience college.

Instead, sloth teeth are made primarily of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2741/E281\">dentin</a>, a more porous and organic-rich tissue that readily changes its chemical composition with fossilization. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/38229\">Stable isotope analyses</a> are less dependable in sloths because dentin’s chemical composition <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.02.021\">can be altered</a> postmortem, skewing the isotopic signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique researchers use to glean information about an animal’s diet relies on analyzing the microscopic wear patterns on its teeth. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/2051-672X/4/2/023002\">Dental microwear texture analysis</a> can infer whether an animal mostly ate tough foods such as leaves and grass or hard foods such as seeds and fruit pits. This technique is also tricky when it comes to sloths’ fossilized teeth because signs of wear may be preserved differently in the softer dentin than in harder enamel.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to studying fossil sloths, we vetted <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1644/12-MAMM-A-204.1\">dental microwear methods in modern xenarthrans</a>, a group of animals that includes sloths, armadillos and anteaters. This study demonstrated that dentin microwear can reveal dietary differences between leaf-eating sloths and insect-consuming armadillos, giving us confidence that these tools could reveal dietary information from ground sloth fossils.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinct dietary niches revealed</h2>\n\n<p>Previous research suggested that giant ground sloths were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.58782/flmnh.tdzu5337\">either grass-eating grazers or leaf-eating browsers</a>, based on the size and shape of their teeth. However, more direct measures of diet – such as stable isotopes or dental microwear – were often lacking. </p>\n\n<p>Our new analyses revealed contrasting dental wear signatures between the two co-occurring ground sloth species. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/learn/nature/ground-sloth.htm\">Harlan’s ground sloth</a>, the larger of the two, had microwear patterns dominated by deep pitlike textures. This kind of wear is indicative of chewing hard, mechanically challenging foods such as tubers, seeds, fungi and fruit pits. Our new evidence aligns with skeletal adaptations that suggest powerful digging abilities, consistent with foraging foods both above and below ground.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"diagram of sloth profiles, tooth outline and magnified surface of two bits of the teeth\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697541/original/file-20251021-56-ucrk3z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=553&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The fossil teeth of the Harlan’s ground sloth typically showed deeper pitlike textures, bottom, while the Shasta ground sloth teeth had shallower wear patterns, top.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2025.0158\">DeSantis and Kurre, Biology Letters 2025</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/giant-ground-sloths.htm\">Shasta ground sloth</a> exhibited dental microwear textures more akin to those in leaf-eating and woody plant-eating herbivores. This pattern corroborates previous studies of its fossilized dung, demonstrating a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.402\">diet rich in desert plants</a> such as yucca, agave and saltbush.  </p>\n\n<p>Next we compared the sloths’ <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.11.019\">microwear textures to those of ungulates</a> such as camels, horses and bison that lived in the same region of Southern California. We confirmed that neither sloth species’ dietary behavior overlapped fully with other herbivores. Giant ground sloths didn’t perform the same ecological functions as the other herbivores that shared their landscape. Instead, both ground sloths partitioned their niches and played complementary ecological roles.</p>\n\n<h2>Extinctions brought ecological loss</h2>\n\n<p>The Harlan’s ground sloth was a megafaunal ecosystem engineer. It excavated soil and foraged underground, thereby affecting soil structure and nutrient cycling, even dispersing seed and fungal spores over wide areas. <a href=\"https://arboretum.harvard.edu/arnoldia-stories/anachronistic-fruits-and-the-ghosts-who-haunt-them/\">Anecdotal evidence</a> suggests that some anachronistic fruits – such as the weird, bumpy-textured and softball-size <a href=\"https://www.earth.com/news/osage-orange-megafauna-extinction/\">Osage orange</a> – were dispersed by ancient megafauna such as giant ground sloths. When the Pleistocene megafauna went extinct, the loss contributed to the regional restriction of these plants, since no one was around to spread their seeds.</p>\n\n<p>The broader consequence is clear: Megafaunal extinctions erased critical ecosystem engineers, triggering cascading ecological changes that continue to affect habitat resilience today. Our results resonate with growing evidence that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.04.024\">preserving today’s living large herbivores</a> and understanding the diversity of their ecological niches is crucial for conserving functional ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Studying the teeth of lost giant ground sloths has illuminated not only their diets but also the enduring ecological legacies of their extinction. Today’s sloths, though charming, only hint at the profound environmental influence of their prehistoric relatives – giants that shaped landscapes in ways we are only beginning to appreciate.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267601/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Larisa R.

Their language was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811987116\">neutral and polished, laced with political jargon</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While populist political communication has become more common <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522\">along with the proliferation of social media</a>, the communication norms are further altered in Trump White House social media posts. </p>\n\n<p>They are partisan, theatrical and exaggerated. Their tone is almost circuslike. The process of governing is portrayed as a reality TV show, in which political roles are performed with little regard for real-world consequences. Vivid color schemes and stylized imagery convert political messaging into visual spectacle. The language is colloquial, down-to-earth. </p>\n\n<p>Just as other influencers in a variety of domains might create an emotional bond by tailoring <a href=\"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/18175/3702\">social media</a> messages, content, products and services to the needs and likes of individual customers, the White House tailors its content to the beliefs, language and worldview of Trump’s political base.</p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1918502592335724809&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>In doing so, the White House echoes a broad, growing trend in <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1177/13548565241260486\">political communication</a>, portraying Trump as “a champion of the people” and using direct and informal communication that appeals to fear and resentment.  </p>\n\n<p>Trump White House social media makes no effort to promote social unity or constructive dialogue, or reduce polarization – and often heightens it. Undocumented immigrants, for example, are often portrayed as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/the-snake-poem/\">inherently evil</a>. White House social media amplifies dramatic, emotionally charged content. </p>\n\n<p>In one video, Trump recites a poem about <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/the-snake-poem/\">a kind woman who takes in a snake</a>, a stand-in for an immigrant who in reality is a dangerous serpent. “Instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite,” Trump recites.</p>\n\n<h2>Talking to the base</h2>\n\n<p>While some scholars have called the White House social media style “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323116682802\">amateurish</a>,” that hasn’t resulted in change. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of response to negative feedback is partially explained by the strategic goal of these communications: to appeal to the frustrations of Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-billionaire-candidate-and-his-blue-collar-following/432783/\">deeply disaffected political base</a>, which seems to revel in the White House social media style. </p>\n\n<p><div data-react-class=\"Tweet\" data-react-props=\"{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1965179520761364626&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;conversation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}}\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Scholars <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/precariat-9780755637072/\">identify a large number of these voters as “the precariat</a>,” a group whose once-stable, union-protected jobs have been outsourced or replaced with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000022\">low-wage, insecure service work</a>.

One example: A White House Valentine’s Day communication that said “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/style/white-house-deportation-memes.html\">and we’ll deport you</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Trump and the White House social media use the president’s status as a celebrity, coupled with comedy and spectacle, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14318/hau6.2.009\">to immunize the administration from fallout</a>, even among some of its critics. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s exaggerated gestures, over-the-top language, his lampooning of opponents and his use of caricature to ridicule whole categories of people – including <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/29/congress/trump-ai-video-deepfake-schumer-jeffries-00586048\">Democrats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/video/2017/01/donald-trump-mocks-disabled-reporter-061897\">the disabled</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/15/short-history-president-trumps-anti-muslim-bigotry/\">Muslims</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer\">Mexicans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-worst-offensive-comments-quotes/\">women</a> – is read by his political base as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/style/trump-officials-social-media.html\">playful and entertaining take down</a> of political correctness. It may form a sturdy pillar of his support. </p>\n\n<p>But prioritizing entertainment over facts has long-term significance. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s communication strategies are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-following-trumps-pre-election-playbook-177863\">already setting a global precedent</a>, encouraging other politicians to adopt similar theatrical and polarizing tactics that distort or deny facts. </p>\n\n<p>These methods may energize some audiences but risk alienating others. Informed political engagement is reduced, and democratic backsliding is increasingly a reality.</p>\n\n<p>Although the communication style of the White House is playful and irreverent, it has a serious goal: the diffusion of ideological messages whose intent is to create a sense of strength and righteousness among its supporters. </p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, this is propaganda designed to persuade citizens that the government is strong, its enemies evil and that fellow citizens – “real Americans” – think the same way. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43664158\">Scholars observe that</a> the White House projection of the often comical images of authority echoes the visual style of authoritarian governments. Both seek to be seen as in control of the social and political order and thereby to discourage dissent. </p>\n\n<p>The chief difference between the two is that in a deeply polarized democracy such as the U.S., citizens interpret these displays of authority in sharply different ways: They build <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S153759272400272X\">opposition among Trump opponents</a> but support among supporters. </p>\n\n<p>The rising intolerance that results erodes social cohesion, undermines support for democratic norms and weakens trust in institutions. And that opens the door to democratic backsliding.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259950/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Everything else – including the broad “police power” to regulate health, safety, morals and general welfare – <a href=\"https://www.jackmillercenter.org/our-work/resources/tenth-amendment\">remained with the states</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet from the beginning, the text has generated plenty of confusion. Is the 10th Amendment merely a “<a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep312/usrep312100/usrep312100.pdf\">truism</a>,” as Justice Harlan Fiske Stone wrote in 1941 in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/312us100\">United States v. Darby</a>, restating the Constitution’s structure of limited powers? Or does it describe concrete powers held by the states?</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, there’s no simple answer, not even from the nation’s highest court. Over the years, the Supreme Court has treated the 10th Amendment like the proverbial magician’s hat, sometimes pulling robust state powers from its depths, other times finding it empty.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The roofline with carvings on it of a large, white, pillared building.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697387/original/file-20251020-56-2c84ai.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Will the Supreme Court justices weigh in on the Trump administration’s attempts to deploy the National Guard?</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-u-s-supreme-court-is-shown-march-17-2025-in-washington-news-photo/2205530289?adppopup=true\">Win McNamee/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>10th Amendment’s broad range</h2>\n\n<p>The arguments over the 10th Amendment for almost 200 years have applied not only to the National Guard but to questions about how the federal and state governments share powers over everything from taxation to government salaries, law enforcement and regulation of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>For much of the 19th century, the 10th Amendment remained dormant. The federal government’s weakness and limited ambitions, especially on the slavery question, meant that boundaries were <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt10-3-1/ALDE_00013621/\">rarely tested before the courts</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The New Deal era brought this equilibrium crashing down. </p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court initially resisted the expansion of federal power, striking down laws banning child labor in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/247us251\">Hammer v. Dagenhart</a> in 1918, setting a federal minimum wage in 1923 in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/261us525\">Adkins v. Children’s Hospital</a>, and offering farmers subsidies in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/297us1\">U.S. v. Butler</a> in 1937. All these decisions were based on the 10th Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>But this resistance wore down in the face of economic crisis and political pressure. By the time of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/312us100\">the Darby case in 1941</a>, which concerned the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938\">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> and Congress’ power to regulate many aspects of employment, the court had relegated the 10th Amendment to “truism” status: The Amendment, wrote Stone, did nothing more than restate the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment.</p>\n\n<p>The 1970s marked an unexpected revival. In the 1976 decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1974/74-878\">National League of Cities v. Usery</a>, a dispute over whether Congress could directly exercise control over minimum wage and overtime pay for state and local government employees, the court held that Congress could not use its commerce power to regulate state governments. </p>\n\n<p>But that principle was abandoned nine years later, with the court <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1913\">doubling back on its position</a>. Now, if the states wanted protection from federal overreach, they would have to seek it through the political process, not judicial intervention. </p>\n\n<p>Yet less than a decade later, the court reversed course again. The modern federalism renaissance began in the ’90s with a <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-543\">pair</a> of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-543\">divided opinions</a> stating that the federal government cannot force the states to enforce federal regulatory programs: this was the “anti-commandeering principle.” </p>\n\n<h2>The 10th Amendment’s meandering path</h2>\n\n<p>In recent decades, the court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, has invoked the amendment to protect state power in varied, even surprising contexts: states’ entitlement to <a href=\"https://healthlaw.org/resource/the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-acas-medicaid-expansion-qa/\">federal Medicaid spending</a>; state <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.36644/mlr.114.7.inventing\">authority over running elections</a>, despite patterns of voter exclusion; even <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10133\">legalization of sports gambling</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in 2024, Colorado was barred by the court from <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/trump-v-anderson-2/\">excluding Trump from the presidential ballot</a> as part of its power to administer elections.</p>\n\n<p>That brings us back to the present, where Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/chicago-portland-trump-national-guard-deployments-court-hearings-rcna236201\">bids to send them to Portland and Chicago</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>From the point of view of federalism, two factors lend this conflict some constitutional complexity.</p>\n\n<p>One is the National Guard’s dual state-federal character. Most Guard mobilizations, including disaster relief, take place under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32\">Title 32 of the U.S. Code</a>, which maintains state control of troops with federal funding. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section12406&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\">Title 10</a> allows the president to assert federal control over Guard units in case of “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406\">a rebellion or danger of a rebellion</a>” against the government or where “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”</p>\n\n<p>The other factor is political. </p>\n\n<p>Since World War II, the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/national-guard-troops-uses.html\">has been deployed only 10 times</a> by presidents, mostly in support of racial desegregation and the protection of civil rights. All but one of these mobilizations came at the governor’s request – the lone exception, pre-Trump, being President Dwight Eisenhower’s 1957 mobilization of <a href=\"https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/civil-rights-little-rock-school-integration-crisis\">the Arkansas National Guard to desegregate schools</a> in Little Rock over the wishes of Gov. Orval Faubus. </p>\n\n<p>In sharp contrast, Trump has now attempted three times to send troops to large cities over the explicit objection of Democratic governors. Such is the case in Portland. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A man with sandy hair dressed in a blue jacket, white shirt and red tie.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697386/original/file-20251020-56-nlywwi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">President Donald Trump has faced lawsuits when deploying the National Guard to states with Democratic governors.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TrumpUSAustralia/a8c1fb4959fa4b8aad38f5e86234e141/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Evan Vucci</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>National Guard deployments and constitutional stakes</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/28/oregon-sues-block-trump-national-guard-portland-00583937\">Oregon’s lawsuit</a> argues that there is no national emergency in the city, and that deploying Guard troops to the state without Gov.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, maps were <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/26325\">central to the ethnic cleansing</a> that took place in the early 1990s, driving visions of creating mono-ethnic space through violence, and also to the ending of the war. Similarly, in the Caucasus, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Near-Abroad-Contest-Ukraine-Caucasus/dp/0190253304\">cartographic fantasies of homogeneous territories</a> have underwritten campaigns against ethnic others in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>\n\n<p>And it is no surprise that maps are a critical part of negotiations now to end the 3½-year conflict in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<h2>Creative cartography</h2>\n\n<p>Drawing partition lines on maps has always been a feature of stalemated territorial conflicts. U.S. negotiators in 1995 <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/bih/126173\">forged the agreement</a> that brought Bosnia’s war to an end through last-minute cartographic adjustments ensuring that the settlement conformed to an already agreed-upon <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bosnia_Remade/y2ReAwAAQBAJ?hl=en\">49-51 percentage split of the territory</a> between Bosnian-Serb forces and those representing the Bosnian Federation.</p>\n\n<p>Dividing territory in percentage terms, however, goes against the grain of how most people view their territorial homelands. In his famous account of <a href=\"https://ia601200.us.archive.org/25/items/benedict-anderson-imagined-communities/Benedict-Anderson-Imagined%20Communities.pdf\">nations as “imagined communities</a>,” the Anglo-Irish historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/01/benedict-anderson\">Benedict Anderson</a> described how states create nations through the widespread circulation of a common territorial map. In this way, map images became a type of state logo. Nations not only imagined themselves as a community but as belonging to a particular recognizable space, a familiar territorial homeland.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Two people take a selfie in front of an outline of a map made with flowers.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=435&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697502/original/file-20251021-56-xr0e1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A decorative map of Ukraine made with flowers in Kyiv on Aug. 23, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/couple-makes-selfie-at-a-decorative-map-of-ukraine-made-news-photo/2230751661?adppopup=true\">Sergei SupinskyAFP via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Territories in today’s world have become instantly recognizable shapes on posters and T-shirts and in textbooks. Yet they are also experienced as something alive and personal – a “<a href=\"https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/siam-mapped-a-history-of-the-geo-body-of-a-nation/\">geo-body</a>,” in the words of Thai historian Thongchai Winichakul.</p>\n\n<p>It is part of what leads citizens, and nations, to feel deeply connected to their state’s territorial boundaries. And it helps explain the generally persistent resistance of Ukrainians to territorial concessions to Russia – even though there are signs that popular <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2025.2538481\">sentiment is beginning to shift</a> after 3½ years of war.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting and dying for a homeland, as Ukrainian soldiers have done in their thousands, adds to the emotive power of territory. To many Ukrainians it isn’t property they are being asked to concede but sacred and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/indivisibleterri0000godd/page/n5/mode/2up\">indivisible land</a> paid for with blood.</p>\n\n<p>This understanding of territory is quite different from that of Trump and his handpicked cadre of “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/jared-kushner-gaza-deal.html\">deal guys</a>” who treat international conflict like short-term business transactions.</p>\n\n<h2>Misreading the map</h2>\n\n<p>This pursuit of a deal over other considerations has a downside and can lead to missteps. Trump’s special envoy for peace missions, Steve Witkoff, believed he had achieved something of a breakthrough during a meeting with the Russians in early August when looking at areas where Russia might withdraw on the map. German newspaper Bild reported that Witkoff, who does not speak Russian and didn’t have his own translator, <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland-und-internationales/friedlicher-rueckzug-hat-trumps-mann-putin-falsch-verstanden-6895de301174f91cb081eb54\">misunderstood Putin’s demand</a> of a “peaceful withdrawal” of Ukrainians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as an offer of Russia’s “peaceful withdrawal” from those regions.</p>\n\n<p>Because it led to the postponement of new U.S. sanctions and a summit proposal, the Russians went along with the misunderstanding, according to the Bild’s reporting.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the subsequent Alaska summit was not the breakthrough Trump envisioned. Putin got the red-carpet treatment on U.S. soil but nonetheless subjected Trump to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7af3b49e-c4da-405b-8199-3e12957b78c2\">a lengthy historical lecture on why Russia owns Ukraine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Putin was unwilling to give Trump the ceasefire deal the U.S. president desired. Putin did, however, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putins-demand-ukraine-give-up-donbas-no-nato-no-western-troops-sources-say-2025-08-21/\">make a territorial proposal</a> that kept Trump interested in continuing to play the peacemaker: If Russia acquired all of the territory of the two oblasts that made up the Donbas, then Russia would consider freezing its lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p>\n\n<h2>Haggling over percentiles</h2>\n\n<p>This provided the background for an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/18/us/trump-zelensky-ukraine-putin\">extraordinary meeting in the White House</a> on Aug. 18, 2025, when seven European leaders joined Zelenskyy in meeting Trump to discuss a possible endgame to the war. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian delegation was <a href=\"https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/08/18/1609568.html\">pictured entering the White House </a> with what looked like a rolled-up map. In the Oval Office, however, they were confronted with the White House’s own <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeynw8jppdo\">rigid board depicting a map of the “Russia-Ukraine Conflict</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>It featured a <a href=\"https://data.europa.eu/apps/data-visualisation-guide/choropleth-maps\">choropleth display</a> with the estimated territory under Russian occupation colored in orange and quantified as a percentage figure of each oblast’s territory. The map indicated that Russia occupied 99% of Luhansk and 76% of Donetsk. Putin wanted 100% of both – a demand that required Ukraine to surrender the fortified territories safeguarding central Ukraine.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A map is shown in front of a bust and various people.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=300&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697498/original/file-20251021-56-thjh4a.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=377&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A close-up of the White House map showing percentiles over various Ukrainian regions.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/p20250818dt-2178_54732163195_o_fb8a69.jpg\">The White House</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>What the Oval Office map meant to Trump was clear the following day in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kKnpQpKI-oE?si=hQvjW0JujfIu2bGK\">phone interview on “Fox and Friends</a>.” Referring to the map, he said that a “big chunk of territory is taken,” implying it is now lost to Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the map recorded the score in real estate terms from a regrettable war between a small state and a much larger one. </p>\n\n<p>Zelenskyy tried to argue for a different approach to map issues, one that affirmed the symbolic and strategic importance of keeping Ukraine’s territorial integrity alive as an ideal for Ukrainians and the international community. </p>\n\n<p>He made some progress. After meeting Zelenskyy at the United Nations on Sept. 23, Trump suggested that Ukraine could succeed in its fight to “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine.html\">take back their country in its original form</a>.”</p>\n\n<h2>Battlegrounds as real estate</h2>\n\n<p>With Trump seemingly drifting toward supporting Ukraine with long-range missiles, Putin seized the initiative by phoning Trump. In an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-putin-cease-fire-ukraine.html\">extensive phone call</a> prior to Zelenskyy’s White House visit on Oct. 17, the Russian leader updated his offer for peace, suggesting his forces would withdraw from Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in return for all of the Donbas region. </p>\n\n<p>This set the stage for the latest reported Trump-Zelenskyy shouting match and the tossing aside of front-line maps. </p>\n\n<p>Afterward, <a href=\"https://www.trumpstruth.org/statuses/33340\">Trump posted on social media</a>: “… it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are.” </p>\n\n<p>This is Trump’s current position on map issues. Backing off pressuring Ukraine to give up all the Donbas in public, he believes that Ukraine and the Donbas should be “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-gas-strikes-energy-50826ce7b96814ad943d8721c1a2915c\">cut up” along the current battlelines</a>. Asked in a Fox News <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/11485009/trump-ukraine-potential-land-exchange-russia-peace/\">interview on Oct. 6</a> whether Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he’s going to take something. They fought and he has a lot of property. He’s won certain property.”</p>\n\n<p>This gets at how Zelenskyy and Trump seemingly see different things when they look at front-line maps. The Ukrainian leader sees a painful reality, his country’s geo-body violently cut apart by an invading, occupying power. Trump comments indicate he sees it as a property dispute in which the strongest power has accumulated some territorial winnings and now needs to cash them in.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265798/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Gerard Toal in the past received funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Research Council of Norway. </span></em></p>",

The study of gender represents the kind of free inquiry that allows people to decide for themselves how to live, free of coercion or government control. </p>\n\n<h2>What is ‘gender ideology’?</h2>\n\n<p>“Gender ideology” is a catch-all term <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2017/12/11/gender-ideology-tracking-its-origins-and-meanings-in-current-gender-politics/\">conservative Catholics initially promoted in the 1990s</a> in response to the United Nations’ promotion of women’s equality. </p>\n\n<p>In 2004, pushing back on the global women’s and gay rights movements, the Vatican declared in a <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040731_collaboration_en.html\">letter to bishops</a> that men and women are different by nature “not only on the physical level, but also on the psychological and spiritual.” The letter stated that the idea of gender “inspired ideologies” that sanction alternatives to the traditional two-parent family headed by men and treated homosexuality on par with heterosexuality.</p>\n\n<p>Over the following decades, evangelical groups and far-right parties across the globe – from <a href=\"https://politicalcapital.hu/news.php?article_read=1&amp;article_id=3037\">Hungary</a> and <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/rag/15/2/article-p113_1.xml\">Russia</a> to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X20000070\">Peru</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2024/02/06/anti-gender-ideology-and-neo-liberal-state-grammar-in-brazil/\">Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/2024/02/27/who-is-afraid-of-gender-study-on-gender-ideology-and-the-anti-gender-campaigns-that-support-it-in-burkina-faso-ghana-and-senegal/\">Ghana</a> – have used the language of combating “gender ideology” to counter a host of social policies, including sex education in schools, the legalization of gay marriage and same-sex adoption, reproductive rights and transgender rights. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Crowd of people, center of which is a sign depicting silhouette figures of a man and a woman holding an umbrella shielding two children from a rainbow\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=406&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697018/original/file-20251017-66-ofplbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=510&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Anti-gender protestors during a 2018 Equality March in Kraków, Poland.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:02018_Nationalists,_anti-gay_protesters_during_the_%22Equality_March%22_in_Krak%C3%B3w.jpg\">Silar/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/asequals/anti-gender-equality-threat-explained-as-equals-intl-cmd/\">anti-gender movement</a> is no longer fringe but rather <a href=\"https://untoday.org/backlash-unfiltered-pushing-equality-forwards/\">well funded, organized and transnational</a>. For example, 40 countries have signed the <a href=\"https://womenshealth.gov/geneva-consensus-declaration\">Geneva Consensus Declaration</a>, an international pact proposed by the first Trump administration and supported by anti-gender campaigners as a way to <a href=\"https://fosfeminista.org/news-and-stories/beyond-the-global-gag-rule/\">deny abortion rights internationally</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., where the majority of Americans <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/646202/sex-relations-marriage-supported.aspx\">support gay marriage</a> <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx\">and abortion rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html\">targeting trans rights</a> has become one of the conservative movement’s galvanizing issues. A <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country\">flood of state bills</a> not only ban books and discussions of gender, sexuality and race in schools but also criminalize abortion, ban gender-affirming health care and legalize discrimination in housing and employment on religious grounds. </p>\n\n<h2>What we talk about when we talk about gender</h2>\n\n<p>How gender is researched and taught in universities <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/europe-far-right-target-gender-studies/591208/\">has become</a> <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2024/04/05/more-students-take-gender-studies-even-it-comes-under-attack\">a key target</a> of anti-gender campaigns across the globe, in part because the study of gender raises questions about the universality of traditional social roles and the inequalities that can result from them.</p>\n\n<p>Gender is a focus of inquiry not only in gender studies classes but in literature, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/home/GAS\">sociology</a>, <a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/academics/journals/journal-gender-and-law\">law</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-gender\">government</a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680424\">history</a>, anthropology and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/cgpc20\">cultural geography</a>, among <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/what-gender-studies-is-and-how-to-use-the-degree\">many other fields</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/7303210/religious-opposition-trans-healthcare-new/\">Anti-gender campaigners argue</a> there is nothing to understand about it because gender is given by nature or God. For them, gender is equivalent to sex, which is taken to be straightforward and without exception male or female.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific evidence suggests, however, that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/are-trans-women-biologically-male-the-answer-is-complicated-244465\">sex is not always binary</a>. In biology, sex refers to genes, reproductive organs, hormone systems and observable physical characteristics; different combinations of these lead to variations in sex. Far from straightforward, then, sex is complicated. </p>\n\n<p>And a person’s assigned sex at birth does not always align with their deeply held sense of self – their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/genetic-testing-cannot-reveal-the-gender-of-your-baby-two-genetic-counselors-explain-the-complexities-of-sex-and-gender-217631\">gender identity</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Gender is both a feature of individual people and a <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/ccf/2019/04/30/gender-structures-every-aspect-of-life/\">mode of organizing social life</a>. At the individual level, people have a subjective sense of and embody their gender by dressing and behaving in ways that encourage other people to see them as they want to be seen. A man might wear a tie at the office to convey masculinity. People will interact differently with a woman when she is wearing high heels and makeup than when she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/style/pamela-anderson-no-makeup-vanity-fair.html\">goes barefaced</a> or dons <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019343453/women-sports-sexualization-uniforms-problem\">a swimsuit</a>. Someone who is <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gender-fluidity-what-it-means-and-why-support-matters-2020120321544\">gender fluid</a> may appear more masculine or feminine at different times and experience prejudice and discrimination. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/swSy6pdAS-0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Gender roles shape society and culture in both subtle and glaring ways.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Gender <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/ccf/2019/04/30/gender-structures-every-aspect-of-life/\">shapes societies</a> through norms and rules on everything from what you wear to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/gender-and-parenting/\">how families operate</a>, whom you are allowed to partner with and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/02/15/chart-the-most-gendered-occupations\">what jobs you are likely to hold</a>. Whether in the spheres of culture, family, economic or civic life, gender roles and norms intersect with class, race and other social differences and shift across cultures and historical eras. Indigenous societies across the globe have long recognized more than two gender categories, and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/\">historical and contemporary examples of gender diversity</a> abound. </p>\n\n<p>A ban on learning about gender would sweep aside all this variation in favor of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/antagonism-to-transgender-rights-is-tied-to-the-authoritarian-desire-for-social-conformity-not-just-partisan-affiliation-257431\">homogeneous worldview</a> that deliberately ignores biology, history and lived experience. Denying the diversity of gender makes it easier to impose a conservative worldview and roll back rights.</p>\n\n<h2>Education as a political target</h2>\n\n<p>Anti-gender campaigners view education as a <a href=\"https://www.ei-ie.org/en/item/28600:education-a-key-battleground-for-anti-gender-activists\">major battleground</a> in the fight over societal values. In the U.S., conservative efforts to ban the study of gender and sexuality initially centered on K-12 education, exemplified in bills such as Florida’s 2022 “<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/05/how-floridas-expansion-of-dont-say-gay-law-will-hurt.html\">Don’t Say Gay” law</a>. But the movement has also affected <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/mccarthyisms-shadow-looms-over-controversial-firing-of-texas-professor-who-taught-about-gender-identity-265554\">colleges and universities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Texas A&amp;M’s president <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/19/texas-a-m-welsh-firing-professor-gender-mccoul/\">fired a professor</a> in September 2025 after a student recorded her confrontation with her for discussing gender diversity in a literature course. The student alleged the course was “not legal” because it contradicted “our president’s laws” and her own religious beliefs. The university president also later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/texas-am-president-gender-ideology-controversy.html\">resigned under pressure</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The same month, the chancellor of the Texas Tech University system, citing Trump’s executive order on “gender ideology,” <a href=\"https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/abfdd9310a3422570992857b5b830f2b/Texas%20Tech%20System%20letter.pdf\">banned all faculty members</a> across its five universities from recognizing “more than two sexes” in any course or classroom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Crowd of protestors holding signs inside a capitol building\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697020/original/file-20251017-56-mccz2w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Controlling thought is a means of repressing social movements.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/TransgenderCivilRights/1787e5c3030a4fe3ba003dca1995666c/photo\">AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As the Texas chapter of the American Association of University Professors reminds its members, faculty have a <a href=\"https://aaup-texas.org/blog/f/faculty-rights-standing-against-censorship\">constitutional right to teach and discuss</a> “all matters related to the subject matter of a class” without interference from administrators, politicians or government officials.

This is a spatial skill that developmental psychologists call <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119171492.wecad029\">mental rotation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Whether a person is navigating a new city or doing a cartwheel, they must use mental rotation skills to move shapes or objects in their mind and make sense of where their bodies are going and what surrounds them. </p>\n\n<p>When children play with puzzles, building blocks  or pattern games, they are also practicing mental rotation. </p>\n\n<p>Over time, these skills <a href=\"https://learningsuccess.ai/spatial-reasoning/\">support learning</a> in math, science and reading. This can look like visualizing pulley systems in physics or seeing the differences between <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16306024/\">similar-looking letters</a> such as b and d, which young children often confuse.  </p>\n\n<p>Strong mental rotation skills also lay the foundation for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01938\">doing well in school</a> and developing <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2009-19591-005.html\">interest in careers</a> in science, technology, engineering and math. </p>\n\n<p>Most preschool-age children are not yet learning to read – but it turns out they are still using some of these same spatial reasoning skills as they think about the world around them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FhjYx3EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">We are scholars of</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTpp8cUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">developmental science</a> and were curious to find out how children as young as 3 years old mentally rotate objects. </p>\n\n<p>While there is research on the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201413000476\">age at which children can mentally</a> rotate objects, less is understood about how children are solving mental rotation problems. We found in our research, conducted from 2022 to 2023, that young children are using the same problem-solving <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxlm0000574\">strategies as adults</a> when they solve a mental rotation task. </p>\n\n<h2>Children think visually, just like adults</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.70018\">We used eye-tracking technology</a> to understand how a sample of 148 children, all between 3 and 7 years old, solved different mental rotation problems. Eye-trackers use harmless infrared light to capture eye movements. This technology lets us observe how children solve these problems in real time. </p>\n\n<p>As part of our study, we showed each child a large picture of items such as a fire truck, as well as two smaller pictures of the same truck, one placed above the other and positioned slightly differently.</p>\n\n<p>Children were asked to say which small picture on the right matched the large one on the left. In this example, the correct answer is the top picture, because that top fire truck can be rotated to match the large fire truck. The bottom fire truck was a mirrored image, and no matter how much you rotate it, it will never match the large fire truck. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=247&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692995/original/file-20250925-64-xywaer.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=310&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Children looked at pictures of fire trucks as part of a research study to assess how they manipulated the object in their heads.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Karinna Rodriguez</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While the children thought about their response, the eye-tracker, mounted right below the computer screen, recorded their eye movements. </p>\n\n<p>By looking at where and for how long children looked at each image, we figured out what kind of strategy they were using. </p>\n\n<p>Some children focused on fewer parts of the object and spent less time studying its details.

Parents can <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2023/the-power-of-play\">help children</a> by offering them opportunities to practice rotating real objects with toys such as three-dimensional puzzles or building blocks. Tangrams – flat, colorful puzzles that come in different shapes – can be used to practice breaking down shapes of animals into pieces. Parents can encourage their child to look for shapes that match parts of the animal or object they are building. </p>\n\n<p>Nov. 8 is <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/aasl/advocacy/promo/STEM\">International STEM Day</a>, a celebration of all things science, technology, engineering and mathematics. </p>\n\n<p>Research like ours provides valuable guidance for designing early STEM activities and educational tools. By directly observing children’s problem solving in real time, we can develop better ways for educators and toy makers to support strong spatial thinking from an early age. To celebrate, we encourage people to engage in activities that test their spatial skills, such as ditching the GPS for the day or <a href=\"https://www.freetetris.org/game.php\">playing a game of Tetris</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Mental rotation is a powerful skill that helps us understand and interact with the surrounding physical world. From solving puzzles to reading maps, mental rotation plays a role in many everyday activities. Building mental rotation abilities can improve children’s performance in subjects such as reading, math and science and may inspire future careers in STEM fields.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264532/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Pruden receives funding from National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development and National Science Foundation. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Karinna Rodriguez does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

That’s according to our new research examining whether homes destroyed in Colorado’s <a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/looking-back-at-colorados-marshall-fire/\">Marshall Fire</a> — which burned more than 1,000 houses in suburban Boulder County — have been rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://www.tonycookson.com/\">economists</a> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/emgallag/\">who study</a> the financial resources available to households to cope with disasters, including insurance, crowdfunding and federal disaster aid.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past five years, insurance premiums in <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2024/09/07/colorado-homeowners-insurance-costs-premiums/\">Colorado rose nearly 60%</a>, driven by mounting losses from wildfire, hail and other disasters. These patterns are not unique to Colorado. They reflect a broader <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/insurance-for-homeowners-premium-rates/\">national reassessment of risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our new research sheds light on this issue by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5057551\">linking confidential, contract-level data</a> to real rebuilding outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Our study analyzes 3,089 policies from 14 major insurers held by people affected by the Marshall Fire. The findings offer concrete steps homeowners can take now to reduce the risk of holding insufficient coverage. </p>\n\n<h2>How common is underinsurance?</h2>\n\n<p>Underinsurance is determined by comparing the amount of coverage a homeowner carries to rebuild the physical structure of their home to the actual cost of rebuilding after a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>To estimate each unique home’s rebuilding cost, the study used construction-cost software and adjusted the estimates to align with a sample of real-world construction quotes received by homeowners after the Marshall Fire. </p>\n\n<p>We found that 74% of homeowners affected by the Marshall Fire were underinsured, and 36% were so severely underinsured that their policy covered less than 75% of the rebuild cost.</p>\n\n<p>According <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5057551\">to our research</a>, underinsurance was not just a problem for poorer households. Even for households with incomes above US$180,000, 72% held policies that did not cover the cost of a complete rebuild. </p>\n\n<p>Credit scores and mortgage debt amounts were unrelated to how underinsured people were.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Dozens of homes are in various stages of being built.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694378/original/file-20251003-56-2dj4fj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">After the Marshall Fire, hundreds of homes were being rebuilt at once, which drove the costs of rebuilding up.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/louisville-colorado-rebuilding-is-underway-a-year-after-news-photo/2217534380?adppopup=true\">UCG/GettyImages</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>After major fires, construction costs typically spike as hundreds of survivors rebuild at once. To help manage this risk, many <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/underinsurance-homes-los-angeles-20363535.php\">homeowners purchase an Extended Replacement Cost policy</a>, which boosts coverage by a set percentage of the existing coverage limit if rebuilding costs end up higher than the coverage limit. </p>\n\n<p>Eighty-seven percent of the Marshall Fire policies we studied included extended coverage. But nearly three-quarters of them still <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2025/06/06/826665.htm\">fell short of covering the full cost to rebuild</a>. Our study found that while extended coverage policies cushion the impact of postfire construction cost inflation, they do not solve the deeper problem of underinsurance. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, even without the surge in costs, most households had bought too little coverage from the outset.</p>\n\n<h2>Price shopping vs. the coverage you actually need</h2>\n\n<p>Our research finds that the insurance company a household chooses strongly predicts how much coverage the household has. That’s even after accounting for income, mortgage status, credit score, home value and property characteristics. In other words, insurers differ systematically in the coverage levels they tend to provide. </p>\n\n<p>When shopping, homeowners attend to the headline premium, or the total cost of insurance, but not to how much coverage that premium actually buys. Indeed, if shoppers compared insurer quotes for the same coverage amount, they would gain about $290 per year in value, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32579\">roughly 10% of the average annual</a> homeowners insurance premium. </p>\n\n<h2>Why underinsurance slows recovery</h2>\n\n<p>Underinsurance isn’t an abstract problem offset by savings, loans and federal aid. It leaves real gaps in rebuilding. </p>\n\n<p>The study found that when a household’s insurance coverage falls short of the home’s replacement cost, the household is significantly less likely to rebuild after a total loss.

Construction <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/02/03/marshall-fire-survivors-face-high-costs-supply-shortages-as-they-look-to-rebuild/\">costs in the region rose steeply</a> in the lead-up to the Marshall Fire due to the pandemic and related inflation. If you haven’t updated your coverage recently, revisit it annually — especially if you remodeled or added square footage. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjwn0KsgeE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A good explainer of how to make a home inventory from the Minnesota Department of Commerce.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Consider insurer reputation and local presence. Different insurance companies will suggest different coverage limits for the exact same property. The study finds that companies with deeper roots in the community are less likely to underinsure, likely due to concerns about their reputation — something worth weighing alongside price. </p>\n\n<p>The Front Range will continue to face wildfire seasons where <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/r02/fire/prevention/confronting-wildfire-crisis\">wind, drought and human ignition</a> interact in populated areas, and premiums are unlikely to snap back quickly. For households, the most practical step is to shop for insurance and renew policies as if a total loss could happen tomorrow.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263702/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Tony Cookson received funding from the National Bureau of Economic Research Household Finance Small Grants Program. </span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Emily Gallagher is affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

For generations, people have believed that the Moon has the power to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/full-moon-effects?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stir up sleepless nights and strange behavior</a> – even madness itself. The word “lunacy” comes directly from luna, Latin for Moon. </p>\n\n<p>Police officers, hospital staff and emergency workers often swear that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-really-believe-bad-things-happen-on-a-full-moon-1476719218\">their nights get busier under a full moon</a>. But does science back that up? </p>\n\n<p>The answer is, of course, more nuanced than folklore suggests. Research shows a full moon can modestly affect sleep, but its influence on mental health is much less certain.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">neurologist specializing in sleep medicine</a> who studies how sleep affects brain health. I find it captivating that an ancient myth about moonlight and madness might trace back to something far more ordinary: our restless, moonlit sleep.</p>\n\n<h2>What the full moon really does to sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Several studies show that people really do sleep differently in the days leading up to the full moon, when moonlight shines brightest in the evening sky. During this period, people <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.029\">sleep about 20 minutes less</a>, take longer to fall asleep and <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2014.06.020\">spend less time in deep, restorative sleep</a>. Large population studies <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe0465\">confirm the pattern</a>, finding that people across different cultures tend to go to bed later and sleep for shorter periods in the nights before a full moon. </p>\n\n<p>The most likely reason is light. A bright moon in the evening can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1897609\">delay the body’s internal clock, reduce melatonin</a> – the hormone that signals bedtime – and keep the brain more alert.</p>\n\n<p>The changes are modest. Most people lose only 15 to 30 minutes of sleep, but the effect is measurable. It is <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe0465\">strongest in places without artificial light</a>, such as rural areas or while camping. Some research also suggests that <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150222\">men and women may be affected differently</a>. For instance, men seem to lose more sleep during the waxing phase, while women experience slightly less deep and restful sleep around the full moon.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Young adult woman lying in bed wide awake, staring out the window toward a bright light.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697345/original/file-20251020-56-40s28f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=424&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Sleep loss from a bright moon is modest but measurable.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/disturbed-annoyed-african-american-young-woman-royalty-free-image/2200045224?phrase=tossing%20and%20turning%20sleep&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">Yuliia Kaveshnikova/iStock via Getty Images Plus</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>The link with mental health</h2>\n\n<p>For centuries, people have blamed the full moon for stirring up madness. Folklore suggested that <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0327(99)00016-6\">its glow could spark</a> <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2016.263\">mania in bipolar disorder</a>, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000210482.75864.e8\">provoke seizures in people with epilepsy</a> or trigger <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2019.1625054\">psychosis in those with schizophrenia</a>. The theory was simple: lose sleep under a bright moon and vulnerable minds might unravel. </p>\n\n<p>Modern science adds an important twist. Research is clear that sleep loss itself is a powerful driver of mental health problems. Even one rough night can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsae091\">heighten anxiety and drag down mood</a>. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101429\">Ongoing sleep disruption</a> raises the risk of depression, suicidal thoughts and flare-ups of conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.</p>\n\n<p>That means even the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.029\">modest sleep loss</a> seen around a full moon could matter more for people who are already at risk. Someone with bipolar disorder, for example, may be far <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.12.098\">more sensitive to shortened or fragmented sleep</a> than the average person.</p>\n\n<p>But here’s the catch: When researchers step back and look at large groups of people, the evidence that lunar phases trigger psychiatric crises is weak. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20070\">No reliable pattern has been found</a> between the Moon and hospital admissions, discharges or lengths of stay.</p>\n\n<p>But a few other studies suggest there may be small effects. In India, psychiatric hospitals recorded <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1849253\">more use of restraints</a> during full moons, based on data collected between 2016 and 2017. In China, researchers noted a <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2019.1625054\">slight rise in schizophrenia admissions</a> around the full moon, using hospital records from 2012 to 2017. Still, these findings are not consistent worldwide and may reflect cultural factors or local hospital practices as much as biology. </p>\n\n<p>In the end, the Moon may shave a little time off our sleep, and sleep loss can certainly influence mental health, especially for people who are more vulnerable. That includes those with conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or epilepsy, and teenagers who are especially sensitive to sleep disruption. But the idea that the full moon directly drives waves of psychiatric illness remains more myth than reality.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q17i1srjOqY?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The sleep/wake cycle is synchronized with lunar phases.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Other theories fall short</h2>\n\n<p>Over the years, scientists have explored other explanations for supposed lunar effects, from <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.003\">gravitational “tidal” pulls</a> on the body to <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.0324\">subtle geomagnetic changes</a> and <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-025-02954-z\">shifts in barometric pressure</a>. Yet, none of these mechanisms hold up under scrutiny. </p>\n\n<p>The gravitational forces that move oceans are far too weak to affect human physiology, and studies of geomagnetic and atmospheric changes during lunar phases have yielded inconsistent or negligible results. This makes sleep disruption from <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2017.00189\">nighttime light exposure</a> the most plausible link between the Moon and human behavior.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the myth lingers</h2>\n\n<p>If the science is so inconclusive, why do so many people believe in the “full moon effect”? Psychologists point to a concept called <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00016-6\">illusory correlation</a>. We notice and remember the unusual nights that coincide with a full moon but forget the many nights when nothing happened.</p>\n\n<p>The Moon is also highly visible. Unlike hidden sleep disruptors such as <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.08.024\">stress</a>, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2023.101764\">caffeine</a> or <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.2493\">scrolling on a phone</a>, the Moon is right there in the sky, easy to blame.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A woman staring at her cellphone while lying in the dark.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697347/original/file-20251020-56-68pmex.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Screen-time habits are far more likely to have detrimental effects on sleep than a full moon.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/woman-using-a-mobile-phone-while-lying-in-bed-at-royalty-free-image/1423376521?phrase=screens%20nightime%20sleep&amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;adppopup=true\">FanPro/Moment via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Lessons from the Moon for modern sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Even if the Moon does not drive us “mad,” its small influence on sleep highlights something important: Light at night matters.</p>\n\n<p>Our bodies are designed to follow the natural cycle of light and dark. Extra light in the evening, whether from moonlight, streetlights or phone screens, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00877-7\">can delay circadian rhythms</a>, reduce melatonin and lead to lighter, more fragmented sleep.</p>\n\n<p>This same biology helps explain the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8780\">health risks of daylight saving time</a>. When clocks “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-the-days-of-springing-forward-be-numbered-a-neurologist-and-sleep-expert-explains-the-downside-to-that-borrowed-hour-of-daylight-224597\">spring forward</a>,” evenings stay artificially brighter. That shift <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-daylight-saving-time-is-unhealthy-a-neurologist-explains-175427\">delays sleep and disrupts circadian timing</a> on a much larger scale than the Moon, contributing to increased <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/daylight-saving-time-and-early-school-start-times-cost-billions-in-lost-productivity-and-health-care-expenses-248280\">accidents and cardiovascular risks, as well as reduced workplace safety</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In our modern world, artificial light has a much bigger impact on sleep than the Moon ever will. That is why many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.10898\">sleep experts argue for permanent standard time</a>, which better matches our biological rhythms.</p>\n\n<p>So if you find yourself restless on a full moon night, you may not be imagining things – the Moon can tug at your sleep. But if sleeplessness happens often, look closer to home. It is likely a culprit of the light in your hand rather than the one in the sky.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267528/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Countries worldwide are experiencing intensifying storms, dangerous heat waves and rising seas as global temperatures rise.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, after 30 years of international climate talks, 10 years of a <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">global treaty</a> promising to keep temperatures in check, and <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/\">trillions of dollars in damage</a>, the world is still not on track to stop rising global temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions were at <a href=\"https://wmo.int/publication-series/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin-no-21\">record highs in 2024</a>, and it was Earth’s <a href=\"https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level\">hottest year on record</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dornsife.online.usc.edu/sm/faculty/shannon-gibson/\">I study</a> the dynamics of global environmental politics, including the United Nations climate negotiations. And I and my lab have been tracking countries’ latest climate pledges – known as <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs\">nationally determined contributions</a>, or NDCs – to see which countries have stepped up their efforts, which have slid back and who has ideas that can deliver a safer world for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>While the Trump administration has been <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/09/not-up-for-discussion-brussels-rejects-washingtons-pressure-on-climate-rules\">pressuring countries</a> to back away from their climate commitments – and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/climate/shipping-pollution-fee-international-maritime-organization.html\">succeeded in delaying an International Maritime Organization vote</a> on a global plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions from shipping after <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/taking-action-to-defend-america-from-the-uns-first-global-carbon-tax-the-international-maritime-organizations-imo-net-zero-framework-nzf\">threatening other counties with sanctions, visa restrictions and port fees</a> if they supported it – many countries are still pressing ahead. </p>\n\n<h2>Trump agitates, but many countries are steadfast</h2>\n\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration came into office vowing to <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/trump-issues-executive-order-climate-change-0\">eliminate climate regulations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\">boost the fossil fuel industry</a>, derided concerns about climate change in his Sept. 23, 2025, speech to the U.N. General Assembly. He called climate change the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9I5yfQUQ7U\">greatest con job ever perpetuated”</a> and ridiculed green energy and climate science.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s language no longer surprises world leaders, though. More than 100 other countries <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-summit-2025\">announced new climate commitments</a> during a high-level summit a few days later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>China</strong>, currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, was lauded for <a href=\"https://www.renewableinstitute.org/china-surpasses-2030-renewable-energy-goals-years-ahead-of-schedule/\">hitting its green energy targets five years early</a>. Its rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and electric vehicle manufacturing has reduced pollution in Chinese cities while also boosting its economy and expanding the government’s influence around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country’s <a href=\"http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2025-09/25/c_1128276.htm\">first absolute emissions reduction goal</a> at the summit, committing to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035. China also committed to nearly triple its solar and wind power capacity and expand reforestation efforts.</p>\n\n<p>While advocates and other governments had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/chinas-new-climate-target-falls-well-short-eu-says-2025-09-25/\">hoped for a stronger announcement</a> from China, the new goals mark an important shift from the country’s earlier carbon intensity targets, which aimed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output but still allowed emissions to grow over time.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"vqYwv\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vqYwv/1/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><strong>The European Union</strong> has yet to submit its new commitments, but the group of 27 European countries <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/09/18/paris-agreement-eu-submits-statement-of-intent-to-the-unfccc-on-the-post-2030-ndc/#:%7E:text=Background,(NDCs)%20(UNFCCC%20website)\">delivered a letter of intent</a>, saying it would commit to a 66% to 72% collective decrease in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Europe has seen a swift rise in renewable energy, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/russias-war-on-ukraine\">up sharply since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a> put the continent’s natural gas supplies in jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p>The EU has also made waves by extending its carbon pricing rules beyond its borders.</p>\n\n<p>The EU’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/carbon-border-tax-us-china-and-india-lash-out-at-eu-climate-policy.html\">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a>, scheduled to begin in January 2026, will be the first system to charge for the climate impact of imported goods coming into Europe from countries that don’t have carbon prices similar to the EU’s. The measure, meant to even the playing field for EU industries, sets a global precedent for linking carbon emissions to trade. </p>\n\n<p>However, the EU’s climate plans are also facing some headwinds. Its parliament is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-parliament-plans-cut-back-sustainability-law-further-2025-10-08/\">moving toward softening</a> new corporate sustainability requirements <a href=\"https://www.netzeroinvestor.net/news-and-views/eu-policy-makers-back-down-on-transition-plans-amid-us-pressure\">after pressure from companies</a>. And it may face calls from some member countries to <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/10/20/eu-nations-to-push-for-delay-to-controversial-new-carbon-market-00613488\">delay a new carbon market meant</a> to cut emissions from road transportation and buildings, Politico reported.</p>\n\n<p>The EU has pledged to mobilize <a href=\"https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k12/k12ebey0bu?_gl=1*1cuxjhu*_ga*MTY2MTgzNzQzMS4xNzU5NTg3MjM4*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*czE3NTk2OTYxNTkkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTk2OTkzMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw\">up to 300 billion Euros</a> (about US$350 billion) to support the global clean energy transition in developing countries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The United Kingdom, Japan and Australia</strong> submitted their most ambitious targets to date. All three put them on track to reach <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-new-york-climate-summit-climate-watch-flags-huge-emissions-gap-101758709221135.html\">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, meaning any greenhouse gases they emit will be offset by projects that avoid carbon emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>In Australia, Queensland’s recent announcement that it would <a href=\"https://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/policies-and-programs/energy/energy-roadmap/\">extend existing coal power plant use</a> to the 2030s and 2040s may slow national progress. But Queensland also supports scaling up renewable energy and is still <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-10/queensland-government-to-establish-400m-energy-fund/105874318\">aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Norway</strong> committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker?search=norway\">at least 70% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels</a>, which would align with the Paris Agreement goal to keep global emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). However, it <a href=\"https://www.sodir.no/en/whats-new/publications/reports/resource-report/resource-report-2022/6--future-production-and-revenues/\">plans to remain</a> a major oil and gas exporter.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, many developing countries also stepped up their commitments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brazil</strong> <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/brazil/\">pledged a net emissions reduction of 59% to 67% by 2035</a> and is maintaining its 2050 net-zero target. The government also drew criticism for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2735yp75ko\">approving plans for oil exploration</a> near the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n\n<h2>Free riding and taking cover behind the US</h2>\n\n<p>However, while some new climate commitments signal important momentum in the fight against climate change, the tug-of-war between global ambition to slow climate change and strategic self-interests was palpable at the New York summit. The responses to Trump’s remarks revealed both veiled critiques and deceleration of climate action by some governments.</p>\n\n<p>China <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/24/china-doubles-down-on-climate-wind-and-solar-pledges-a-day-after-trump-called-them-a-scam-00579411\">criticized backsliding by some countries</a>, without naming names.</p>\n\n<p>Brazil used the summit to call out countries that were late in submitting their updated climate commitments. Only about a third had submitted their <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/NDCREG\">updated pledges</a> at that point.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Lula da Silva stands in a group talking, including heads of the UN and EU.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695669/original/file-20251010-56-hto9f2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will host the 30th annual U.N. climate conference, COP 30, in November 2025, talks with other world leaders at the U.N. in September 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/COP28ClimateSummit/0126ee9734ea46f7a7bf6afdbd60cd95/photo\">AP Photo/Peter Dejong</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>While it is difficult to parse out individual country motivations – economic stress, wars and political influence can all play a role – many <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1412934\">scholars worry</a> that <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BFI_WP_2023-146-1.pdf\">U.S. backsliding will lead</a> other countries to reduce their climate commitments, and some recent pledges appear to back this up.</p>\n\n<p>Many petroleum-producing countries missed the U.N. pledge deadline.

The new format would also allow city and state actions to be counted separately, increasing incentives for them to act.</p>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en\">host of the COP30 climate talks</a> Nov. 10-21, 2025, Brazil is uniquely positioned to champion this concept. In the absence of U.S. leadership, the proposal could offer a rare opportunity for countries to collectively strengthen commitments and reshape treaty language in a way never seen before – leaving open the possibility for progress.</p>\n\n<p><em>Wila Mannella, a research assistant and graduate student in environmental studies at USC, contributed to this article.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267194/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Shannon Gibson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

While these long-term risks are important, a less frequently discussed concern is motion sickness.</p>\n\n<p>As a child, one of us (Taylor) was highly prone to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-causes-motion-sickness-heres-how-to-reconcile-the-mismatch-in-what-your-senses-are-telling-your-brain-194802\">motion sickness</a> – whether in the backseat of a car, sitting on a train or riding a bus. At the time, she considered it a cruel twist of fate, but as an adult – <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jY9zD-oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and a scientist to boot</a> – Taylor can tell you with confidence that it was entirely her fault.</p>\n\n<p>You see, like most children during long car rides, Taylor would get bored. So, to combat this boredom, she would either read a book or play on her Gameboy. She would stare down at whatever form of entertainment was in her lap that day until the familiar creeping sensation of nausea developed.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, looking out the side window would help, but more often than not, Taylor’s dad would have to pull over at the next gas station for a short break, or else they’d all suffer the consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Now, she understands what was happening on a more fundamental level. As children, you are taught about the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. However, there is a hidden sixth sense that helps your body understand how you are moving – <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/vestibular-system\">the vestibular system</a>. The brain takes information from all these senses and compares it to what it might expect when moving, based on past experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Optimally, any disagreement between your vestibular senses and your brain’s expectations would be small. But when there are large, sustained conflicts, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1139/y90-044\">you get sick</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While reading in the car, Taylor was staring at nonmoving words on a page while her vestibular system told her brain she was traveling down a road. This discrepancy confused her brain since usually, when Taylor felt movement, she should see the world shifting around her in the same way – hence her motion sickness. Had she been looking out the window and watching the world pass by, she would have been fine. Even better, had she been in the front seat, she would have been able to see the road ahead and predict how she would move in the future.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"The view from the driver's seat of a car, showing the top of a steering wheel, the windshield view and the rearview mirror.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693945/original/file-20251001-56-inf1na.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Looking out the front window while driving can help mitigate motion sickness by aligning your vestigial senses with how your brain expects to be moving.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/close-up-of-side-view-mirror-seen-through-car-royalty-free-image/2168528390?phrase=windshield\">EyeEm Mobile GmbH/iStock via Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The sensory conflict between what you experience and what your brain expects doesn’t cause only carsickness.

Gray/Kennedy Space Center</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>These conditions are not rare. Over half of all astronauts experience some symptoms of space motion sickness when they first get to space, and terrestrial readaptation motion sickness <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9889-0_14\">occurs at a similar incidence rate</a> when they come back down. </p>\n\n<h2>Dangers to astronauts</h2>\n\n<p>If you have ever experienced motion sickness, you know how hard it is to do anything other than close your eyes and take deep breaths to expel the creeping urge to vomit. As a passenger in a car, that may be OK, since you aren’t expected to jump into action at a moment’s notice. But while isolated on the water in a return capsule, astronauts need to remain focused and clearheaded. In case of an emergency, they’ll need to respond rapidly. </p>\n\n<p>If the astronauts need to get out of the capsule prior to pickup up by the recovery team, any motion sickness they have could delay their response time and impede evacuation attempts. </p>\n\n<h2>Potential solutions</h2>\n\n<p>Presently, most astronauts rely <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html\">on medication</a> that interrupts the brain’s ability to use <a href=\"https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bcp.70056\">hormones to trigger motion sickness</a>. However, as with many commercial products, these drugs can cause side effects such as drowsiness and can lose efficacy over time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-025-00478-9\">Our research team completed two experiments</a> to investigate how we might be able to manipulate visual information to mitigate motion sickness in astronauts, without relying on pharmaceuticals.</p>\n\n<p>Our participants were exposed to motions meant to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/VES-2007-175-612\">simulate transitions between gravity environments</a> and then <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-023-06715-5\">ocean wavelike motion</a>. During the hour of wavelike motion, we investigated whether a “virtual window” could reduce the incidence of motion sickness. </p>\n\n<p>When in a capsule on the ocean, astronauts are strapped into their seats and likely cannot see out of the small windows built into the capsule. In place of windows, we used virtual reality headsets to create a full-view virtual window.</p>\n\n<p>In our control group, the subjects received no visual cues of motion – akin to Taylor’s poorly advised backseat reading. Meanwhile, one countermeasure group got to see a visual scene that moved naturally with their motion, like looking out the side window of the car at the surrounding world. The other countermeasure group saw a scene that moved appropriately and was provided an overlay showing future motion, like looking out the front window and seeing the road ahead.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3Aijwo_diU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The device moving in a wavelike motion.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>As expected, the group with no cues of motion got the sickest. Two-thirds of the subjects needed to stop prior to finishing an hour of wavelike motion, due to excessive nausea. Only about one-fifth of the group that was given the side window view needed to stop early. Only one-tenth of the front window group that received present and future visual cues dropped out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-025-00478-9\">These results</a> mean that by tracking the capsule motion and projecting it on a headset for the astronauts inside, our team may be able to reduce debilitating motion sickness by roughly half. If we could figure out how to predict how the capsule would move, we could give them that front window experience and improve the landing even more. In case of emergency, they could always take off the headsets.</p>\n\n<p>This work shows promise for motion sickness interventions that do not rely on pharmaceuticals, which are currently used to combat these effects. Our solutions don’t have the same concerns around shelf life, stability or side effects. In addition to the benefits for astronauts, such approaches could help those prone to motion sickness here on Earth, particularly in scenarios where looking out the front window at the road isn’t feasible, such as on planes, trains, buses or high-speed transportation.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263706/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Human Research Program under Grant No. 80NSSC21K0257.</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Torin Clark receives funding from NASA, the Office of Naval Research and the National Institutes for Health, and he receives fellowships from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and the National Science Foundation. </span></em></p>",

For most social scientists and policymakers who have long declared polygamy a “<a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/general-comments-and-recommendations/joint-general-recommendation-no-31-committee\">harmful cultural practice</a>,” the decision was a frustrating but predictable setback in efforts to build healthier and more equal societies.</p>\n\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, polygamy takes the form of one husband and multiple wives – more precisely referred to as polygyny, originating from the Greek words “poly” (“many”) and “gynē” (“woman or wife”). The opposite arrangement of one wife and multiple husbands is referred to as polyandry (from “anēr” meaning “man” or “husband”) and is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/12/07/polygamy-is-rare-around-the-world-and-mostly-confined-to-a-few-regions/\">exceedingly rare worldwide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Critics of polygyny present two main arguments. First, they contend it squeezes low-status men out of the marriage market, fostering social unrest, crime and violence against women by frustrated unwed men. Second, it harms women and children by dividing limited resources among more dependents.</p>\n\n<p>This logic has led leading political scientist Rose McDermott <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501718045/the-evils-of-polygyny\">to describe polygyny as evil</a>.

The project is a collaboration between demographer <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s3PC39wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Hampton Gaddy</a> and evolutionary anthropologists <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HBjME2gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Rebecca Sear</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-laura-fortunato\">Laura Fortunato</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers drew on demographic modeling and an extraordinary trove of census data – over 84 million records from 30 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceania, plus the entire U.S. census from 1880, when polygyny was practiced in some American communities. They demonstrate that polygyny does not lock large numbers of men out of marriage. In fact, in many contexts, men are actually more likely to marry where polygyny is common than where it is rare.</p>\n\n<p>The narrative that polygyny leads to lonely bachelors is intuitive. In a community with equal numbers of men and women, if one man marries two wives, then another man must remain unmarried. Expand that across a whole society, and polygyny looks like a recipe for an army of resentful, single men.</p>\n\n<p>Parallel arguments have been made about the rise of incel – a portmanteau of “involuntary” and “celibate” – subcultures within monogamous nations, including the U.S. Here, the argument is that high-status men leave low-status men sexless and frustrated, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-06236-6\">ultimately leading to violence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble is that real demography is not so simple. Women typically <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1701535115\">live longer than men</a>, men frequently <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.002\">marry younger women</a>, and populations in many parts of the world <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.160\">are growing</a>, ensuring younger spouses are available for older cohorts. These factors, which are characteristic of many contemporary African nations, tilt the marriage market toward a surplus of women. Under many realistic conditions, a sizable proportion of men can have multiple wives without leaving their peers out in the cold.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in nearly half of the countries examined, higher rates of polygyny were associated with fewer, not more, unmarried men. Only a handful of countries showed the expected positive relationship, and even then inconsistently over time.</p>\n\n<p>The case of historical Mormon communities in North America is equally revealing. When the researchers compared counties with documented Mormon polygyny to others in the 1880 census, they found lower rates of unmarried men in polygynous areas. Gaddy and his colleagues contend that this is explained by the tendency for cultural norms that favor polygyny to also be relatively pronatalist, driving marriage rates upward for all.</p>\n\n<h2>Do women and children get a smaller share?</h2>\n\n<p>What about the argument that polygyny harms women and children by dividing male-owned wealth among more mouths to feed? There certainly are studies that have demonstrated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1100306108\">associations between polygyny and poor health</a>. But another line of thinking argues that correlation should not be equated with causation. </p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago, my colleages and I documented that polygyny is associated with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1507151112\">higher food insecurity and poor child health</a> when comparing outcomes across over 50 Tanzanian villages. However, this pattern was an artifact of polygyny being most common in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110447\">marginalized Maasai communities</a>, which tend to live in drought-prone areas with inadequate health care. Moreover, when comparing families within communities, polygynous households were typically wealthier, a key factor in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00164897\">making polygyny attractive to women</a>, and children were not disadvantaged.</p>\n\n<p>Echoing these results, anthropologist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6mj6WIIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Riana Minocher</a> and her colleagues recently published a study that uses a detailed, longitudinal dataset from a 20-year prospective study in another region of Tanzania. Analyzing survival, growth and education for thousands of children, they found <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2407785121\">no evidence that monogamous marriage is advantageous</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Together, these results support a theory known as the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00164897\">polygyny threshold model</a>. Simply put, provided women have choice in marriage, sharing a husband is unlikely to be economically detrimental, since they will prioritize marrying men with sufficient wealth to offset any cost. This scenario may not fit all contexts, but these studies clearly undercut claims that polygyny is unequivocally harmful.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"89Opa\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/89Opa/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Hidden advantages of polygyny</h2>\n\n<p>Another recent study, published in August 2025 by economist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ImGKy8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Sylvain Dessy</a> and his colleagues, goes further, suggesting that polygyny <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhaf020\">has unrecognized advantages</a> when times are tough. </p>\n\n<p>Drawing on crop yield data from over 4,000 farm households across Mali, census data on marriage patterns and detailed meteorological records, they found that in villages where polygyny is rare, droughts cut harvests dramatically. But in villages where polygyny is common, that blow is softened.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers argue that polygynous marriage, by increasing the number of in-laws, creates stronger networks of social support. Furthermore, with wives often coming from different villages and regions, extended kin are well positioned to send food, money or labor when local crops fail. Such support helps to explain both the resilience of polygynous communities during drought and the continued endurance of the marriage practice from one generation to the next.</p>\n\n<h2>So, is polygyny harmless?</h2>\n\n<p>These studies don’t mean that polygyny is harmless. Indeed, allowing men but not women to have multiple spouses is clearly unequal and entwined with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02734133\">patriarchal ideology</a> that positions women as subordinate or inferior to men. Recent studies, for example, have suggested that polygynous marriages are more <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-22581-y\">prone to intimate partner violence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In short, there remain multiple ways polygyny can be harmful.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the best evidence suggests that polygyny is unlikely to be a root cause of social unrest. Moreover, within wider patriarchal systems that afford few women, regardless of marital status, economic and social security, polygyny may not just be a tolerable choice but in some contexts a preferred arrangement with tangible benefits for both genders. </p>\n\n<p>Simplistic stories about the dangers of polygyny can be compelling and intuitive, but they risk misleading the public, reinforcing stubborn notions of Western cultural superiority and disrupting effective global health policy by sidelining more pertinent initiatives. Building healthier societies necessitates paying attention to the evidence and remaining open to the possibility that all family structures have capacity to cause harm.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267201/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David W.

However, over the past five years among the U.S. airlines, the <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-02-26-01/\">risk of dying was almost zero</a>. In fact, you have a much better chance of winning most lotteries than you do of dying as a passenger on a U.S. air carrier. </p>\n\n<p>How did flying get so safe? And can we apply the hard-earned safety lessons from aviation to artificial intelligence?</p>\n\n<p>When humanity introduces a new paradigm-shifting technology and that technology is rapidly adopted globally, the future consequences are unknown and often collectively feared. The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/history/120-years-ago-the-first-powered-flight-at-kitty-hawk/\">introduction of powered flight</a> in 1903 by the Wright brothers was no exception. There were many objections to this new technology, including religious, political and <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4065/4065-h/4065-h.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com#chap21\">technical</a> concerns.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t long after powered flight was introduced that the first airplane accident occurred – and by not long I mean the same day. It happened on <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/history/120-years-ago-the-first-powered-flight-at-kitty-hawk/\">the Wright brothers’ fourth flight</a>. The first person to die in an aircraft accident <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/object/1909-wright-military-flyer%3Anasm_A19120001000\">was killed five years later in 1908</a>. Since then, there have been over 89,000 airplane accidents globally. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a researcher who <a href=\"https://campus.und.edu/directory/james.higgins\">studies air travel safety</a>, and I see how today’s AI industry resembles the early – and decidedly less safe – years of the aviation industry.</p>\n\n<h2>From studying accidents to predicting them</h2>\n\n<p>Although tragic, each accident and each fatality represented a moment for reflection and learning. Accident investigators attempted to recreate every accident and identify accident precursors and root causes. Once investigators identified what led up to each crash, aircraft makers and operators put safety measures into effect in hopes of preventing additional accidents. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if a pilot in the earlier era of flight forgot to lower the landing gear prior to landing, a landing accident was the likely result. So the industry figured out to install warning systems that would alert pilots about the unsafe state of the landing gear – a lesson learned only after accidents. This reactive process, while necessary, is a heavy price to pay to learn how to improve safety.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the 20th century, the aviation world <a href=\"https://www2023.icao.int/about-icao/History/Pages/Milestones-in-International-Civil-Aviation.aspx\">organized and standardized its operations, procedures and processes</a>. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Civil Aeronautics Act, which <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/about/history/brief_history\">established the Civil Aeronautics Authority</a>. This precursor to the Federal Aviation Administration included an Air Safety Board. </p>\n\n<p>The fully reactive safety paradigm shifted over time to proactive and eventually predictive. In 1997, a group of industry, labor and government aviation organizations formed a group called the <a href=\"https://www.cast-safety.org/\">Commercial Aviation Safety Team</a>. They started to look at the data and attempted to find trends and analyze user reports to identify risks and hazards before they became full-blown accidents. </p>\n\n<p>The group, which includes the FAA and NASA, decided early on that there would be no competition among airlines when it came to safety. The industry would openly share safety data. When was the last time you saw an airline advertising campaign claiming “our airline is safer than theirs”?</p>\n\n<h2>It’s down to data</h2>\n\n<p>The Commercial Aviation Safety Team helped the industry transition from reactive to predictive by adopting a data-driven, systemic approach to tackling safety issues. It generated this data using reports from people and data from aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Every day, millions of flights occur worldwide, and on every single one of those flights, thousands of data points are recorded. Aviation safety professionals now use <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/Pages/cvr_fdr.aspx\">Flight Data Recorders</a> – long used to investigate accidents after the fact – to analyze data from every flight. By closely examining all this data, safety analysts can <a href=\"https://nbaa.org/aircraft-operations/safety/safety-data-collection-analysis-and-sharing/flight-data-monitoring-fdm/\">spot emerging and troublesome events and trends</a>. For example, by analyzing the data, a trained safety scientist can spot if certain aircraft approaches to runways are becoming riskier due to factors like excessive airspeed and poor alignment – before a landing accident occurs.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Two orange metal containers, one a horizontal cylinder and the other a rectangular box\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=401&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697353/original/file-20251020-56-hudyzl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Flight voice and data recorders are well known from accident investigations, but the data from ordinary flights is invaluable for preventing accidents.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flightrecorders.JPG\">YSSYguy/Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To further increase proactive and predictive capabilities, anyone who operates within the aviation system can submit <a href=\"https://www.natca.org/foundations-of-professionalism/atsap/\">anonymous and nonpunitive safety reports</a>.

The risk of dying as a passenger onboard a U.S. airline is now <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/how-much-training-should-an-airline-pilot-need-db974a91\">less than 1 in 98 million</a>. You are more likely to die <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/is-flying-safer-than-driving/\">on your drive to the airport</a> than in an aircraft accident. Now, more than 100 years since the advent of powered flight, the aviation industry – after learning hard lessons – has become extremely safe. </p>\n\n<h2>A model for AI</h2>\n\n<p>AI is rapidly permeating many facets of life, from self-driving cars to criminal justice actions and hiring and loan decisions. The technology is far from foolproof, however, and errors attributable to AI have had life-altering – and in some cases even <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-teslas-autopilot-crashes-spurred-the-feds-to-investigate-driver-assist-technologies-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-166307\">life-and-death</a> – consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all AI companies are trying to implement some <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework\">safety measures</a>. But they appear to be making these efforts individually, just like the early players in the aviation field did. And these efforts are largely reactive, waiting for AI to make a mistake and then acting. </p>\n\n<p>What if there was a group like the Commercial Aviation Safety Team where all AI companies, regulators, academia and other interested parties convened to start the proactive and predictive processes of ensuring AI doesn’t lead to calamities?</p>\n\n<p>From a reporting perspective, imagine if every AI interface had a report button that a user could click to not only report potentially hallucinated and unsafe results to each company, but also report the same to an AI organization modeled on the Commercial Aviation Safety Team. In addition, data generated by AI systems, much like we see in aviation, could also be collected, aggregated and analyzed for safety threats.  </p>\n\n<p>Although this approach may not be the ultimate solution to preventing harm from AI, if Big Tech adopts lessons learned from other <a href=\"https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/high-reliability\">high-consequence industries</a> like aviation, it just might learn to regulate, control and, yes, make AI safer for all to use.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265960/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>James Higgins receives funding from the FAA to conduct research regarding flight safety topics.

Streetlamps were ignited, and storefront windows blazed with light.</p>\n\n<p>Residents called Nov. 28, 1939, “<a href=\"https://unrememberedhistory.com/2015/05/19/smog-city-the-day-st-louis-lost-the-sun/\">Black Tuesday</a>.” Day turned to night as thick, acrid clouds blackened the sky. Even at street level, visibility was just a few feet. The air pollution was caused by homes, businesses and factories, which burned soft, sulfur-rich coal for heat and power. The soft coal was cheap and burned easily but produced vast amounts of smoke.</p>\n\n<p>The murky morning was an extreme version of a problem <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/b20278548/page/n5/mode/2up\">St. Louis and dozens of other American cities</a> had been <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.reportofspecialc00sain_0/?st=gallery\">experiencing for decades</a>. Strict federal air pollution regulations were still 30 years away, and state and local efforts to limit coal smoke had failed miserably. </p>\n\n<p>Today, as the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinvigorates-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry/\">Trump administration</a> works to <a href=\"https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-trump-allowed-over-40-power-plants-to-delay-compliance-with-hazardous-air-pollution-limits/\">roll back air pollution limits on coal</a>, the events in St. Louis more than 80 years ago serve as a reminder of how bad a situation can become before people’s objections finally force the government to act. And as I discuss in my book “<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/black-gold/\">Black Gold: The Rise, Reign and Fall of American Coal</a>,” those events also highlight how successful that action can be.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZX4gSDVvLQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The fight for cleaner air is a key part of St. Louis history.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A widespread civic effort</h2>\n\n<p>Days after Black Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/article_011f3bd2-92ea-11ee-8aff-b304fe125ba6.html\">St. Louis Mayor Bernard Dickmann</a> responded to the crisis by creating a commission to investigate and recommend a solution to the continuing air pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Just before Black Tuesday, Joseph Pulitzer II, publisher of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, had launched his own <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/cms/sites/default/files/content/the_pulitzer_prizes_2021_winners_and_finalists.pdf\">anti-smoke newspaper campaign</a> seeking fundamental change. In my research I found the first editorial, on Nov. 13, 1939, which declared “something must be done, or else.” A crack reporter, Sam J. Shelton, was assigned full time to what became the smoke beat. Post-Dispatch news stories, editorials and political cartoons championed the values of cleaner air and the dangers of toxic pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Dickmann’s <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6762905/missouri-fresh-air/\">Smoke Elimination Committee</a> met 13 times over a winter that seemed unrelenting in darkness. News and weather reports record that smoke blotted out the Sun on one out of every three days, and sometimes sunlight never pierced the darkness. Advice poured in, including from a Hollywood-style stuntman and flagpole sitter, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1952/10/12/archives/shipwreck-kelly-dies-on-sidewalk-flagpole-sitter-and-stunt-man-of.html\">Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly</a>, who offered to perch in the sky searching for dirty chimneys.</p>\n\n<p>In late February 1940, the commission issued a report recommending restrictions on smoke emissions. The report said residents and industry should either pay more to buy coal with less sulfur or other fuel, or pay for and install new equipment to burn the sulfur-rich coal more cleanly. On April 5, the city’s Board of Aldermen convened to consider the changes in law that would enact the recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Newspapers reported that more than 300 protesters, including coal dealers, operators and miners, parked their trucks outside City Hall, waving banners. Black smoke spewed upward from coal stoves mounted atop one, newspaper reports said. The boisterous throng marched into City Hall, shouting and often drowning out city representatives. Amid catcalls and boos, the aldermen passed the ordinance 28-1.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zC0vzV0JHcE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">St. Louis did a lot of work to control air pollution from burning coal.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Immediately, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/25/archives/raymond-tucker-st-louis-mayor-195365-executive-is-dead-led-civic.html\">Raymond Tucker</a>, the mayor’s deputy, began arranging for suppliers of more expensive low-sulfur coal for the city’s residents and businesses. He launched a slick public relations campaign urging residents to comply with the new law.

Bootleg coal shipments arrived. More than once, Tucker’s armed inspectors <a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2015/11/20/smoke-inspectors-shoot-at-suspect-coal-bootleggers/\">fired at a suspect truck</a> that ignored orders to stop, according to newspaper reports from the time.</p>\n\n<p>While hopes were already high that the new, tough measures would clean the skies, the winter of 1940-41 <a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2016/01/15/the-weather-bureau-confirms-what-has-now-become-obvious-in-st-louis/\">defied even those rosy expectations</a>. By mid-January, the city’s skies were so <a href=\"https://dnr.mo.gov/air/hows-air/missouri-skies-now-then\">much cleaner than the year before</a> that they were the talk of the town. They were clear blue, and even on days when there was smoke, it was <a href=\"https://dnr.mo.gov/air/hows-air/missouri-skies-now-then\">far less than had been common</a> before the city ordinance passed.</p>\n\n<p>The national press picked up the news, and arriving visitors wrote letters to the editors of their hometown newspapers reporting being astounded by what St. Louis had accomplished that winter. Tucker compiled notes on how many <a href=\"https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt:SCLS030\">communities in the U.S.</a> and Canada sought details on the transformation. In that document, now held among his archives at Washington University in St. Louis, he listed 83.</p>\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://coalblacksky.com/2016/02/04/st-louis-declares-victory-in-air/\">A great city has washed its face</a>,” Sam Shelton wrote for the Post-Dispatch. “St. Louis is no longer the grimy old man of American municipalities.” The “plague of smoke and soot” had been wiped away after a century in “a dramatic story of intelligent, courageous and co-operative effort.” No longer did residents have to endure “burning throats, hacking coughs, smarting eyes, sooty faces and soiled clothing.” </p>\n\n<p>The newspaper was awarded a <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/st-louis-post-dispatch-0\">Pulitzer Prize for public service</a> in 1941 for its campaign, the first time that a major award was conferred for an environmental story. </p>\n\n<p>For years afterward, the coal industry argued that the St. Louis campaign was a fraud that needlessly forced residents to buy more expensive fuel and equipment. But even during World War II, when industrial restrictions meant pollution was worse in the name of driving the war economy, the city’s skies were never as blackened as they had been before.</p>\n\n<p>Tucker, the mayor’s deputy, later used the fame he had achieved from the smoke campaign as a springboard to being elected mayor. He served 12 years. His former boss, Dickmann, was less fortunate, losing his reelection bid in 1941. <a href=\"https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999535365102121/cite\">He blamed it on</a> having forced residents to pay more, even though it meant cleaner fuel for their homes and clearer skies for their community.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265934/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Robert Wyss does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

The opening of the Erie Canal reached beyond Clinton’s Empire State, cementing the Midwest into the prosperity of the growing nation. This human-made waterway transformed America’s economy and <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/news/erie-canal-immigration-wisconsin-laurie-lawlor\">immigration</a> while helping fuel <a href=\"https://nyheritage.org/exhibits/two-hundred-years-erie-canal/burned-over-district\">a passionate religious revival</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But like most big achievements, getting there wasn’t easy. The nation’s first “superhighway” was almost dead on arrival. </p>\n\n<h2>Clinton’s folly</h2>\n\n<p>The idea of connecting New York City to the Great Lakes <a href=\"https://www.albanyinstitute.org/online-exhibition/50-objects/section/erie-canal-2\">originated in the late 18th century</a>. Yet when Clinton pushed to build a canal, the plan was controversial. </p>\n\n<p>The governor and his supporters secured funding through Congress in 1817, but President James Madison vetoed the bill, considering federal support for a state project unconstitutional. New York turned to state bonds to finance the project, which Madison’s ally Thomas Jefferson had <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">derided as “madness</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Some considered “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Water_in_North_American_Environmental_Hi/Tjb-EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=clinton%27s+big+ditch&amp;pg=PA113&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Clinton’s big ditch</a>” blasphemy. “If the Lord had intended there should be internal waterways,” <a href=\"https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813049540\">argued Quaker minister Elias Hicks</a>, “he would have placed them there.” </p>\n\n<p>Construction <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/october/opening-erie-canal\">began on July 4, 1817</a>. Completed eight years later, the canal stretched some 363 miles (584 kilometers), with <a href=\"https://eriecanalway.org/learn/history-culture/fast-facts\">18 aqueducts and 83 locks</a> to compensate for elevation changes en route. All this was built with only basic tools, pack animals and human muscle – the latter supplied by some 9,000 laborers, roughly <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">one-quarter of whom</a> were recent immigrants from Ireland.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A faded chart shows the names of cities, in order from west to east, along with their relative elevation.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=134&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694725/original/file-20251007-66-xgcfkb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=168&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An 1832 lithograph by David H.

The hefty $7 million investment in building the Erie Canal had been <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/whathathgodwroug0000howe_j9v1\">fully recouped</a> in toll fees alone. </p>\n\n<h2>Religious revival</h2>\n\n<p>Nor was its legacy simply economic. Like many Americans during the Industrial Revolution, New Yorkers struggled to find stability, purpose and community. The Erie Canal channeled new ideas and religious movements, including <a href=\"https://www.thearda.com/us-religion/history/timelines/entry?etype=1&amp;eid=326\">the Second Great Awakening</a>: a nationwide movement of Christian evangelism and social reform, partly in reaction to the upheavals of a changing economy. </p>\n\n<p>Though the movement began at the turn of the century, it flourished in the hinterlands along the Erie Canal, which became known as <a href=\"https://nyheritage.org/exhibits/two-hundred-years-erie-canal/burned-over-district\">the “Burned-Over District</a>.” Revivalists like <a href=\"https://www.thearda.com/us-religion/history/timelines/entry?etype=1&amp;eid=246\">Charles Grandison Finney</a> – America’s most famous preacher at the time – found a lively reception along this “<a href=\"https://press.syr.edu/supressbooks/1604/listen-for-lonesome-drum/\">psychic highway</a>,” as one author later dubbed upstate New York.</p>\n\n<p>Some denominations, <a href=\"https://exploregeneseevalley.com/entries/burned-over-how-methodism-and-the-second-great-awakening-shaped-the-genesee-valley/5d9d8891-69cb-4b5a-8e76-1a8fa42a5cb0\">like the Methodists</a>, grew dramatically. But the “Burned-Over District” also gave birth to new churches after the canal’s creation. Joseph Smith <a href=\"https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints\">founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, often known as Mormons, in Fayette, New York, in 1830. The teachings of <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/amprophesy.html\">William Miller</a>, who lived near the Vermont border, spread west along the canal route – the roots of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A faded black-and-white illustration of a small crowd in front of a speaker's stand in a clearing amid trees.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/694728/original/file-20251007-56-u5wg2l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=579&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A camp revival meeting of the Methodists , circa 1829.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/camp-meeting-of-the-methodists-in-north-america-c-1829-news-photo/959938322?adppopup=true\">Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Door to the West</h2>\n\n<p>As Clinton predicted, the Erie Canal was “<a href=\"https://history.nycourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/finch_history.pdf\">a bond of union</a> between the Atlantic and Western States,” uniting upstate New York and the agrarian frontier of the Midwest to the urban markets of the Eastern seaboard. </p>\n\n<p>In the mid-1820s, Ohio Gov. Ethan Allen Brown <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ohio_State_Archaeological_and_Historical/N_wKAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22veins+and+arteries+to+the+body+politic%22&amp;pg=PA141&amp;printsec=frontcover\">praised America’s canals</a> “as veins and arteries to the body politic” and commissioned <a href=\"https://chpl.org/blogs/post/throwback-thursday-take-a-trip-on-the-miami-and-erie-canal/\">two canals of his own</a>: one to link the Ohio River to the Erie Canal, completed in 1832; and another to link the Miami River, completed in 1845. These canals in turn connected to numerous smaller waterways, creating an extensive network of trade and transportation.</p>\n\n<p>Like New York, Ohio had its canal towns, <a href=\"https://www.middletownhistoricalsociety.com/canalbicentennial\">including Middletown</a>: the birthplace of Vice President JD Vance and a city emblematic of America’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/revisiting-middletown-ohio-the-midwestern-town-at-the-heart-of-jd-vances-hillbilly-elegy-234975\">shifting industrial fortunes</a>. </p>\n\n<p>While America’s canal boom brought prosperity, this wealth <a href=\"https://eriecanalway.org/learn/history-culture/native-americans\">came at a cost to many Indigenous communities</a> – a cost that is only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/nyregion/erie-canal-bicentennial.html?searchResultPosition=1\">slowly being acknowledged</a>. The Haudenosaunee, often known by the name “Iroquois,” especially paid the price for the Erie Canal. The confederacy of tribes was pressured into ceding lands to the state of New York, and further displaced by ensuing frontier settlement.</p>\n\n<h2>Past and future</h2>\n\n<p>As the U.S. nears its 250th birthday on July 4, 2026, the <a href=\"https://america250.org/\">official website</a> of this commemoration urges Americans “to pause and reflect on our nation’s past … and look ahead toward the future we want to create for the next generation and beyond.”</p>\n\n<p>As the recent <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-a-quick-compromise-to-the-first-government-shutdown-in-nearly-7-years-seems-unlikely-266450\">federal government shutdown</a> suggests, however, the nation’s political system is struggling. </p>\n\n<p>Overcoming gridlock demands bipartisan consensus on basic concerns. Technology changes, but the demands of infrastructure – from <a href=\"https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/03/infrastructures-upward-momentum-reflected-in-report-card\">rebuilding roads and bridges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/closing-digital-divide-millions-americans-without-broadband\">expanding broadband</a> and sustainable energy networks – and the will needed to address them, persist.

These environments are generally hostile to human and equipment health, so designing and executing these missions requires a lot of planning, testing and technological development. </p>\n\n<p>You may have heard about the extensive <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/setmo/facilities/\">testing facilities for spacecraft and equipment</a>, but how do scientists prepare for the human aspect of space exploration? </p>\n\n<p>One way to test out techniques and identify situations that may arise during a real mission is using a simulation, which in this field is more commonly <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/analog-missions/\">known as an analog</a>. Researchers choose and design analog missions and environments to replicate elements of a real mission, using what is available here on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>These missions are conducted in extreme environments on Earth that are comparable to the Moon or Mars, in habitats designed to replicate living quarters, or a combination of both. Researchers can use analogs to study crew performance and procedures, or to test instruments <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM7OdOiElbk\">under development for use in space</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, operating a drill or wrench may seem easy here on Earth, but try doing the same task in thick gloves on a bulky, pressurized space suit in lower gravity. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasa-innovative-tools-for-an-out-of-this-world-job/\">Suddenly, things aren’t so straightforward</a>. Testing these scenarios on Earth allows researchers to identify necessary changes before launch. The analogs can also train crew members who will one day undertake the actual mission. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a planetary scientist, which means I study the geology of other planets. Currently, I study environments on Earth that are similar to other planets to improve our understanding of their counterparts elsewhere in the solar system. I participated as a volunteer in one of these analog missions as an “analog astronaut,” serving as the crew geologist and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ww-fObYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">applying my prior research findings</a> from studying the <a href=\"https://npp.orau.org/experiences/jordan-bretzfelder.html\">surfaces of the Moon and Mars</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These analog missions vary in setting, length and intensity, but all aim to learn more about the human factors involved in space exploration. </p>\n\n<h2>Where do we send them?</h2>\n\n<p>Analog missions are designed to simulate the crew’s experience in a given mission plan. In some cases, they simulate surface operations on the Moon or Mars for up to a year. Others might replicate the experience of being in transit to Mars for a period of time, followed by the crew “landing” and exploring the surface.</p>\n\n<p>NASA uses several analog mission facilities spread across the world. For example, the <a href=\"https://mars-desert-research-station.raisely.com/MDRS\">Mars Desert Research Station</a> in Utah is located in an environment chosen to imitate conditions on Mars, while <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/neemo/about-neemo-nasa-extreme-environment-mission-operations/\">analog missions at Aquarius</a>, an undersea research station off the coast of Florida, help scientists learn about crew behavior and psychology in a confined habitat located in a hostile environment.</p>\n\n<p>Some natural environments are commonly used for analog operations, such as <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasa-field-geology-training-prepares-artemis-mission-support-teams/\">volcanic terrains</a> in the western U.S., <a href=\"https://st.llnl.gov/news/look-back/apollo-astronauts-train-nevada-test-site\">human-made craters in Nevada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZwa5kEaNTY\">natural meteor crater in Arizona</a> <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/antarctic-stations/\">and research stations in Antarctica</a>. These locations mirror the geologic settings the crews are likely to encounter on future missions, and so training in these locations helps them execute the actual missions. </p>\n\n<p>I participated in a simulated 28-day lunar surface mission at a facility called <a href=\"https://www.hi-seas.org\">Hi-SEAS</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.sift.net/research/computational-social-science/medulla\">a study on crew dynamics and psychology</a> in extreme isolation. The facility is located on Mauna Loa, a volcano on the big island of Hawaii. This habitat has been used for a variety of studies, as the volcanic terrain is reminiscent of both the Moon and parts of Mars, and the isolated location simulates being in space. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A series of photos showing a dome-shaped habitat; a circular window; a circular doorway labeled 'airlock'; a room full of cabinets and appliances labeled 'laboratory'; a stairwell and elliptical; and a room with a small bed labeled 'cabins'\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=423&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/693958/original/file-20251001-56-5xnjzf.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=532&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The HI-SEAS Habitat, which recreates the conditions of living and working on the Moon, is located in Mauna Loa, Hawaii.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jordan Bretzfelder</span></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Analog mission crews</h2>\n\n<p>Most missions require applicants to hold relevant degrees.

We practiced emergency procedures and were taught how to perform other tasks. </p>\n\n<p>After that orientation, we were deployed to the habitat for 28 days. We turned in our phones to mission control and could only access the internet to check emails or use a few preapproved websites required for our daily duties.

They included individual assessments – similar to a daily IQ test – and group computer-based tasks, <a href=\"https://www.sift.net/demos/medulla-cubecrusher\">such as team 3D Tetris</a>. The researchers remotely monitored our interactions during these activities, and the results were analyzed as the mission progressed. They used our fluctuating performance on these activities as a proxy for estimating stress levels, group cohesion and individual well-being. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we went on two-to-three-hour extra-vehicular activities, or excursions outside the habitat, on alternating days. During these expeditions, we conducted geologic investigations on the volcano. On our “off days,” we spent two hours exercising in the habitat. We had to be fully suited in a mock spacesuit any time we went outside, and we had to be careful about the airlock procedures. We were never outdoors alone. </p>\n\n<p>We could only eat freeze-dried and powdered foods, aside from what we were able to grow in the hydroponic system. We had no additional food delivered during our stay. Water was also rationed, meaning we had to find innovative ways to maintain personal hygiene. For example, a bucket shower one or two times per week was allowed, supplemented by “wilderness wipe” baths. As someone with a lot of very curly hair, I was happy to figure out a method for managing it using less than two liters of water per week. We were also permitted to do laundry once during our stay, as a group. Sorting through your crewmates’ wet clothes was certainly one way to bond.</p>\n\n<p>Though physically demanding at times, the workload was not unreasonable. We were kept busy all day, as certain everyday tasks, such as cooking, required more effort than they might need in our normal lives. Preparing nutritionally balanced and palatable meals while rationing our very limited resources was hard, but it also provided opportunities to get creative with recipes and ingredients. We even managed to bake a cake for a crew member’s birthday, using peanut butter protein and cocoa powders to flavor it. </p>\n\n<p>After dinner each night, we shared the pre-saved movies and shows we had each brought with us into the habitat, as we could not access the internet. Those of us who had brought physical copies of books into the habitat would trade those as well. One crew member managed to acquire a downloadable form of <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/wordle-word-game-what-is-it-explained\">the daily Wordle</a>, so we could still compete with our friends back home. We also played board games, and all of these activities helped us get to know each other.</p>\n\n<p>Though different from our typical daily lives, the experience was one of a kind. We had the satisfaction of knowing that our efforts advanced space exploration in its own small way, one IQ test and slapdash cake at a time.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264658/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jordan Bretzfelder does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Feet and toes aren’t pointy, most of men’s shoes aren’t pointy, and they hurt my feet.” – Bunny, age 13, Mizpah, New Jersey</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While people’s actual feet are rounded on the end, women’s dress shoes often come to a sharp point at the toe. Many people also feel these pointy shoes are <a href=\"https://www.pointelles.com/blogs/think-you-can-t-wear-pointed-toe-shoes-why-you-might-reconsider-this-stylish-shoe-option/how-should-pointed-toe-shoes-fit\">uncomfortable to wear</a>.

Called <a href=\"https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/poulaine/\">poulaines – or cracows</a>, after the Polish city Kraków, where historians think they originated – these shoes could run as long as 12 inches in length. To keep the stiff, pointy shape, the wearer would <a href=\"https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/pointy-shoes-sexuality-medieval-london/\">stuff the ends of the shoes</a> with moss or wool. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Black shoes with long, pointed tips\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695021/original/file-20251008-57-se335g.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The pointy tip is the point for poulaines.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://nat.museum-digital.de/object/25887\">Deutsches Schuhmuseum Hauenstein</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Like most items of fashion, shoes <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/medieval-europeans-pointy-shoes\">signal the wearer’s status</a> to their peers. Poulaines were heavily decorated and expensive to make, and their elongated design made it difficult to move around. Thus, wearing poulaines communicated to others that the wearer was wealthy, having no need to perform physical work that required mobility.</p>\n\n<h2>Pointy shoes as status symbol</h2>\n\n<p>These shoes became so popular that in 1463 King Edward IV of England passed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vnl1evdkko\">laws limiting toe length</a> to 2 inches for anyone below a lord in social ranking. This decree had social, political and religious effects.</p>\n\n<p>Socially, restricting the longest-toed shoes to the nobility ensured the shoe would be a visual status marker associated with the upper classes. This obvious sign helped maintain social order and prevented lower-class people from trying to pass themselves off as higher in standing than they were.</p>\n\n<p>Politically, the king used this same legislation to <a href=\"https://boydellandbrewer.com/book/medieval-dress-and-textiles-in-britain-9781843839323/\">control the textile trade and protect English industries</a>. By regulating the fabrics and accessories necessary to make excessively ornate shoes, Edward IV could limit foreign competition with English textile manufacturers and at the same time manage fashion trends.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Painting depicting various aristocrats wearing pointy shoes at a banquet\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=431&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/695018/original/file-20251008-56-doqfne.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=542&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Only nobility got to enjoy the longest pointy shoes England could offer.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Renaud_de_Montauban.jpg\">Loyset Liédet (circa 1470)/Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>From a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/dress-clothing/Government-regulation-of-dress\">religious perspective</a>, King Edward IV passed these laws on the grounds that God was displeased by anything other than modest clothing – for the lower classes, anyway. Additionally, religious leaders believed that the long toes prevented people from kneeling in a respectful, submissive manner and so restricted the <a href=\"https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/pointy-shoes-sexuality-medieval-london/\">ability to properly pray</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The pressure to literally “fit in” to these pointy shoes also came with a physical cost. Poulaines hurt the wearer’s feet and could make their toe bones crooked. Bunions – a bony bump that develops on the inside of the foot at the big toe – <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fashion-for-pointy-shoes-unleashed-a-wave-of-bunions-in-medieval-england-162570\">became more common</a> with the popularity of these shoes.</p>\n\n<h2>Pain with a purpose</h2>\n\n<p>Various cultures have adopted pointy shoes throughout history, often to signify status, wealth or a connection to a specific subculture. A few examples include the <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-making-of-the-patiala-jutti-dastkari-haat-samiti/TAVx_OxWZxuiIg?hl=en\">juttis or khussas</a> of Northern India and Pakistan, respectively; the <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/books/every-step-a-lotus/paper\">lotus shoes</a> once popular in China; and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009151016.025\">pointed flat slippers</a> worn during the Etruscan civilization. </p>\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint, however, pointy-toed shoes can lead to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2021.04.012\">foot deformities</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.87.10.1677\">health problems</a>.

Like how early humans needed to stay with their tribe to survive, your brain thinks that being part of a group can help keep you safe.</p>\n\n<p>Because high-heeled, pointed shoes are commonly worn by women, wearing them gives the wearer feelings of acceptance from other women. While there is <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/beauty/the-bof-podcast-clothes-have-no-gender/\">nothing inherent</a> about pointy shoes that make them feminine or attractive – considering that they were often originally designed for men – fashion often relies on trends that people unconsciously agree on. What is stylish is often influenced by accepted social norms.</p>\n\n<p>Your brain also has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-use-mental-shortcuts-to-make-difficult-decisions-even-highly-trained-doctors-delivering-babies-168711\">clever shortcuts</a> to help you make decisions quickly. One shortcut is to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories-and-how-to-change-their-minds-82514\">look at what other people are doing</a>. If you see lots of people wearing a certain style or playing a particular game, your brain thinks, well, if everyone is doing this, it must be a good choice. This process helps you make decisions without having to think too hard about every little detail.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists call the powerful, mental influence fashion has on both the person wearing it and the people seeing their outfit <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.008\">enclothed cognition</a>. The shoes you wear may alter how you perceive yourself and others, as well as carry symbolic meaning. So designers might use elongated shoes to create the illusion of a long, slender silhouette to create a look that is not only seen but also personally felt as elegant and powerful.</p>\n\n<p>With new technology and an increased <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/footwear-purchasing-criteria#\">consumer desire for comfort</a>, the good news is that next time you get dressed and want to wear pointy, fashionable shoes, they may be at least a little less painful than they were in the past.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hello, curious kids!

The tales of ancient Egypt that emerged from Napoleon’s travels became a source of fascination to Americans, though in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>In the slaveholding South, ancient Egypt and its pharaohs became a way to justify slavery. For abolitionists and African Americans, biblical Egypt served as a symbol of bondage and liberation. </p>\n\n<p>As a historian, I study how 19th-century Americans – from Southern intellectuals to Black abolitionists – used ancient Egypt to debate questions of race, civilization and national identity. <a href=\"https://crulh.univ-lorraine.fr/membres/vanthournout-charles\">My research traces</a> how a distorted image of ancient Egypt shaped competing visions of freedom and hierarchy in a deeply divided nation.</p>\n\n<h2>Egypt inspires the pro-slavery South</h2>\n\n<p>In 1819, when lawyer <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/john-overton/\">John Overton</a>, military officer <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/james-winchester/\">James Winchester</a> and future president <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/andrew-jackson/\">Andrew Jackson</a> <a href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/memphis/\">founded a city in Tennessee</a> along the Mississippi River, they christened it Memphis, after the ancient Egyptian capital. </p>\n\n<p>While promoting the new city, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkbbg\">Overton declared</a> of the Mississippi River that ran alongside it: “This noble river may, with propriety, be denominated the American Nile.”</p>\n\n<p>“Who can tell that she may not, in time, rival … her ancient namesake, of Egypt in classic elegance and art?” <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn82007022/1849-11-06/ed-1/?sp=2&amp;q=A+Trip+to+Memphis+ancient+\">The Arkansas Banner excitedly reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the region’s fertile soil, <a href=\"https://ia801309.us.archive.org/23/items/proslaveryargume00phil/proslaveryargume00phil.pdf\">Chancellor William Harper</a>, a jurist and pro-slavery theorist from South Carolina, saw the promise of an agricultural empire built on slavery, one “capable of being made a far greater Egypt.” </p>\n\n<p>There was a reason pro-slavery businessmen and thinkers were energized by the prospect of an American Egypt: Many Southern planters imagined themselves as guardians of a hierarchical and aristocratic system, one grounded in landownership, tradition and honor. As Alabama newspaper editor <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moajrnl/acf2679.0030.006/405\">William Falconer</a> put it, he and his fellow white Southerners belonged to a “race that had established law, order, and government on earth.”</p>\n\n<p>To them, Egypt represented the archetype of a great hierarchical civilization. Older than Athens or Rome, Egypt conferred a special legitimacy. And just like the pharaohs, the white elites of the South saw themselves as the stewards of a prosperous society sustained by enslaved labor.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Colorful drawing of people loading bales of cotton onto steamboats.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=376&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697005/original/file-20251017-56-1he6yp.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=472&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The founders of Memphis named it after the ancient Egyptian capital, and they hoped the Mississippi River that ran alongside it would become an ‘American Nile.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/loading-cotton-onto-a-ship-memphis-tennessee-usa-c1900s-news-photo/463970447?adppopup=true\">The Print Collector/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>Leading pro-slavery thinkers like Virginia social theorist <a href=\"https://ia800209.us.archive.org/1/items/sociologyforsout00fitz/sociologyforsout00fitz.pdf\">George Fitzhugh</a>, South Carolina lawyer and U.S. Senator <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41698071\">Robert Barnwell Rhett</a> and Georgia lawyer and politician <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawof01cobbiala/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">Thomas R.R. Cobb</a> all invoked Egypt as an example to follow.</p>\n\n<p>“These [Egyptian] monuments show negro slaves in Egypt at least 1,600 years before Christ,” Cobb <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawof01cobbiala\">wrote in 1858</a>. “That they were the same happy negroes of this day is proven by their being represented in a dance 1,300 years before Christ.”</p>\n\n<h2>A distorted view of history</h2>\n\n<p>But their view of history didn’t exactly square with reality. Slavery did exist in ancient Egypt, but most slaves had been originally captured as prisoners of war.</p>\n\n<p>The country never developed a system of slavery comparable to that of Greece or Rome, and servitude was neither race-based nor tied to a plantation economy. The mistaken notion that Egypt’s great monuments were built by slaves largely stems from <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/herodotus-histories-loeb/Herodotus_Histories_Loeb/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">ancient authors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201&amp;version=NIV\">the biblical account of the Hebrews</a>. Later, popular culture – especially <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/\">Hollywood epics</a> – would continue to advance this misconception.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, 19th-century Southern intellectuals drew on this imagined Egypt to legitimize slavery as an ancient and divinely sanctioned institution.</p>\n\n<p>Even after the Civil War, which ended in 1865, nostalgia for these myths of ancient Egypt endured. In 1877, former Confederate officer <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/howworldwaspeopl00fontuoft/page/n5/mode/2up\">Edward Fontaine</a> noted how “Veritable specimens of black, woolyheaded negroes are represented by the old Egyptian artists in chains, as slaves, and even singing and dancing, as we have seen them on Southern plantations in the present century.”</p>\n\n<h2>Turning Egypt white</h2>\n\n<p>But to claim their place among the world’s great civilizations, Southerners had to reconcile a troubling fact: Egypt was located in Africa, the ancestral land of those enslaved in the U.S. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-right zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"A colorful drawing of a young queen with a gilded headdress being embraced from behind by a man wearing a gilded helmet.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=1074&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/697010/original/file-20251017-74-zom5eq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=1350&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">A collectible tobacco card depicts actors Claudette Colbert and Henry Wilcoxon in a still from the 1934 film ‘Cleopatra.’</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/collectible-tobacco-or-cigarette-card-shots-from-famous-news-photo/1306152870?adppopup=true\">Nextrecord Archives/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>In response, an intellectual movement called the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.pittstate.edu/etd/105/\">American School of Ethnology</a> – which promoted the idea that races had separate, unequal origins to justify Black inferiority and slavery – set out to “whiten” Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>In a series of texts and lectures, they portrayed Egypt as a slaveholding civilization dominated by whites. They pointed to Egyptian monuments as proof of the greatness that a slave society could achieve. And they also promoted a scientifically discredited theory called “<a href=\"https://www.history.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/History-of-the-Human-Sciences-2013-Keel-3-32.pdf\">polygenesis</a>,” which argued that Black people did not descend from the Bible’s Adam, but from some other source. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/evidenceagainstv1833colf/mode/2up?q=Egypt\">Richard Colfax</a>, the author of the 1833 pamphlet “Evidence Against the Views of the Abolitionists,” insisted that “the Egyptians were decidedly of the Caucasian variety of men.” Most mummies, he added, “bear not the most distant resemblance to the negro race.” </p>\n\n<p>Physician Samuel George Morton cited “<a href=\"https://ia801300.us.archive.org/35/items/craniaaegyptiac00mortgoog/craniaaegyptiac00mortgoog.pdf\">Crania Aegyptiaca</a>,” an 1822 German study of Egyptian skulls, to reinforce this view.  Writing in the Charleston Medical Journal in 1851, he explained how the German study had concluded that the skulls mirrored those of Europeans in size and shape.

Van Evrie</a> formed an effective triumvirate: Through press releases and public lectures featuring the skulls of mummies, they turned Egyptology into a tool of pro-slavery propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>“The Negro question was the one I wished to bring out,” <a href=\"https://books.google.fr/books/about/Pro_slavery_Thought_in_the_Old_South.html?hl=fr&amp;id=1dN2AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Nott wrote</a>, adding that he “embalmed it in Egyptian ethnography.”</p>\n\n<p>Nott and Gliddon’s 1854 bestseller “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/typesofmankindor01nott/page/n9/mode/2up\">Types of Mankind</a>” fused pseudoscience with Egyptology to both “prove” Black inferiority and advance the idea that their beloved African civilization was populated by a white Egyptian elite.</p>\n\n<p>“Negroes were numerous in Egypt,” they write, “but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is, that of servants and slaves.”</p>\n\n<h2>Denouncing America’s pharaohs</h2>\n\n<p>This distorted vision of Egypt, however, wasn’t the only one to take hold in the U.S., and abolitionists saw this history through a decidedly different lens.</p>\n\n<p>In the Bible, Egypt occupies a central place, mentioned repeatedly as a land of refuge – <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/143035/jewish/The-Story-of-Joseph-in-the-Bible.htm\">notably for Joseph</a> – but also as a nation of idolatry and as the cradle of slavery. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201&amp;version=NIV\">The episode of the Exodus</a> is perhaps the most famous reference. The Hebrews, enslaved under an oppressive pharaoh, are freed by Moses, who leads them to the Promised Land, Canaan. This biblical image of Egypt as a land of bondage deeply shaped 19th-century moral and political debates: For many abolitionists, it represented the ultimate symbol of tyranny and human oppression.</p>\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/emancipation-proclamation\">Emancipation Proclamation</a> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1863, <a href=\"https://books.google.fr/books?id=YHgv011kWIAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Black people could be heard</a> singing in front of the White House, “Go down Moses, way down in Egypt Land … Tell Jeff Davis to let my people go.” </p>\n\n<p>Black Americans seized upon this biblical parallel.

Now I teach a course at Rowan University on the history of organized crime, using the war as a case study, and I was a consultant on the Netflix series. </p>\n\n<p>The war pitted one faction of the Philadelphia mob, headed by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090413231924/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/22/us/jury-convicts-philadelphia-s-mob-leader.html\">Sicilian-born John Stanfa</a>, against a <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/11/21/Jury-convicts-Philadelphia-mob-boss/8470816930000/\">rival faction led by Joseph “Skinny Joey” Merlino</a>. The issues were control of all illegal operations in the underworld – gambling, loan-sharking, drug-dealing and extortion. Money was the bottom line, but there also was a cultural and generational divide that had Stanfa and, for the most part, his group of older wiseguys facing off against Merlino and his <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/joey-merlino-arrested-major-mob-bust/\">crew of young South Philadelphia-born mobsters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But only after indictments were handed down and evidence was introduced at trials did the extent of the electronic surveillance operation become known.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bWSDB6CHQ8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A trailer for ‘Mob War: Philadelphia vs. The Mafia’</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>‘Goodfellas kill goodfellas’</h2>\n\n<p>Mobsters, speaking in unguarded moments and unaware that the feds were listening, buried themselves.    </p>\n\n<p>So here was mob boss Stanfa discussing with an associate plans to lure Merlino and two of his two lieutenants to a meeting where they would be killed:</p>\n\n<p>“See, you no gotta give a chance,” the Sicilian-born Stanfa said in his halting English. “Bam, bam … Over here is best, behind the ear.”</p>\n\n<p>Or here was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWLJP0ndEVY\">Salvatore Profaci</a>, a New York mobster brought in to quietly settle a dispute that had gone public after mob lawyer <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/obituaries/20140205_Salvatore_J__Avena__87__branded_as_a_mob_lawyer.html\">Salvatore Avena</a> filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against his mobbed-up business partner in a trash-hauling business.</p>\n\n<p>“Goodfellas don’t sue goodfellas,” Profaci said in a line that couldn’t have been written any better by “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/04/27/archives/the-godfather-by-mario-puzo-446-pp-new-york-g-p-putnams-sons-695.html\">The Godfather</a>” author Mario Puzo or delivered more effectively by the award-winning actor <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/\">Robert De Niro</a>. “Goodfellas kill goodfellas.”</p>\n\n<p>The most staggering piece of the investigation, which was made known only after Stanfa and more than 20 of his associates had been indicted and arrested, was that the FBI had received court authorization to plant listening devices in the Camden, New Jersey, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/fbi-arrests-reputed-leader-of-philadelphia-mob-and-23-others.html\">law offices of Salvatore Avena</a>, Stanfa’s defense attorney.</p>\n\n<p>A judge approved the highly unusual authorization after the feds argued that Stanfa was using the shield of attorney-client privilege to conduct mob meetings in Avena’s office while a mob war raged on the streets of South Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia-1?variant=40971505106978\">More than 2,000 conversations were recorded</a> during the two-year electronic surveillance operation, with FBI agents and an assistant U.S. attorney manning a listening post in the basement of the federal courthouse a block away from Avena’s office. Whenever Stanfa and his associates got together, the feds were listening. Many of those conversations were then introduced as evidence at the racketeering trials that followed.  </p>\n\n<p>The conversations proved to be a treasure trove not only for investigators but also for journalists who covered the story as it unfolded and later got access to the tapes that were made public when the cases went to trial.</p>\n\n<h2>Blood in the streets</h2>\n\n<p>Two of the books I’ve written about the Philadelphia mob, “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-last-gangster-george-anastasia?variant=40973399883810\">The Last Gangster</a>” in 2004 and “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia?variant=40971505074210\">The Goodfella Tapes</a>” in 1998, are built around those tapes and the investigations they spawned.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who has written true crime knows that part of the problem with nonfiction storytelling is coming up with dialogue. In writing books about the Philadelphia mob wars that are the focus of the new Netflix series, that was never a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Mobsters from Philadelphia, South Jersey, New York and the Scanton-Wilkes Barre area of Pennsylvania ended up on the recordings, which offered not only details about the war but also included philosophical ramblings and personal asides that provided a glimpse into the world of organized crime as good as or better than any fictionalized story line from “The Godfather” or “The Sopranos.”</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the conflict, as bodies piled up and blood ran in the streets of the City of Brotherly Love, Stanfa and several of his associates were picked up <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-goodfella-tapes-george-anastasia?variant=40971505074210\">plotting murder and mayhem</a>, bemoaning the loss of honor and loyalty that had once been the hallmark of Cosa Nostra, and belittling their street-corner rivals, the “little Americans” who hadn’t a clue about what it meant to be a real mafioso.</p>\n\n<p>“When you’re a dwarf they could put you on a high mountain, you’re still a dwarf,” Avena told Stanfa in one of several conversations mocking Merlino and his associates.</p>\n\n<p>“I was born and raised in this thing (Cosa Nostra) and I’m gonna die in this thing,” said Stanfa at another point, bemoaning the state of the Philadelphia mob. “But with the right people. Over here is like kindergarten.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"Man wearing sunglasses stands in front of people holding video camera and microphones\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=466&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696593/original/file-20251015-56-o3dqxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=585&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Former Philadelphia mob boss ‘Skinny’ Joey Merlino, pictured here in 1997.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/NotRealNews/0a5bb7504d154b4dbc8672f1076f4c8b/photo\">AP Photo/H.

Several of his top associates were jailed for more than 20 years. In a second prosecution, Merlino and most of his top associates were <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/20141012__quot_That_s_Joey_Merlino_quot_.html\">convicted of racketeering</a> and jailed for sentences ranging from seven to 14 years. </p>\n\n<p>Dozens of conversations were played for the juries that sat in judgment during the racketeering trials that followed. Again and again the mobster’s own words were turned against them.</p>\n\n<p>Another highlight was an FBI surveillance video of a <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-215-9673nhvw\">mob hit picked up on a hidden camera</a> as it occurred. A surveillance camera located across the street from a deli run by then-Stanfa underboss Joseph Ciancaglini Jr. picked up the early morning shooting in which four shadowy figures burst into the deli and opened fire. An audio bug hidden inside the deli provided the sound effects – gunshots, shouting and the screams of a waitress. The shooting occurred shortly after 6 a.m. and just moments after Ciancaglini and his waitress had arrived and begun setting up for business.  </p>\n\n<p>Cooperating witnesses were also part of the trial, but defense attorneys frequently undermined their testimony by providing a litany of the crimes – often including murders – that the witnesses had admitted to as part of their plea deals.</p>\n\n<p>You can attack the credibility of a cooperating witness by focusing on his own crimes and his need to say whatever the government wants in order to win a lenient sentence, a defense attorney once explained to me. What you can’t do, he said, “is cross-examine a tape.”</p>\n\n<p>Jurors got to hear mobsters in their own words discussing the mob war. And there was nothing the defense could do to counterattack the impact of those words.</p>\n\n<p>One classic discussion underscored the mobsters’ concern about electronic surveillance and demonstrated their inability to do much about it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/09/27/Mob-trial-begins-in-Philadelphia/5051812174400/\">Stanfa consigliere Anthony Piccolo</a> was talking with Avena about the problem with cooperators and phone taps. Both men agreed it was important to be cautious. Avena then told Piccolo that he’d had an electronic anti-bugging expert come into his office over the weekend and had swept the rooms. It had cost him $500, Avena said.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s money well spent,” said Piccolo as the undetected FBI listening device beamed the conversation back to the listening post.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read more of our stories about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news\">Philadelphia and Pennsylvania</a>, or sign up for our Philadelphia <a href=\"https://tcphilly.substack.com/\">newsletter on Substack</a>.</em></p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267196/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>George Anastasia is the owner of G&amp;A Media LLC, the company through which he served as consultant for the series and through which he was paid, .  </span></em></p>",

Earlier in the year, a U.S. Navy destroyer <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/iran-navy-destroyer-iran-navy-blocks-us-destroyer-uss-fitzgerald-near-territorial-waters-what-happened/articleshow/122872499.cms?from=mdr\">bobbed along waters close to Iran</a> for similar reasons. And in the Taiwan Straits and Pacific, <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/09/11/chinas-newest-aircraft-carrier-sails-toward-taiwan-strait\">China</a> <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/09/16/u-s-u-k-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-pentagon-confirms\">and the U.S.</a> frequently show off their respective maritime military might.</p>\n\n<p>Close to 200 years after first being used to assert geopolitical dominance, <a href=\"https://www.thecollector.com/gunboat-diplomacy-military-power/\">gunboat diplomacy</a> is very much alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the tactics employed by the U.S., China and others today fit naval strategist James Cable’s <a href=\"https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_feb01ghp01.html\">classic formulation</a> for gunboat diplomacy as “the use or threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or avert loss.”</p>\n\n<p>The ships, boats and objectives have shifted since Cable first penned his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gunboatdiplomacy0000cabl_l5k2\">now-classic definition in 1971</a>, to be sure. But the core logic is the same: Conducted in tandem with political diplomacy, deploying state-of-the-art military vessels off or near a rival’s coast makes one hell of a statement.</p>\n\n<h2>Gunboat diplomacy sets sail</h2>\n\n<p>Gunboat diplomacy originally took shape in the mid-19th century during an era of industrial navies, imperial rivalry and weak international law. </p>\n\n<p>Steam power and heavy guns delivered mobility and shock, while diplomacy often happened via a few warships off a harbor, a short blockade or a punitive raid.

Anchoring in Tokyo Bay throughout 1853–54, they helped secure the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/treaty-of-kanagawa\">Treaty of Kanagawa</a> in 1854, forcibly opening the Japanese ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, during <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pacifico-david#:%7E:text=Pacifico%20demanded%20a%20sum%20of,incidents%20of%20mid%2DVictorian%20Britain.\">the Don Pacifico affair of 1850</a>, British navy squadrons pressured Greece to compensate a British subject.</p>\n\n<p>A half-century later, Britain, Germany and Italy united to <a href=\"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2019/4/30/the-venezuela-crisis-revisited\">impose a naval blockade on Venezuela</a>, seizing ships and customs houses to force the Venezuelan government to pay its foreign debts.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, a limited naval force was openly brandished at a chokepoint or capital to win a narrow concession and then withdraw.</p>\n\n<h2>Troubled postwar waters</h2>\n\n<p>After 1945, nuclear risk, alliance politics and evolving maritime law made traditional gunboat diplomacy less attractive – and riskier.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the method adapted.

Brown/Getty Images</a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Halloween is a fun, scary time for children and adults alike – but why does the holiday seem to start so much earlier every year? Decades ago, when I was young, Halloween was a much smaller affair, and people didn’t start preparing until mid-October. Today, in my neighborhood near where I grew up in Massachusetts, Halloween decorations start appearing in the middle of summer.</p>\n\n<p>What’s changed isn’t just when we celebrate but how: Halloween has evolved from a simple folk tradition to a massive commercial event. As a <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jay-zagorsky/%22%22\">business school professor</a> who has studied the economics of holidays for years, I’m astounded by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-halloween-spending-growing-when-americans-are-supposedly-cutting-back-242101\">how the business of Halloween has grown</a>. And understanding why it’s such big business may help explain why it’s creeping earlier and earlier.</p>\n\n<h2>The business of Halloween</h2>\n\n<p>Halloween’s roots lie in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/halloweens-celebration-of-mingling-with-the-dead-has-roots-in-ancient-celtic-celebrations-of-samhain-191300\">a Celtic holiday</a> honoring the dead, later <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/history-of-halloween%23section_3\">adapted by the Catholic Church</a> as a time to remember saints. Today it’s largely a secular celebration – one that gives people from all backgrounds a chance to dress up, engage in fantasy and safely confront their fears.</p>\n\n<p>That broad appeal has fueled explosive growth. The <a href=\"https://nrf.com/\">National Retail Federation</a> has <a href=\"https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween\">surveyed Americans about their Halloween plans</a> each September since 2005. Back then, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween/halloween-data-center\">slightly more than half of Americans said they planned to celebrate</a>. In 2025, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion\">nearly three-quarters</a> said they would – a huge jump in 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>And people are <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion\">planning to shell out</a> more money than ever. Total spending on Halloween is expected to reach a record US$13 billion this year, according to the federation – an almost fourfold increase over the past two decades. Adjusting for <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html\">population growth</a>, I found that the average American will spend an expected $38 on Halloween this year – up from just $18 per person back in 2005. That’s a lot of candy corn.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"ZtQxQ\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZtQxQ/4/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dataweb.usitc.gov/\">Candy imports</a> show a similar trend. September has long been the key month for the candy trade, with imports about one-fifth higher than during the rest of the year. Back in September 2005, the U.S. imported about $250 million of the sweet stuff. In September 2024, that figure had tripled to about $750 million.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of a larger trend of Halloween becoming a lot more professionalized. For example, when I was a kid, it wasn’t unusual for households to pass out brownies, candied apples and other homemade treats to trick-or-treaters. But because of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/halloween-safety-tips-costumes-candy-and-colored-contact-lenses\">safety concerns and food allergies</a>, for decades Americans have been warned to stick to mass-produced, individually wrapped candies.</p>\n\n<p>The same shift has happened with costumes. Years ago, many people made their own; today, store-bought costumes dominate — <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/half-a-billion-on-halloween-pet-costumes-is-latest-sign-of-americas-out-of-control-consumerism-125991\">even for pets</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Halloween keeps creeping earlier</h2>\n\n<p>While there’s no definitive research establishing why Halloween seems to start earlier each year, the increase in spending is one major driver.</p>\n\n<p>Halloween items are seasonal, which means no one wants to buy <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/giant-ground-breaking-skeleton.product.4000256751.html\">giant plastic skeletons</a> on Nov. 1. As total spending grows, retailers order more inventory, and the cost of storing ever-larger amounts of unsold items until the next year becomes a bigger consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Once a season’s commercial footprint becomes large enough, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1110.0693\">retailers begin ordering and displaying merchandise</a> long before it’s actually needed. For example, winter coats start appearing in stores in early fall and are typically gone when the snow starts falling. It’s the same with Halloween: Retailers put out merchandise early to ensure they’re not stuck with unsold goods once the season is over.</p>\n\n<p>They also often price strategically – charging full price when items first hit the shelves, appealing to eager early shoppers, and then marking down prices closer to the holiday. This clears shelves and warehouses, making room for the next upcoming shopping season.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past two decades, Halloween has become an ever-bigger commercial holiday. The growth in people enjoying the holiday and the increase in spending has resulted in Halloween becoming one giant treat for businesses. The big trick for retailers is preventing this holiday from starting before the Fourth of July.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267716/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Jay L.

Picture pixels in an image. The smaller the grid pieces, or cells, the higher the resolution and the more accurate the forecast. However, creating many small cells across a large area requires greater computing power, so forecasting storm surge takes longer as a result. </p>\n\n<p>Forecasters can use low-resolution computer grids to speed up the process, but that reduces accuracy, leaving communities with more uncertainty about their flood risk.</p>\n\n<p>AI can help speed that up.</p>\n\n<h2>How AI can create better forecasts</h2>\n\n<p>There are two main sources of uncertainty in storm surge predictions.</p>\n\n<p>One involves the data fed into the computer model. A hurricane’s storm track and wind field, which determine where it will make landfall and how intense the surge will be, are <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/pdfs/Verification_2024.pdf\">still hard to forecast</a> accurately more than a few days in advance. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3125-2023\">Changes to the coast and sea floor</a>, such as from channel dredging or loss of salt marshes, mangroves or sand dunes, can affect the resistance that storm surge will face.</p>\n\n<p>The second uncertainty involves the resolution of the computational grid, over which the mathematical equations of the surge and wave motion are solved. The resolution determines how well the model sees changes in landscape elevation and land cover and accounts for them, and at how much granularity the physics of hurricane surge and waves is solved.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=380&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/678438/original/file-20250706-56-hui81z.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=478&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Detailed storm surge models can provide more specific information about expected flood height.

For example, engineers and scientists have developed AI models <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD037617\">based on deep neural networks</a> that can predict water levels along the coastline quickly and accurately by using data about the wind field. In some cases, these models have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2024.104504\">been more accurate</a> than traditional hydrodynamic models.</p>\n\n<p>AI can also develop forecasts for areas with little historic data, or be used to understand extreme conditions that may not have occurred there before. </p>\n\n<p>For these forecasts, physics-based models can be used to generate synthetic data to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-015-2111-1\">train the AI</a> on scenarios that might be possible but haven’t actually happened. Once an AI model is trained on both the historic and synthetic data, it can quickly generate surge forecasts using details about the wind and atmospheric pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Training the AI on data from hydrodynamic models can also improve its ability to quickly generate inundation risk maps showing which streets or houses are likely to flood in extreme events that may not have a historical precedent but could happen in the future.  </p>\n\n<h2>The future of AI for hurricane forecasting</h2>\n\n<p>AI is <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/hurricane-forecast-ai-artificial-intelligence\">already being used</a> in operational storm surge forecasts in a limited way, mainly to augment the commonly used physics-based models.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to improving those methods, my team and other researchers have been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2024.104504\">developing ways to use AI</a> for storm surge prediction using observed data, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.12658\">assessing the damage after hurricanes</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2023.105939\">processing camera images to deduce flood intensity</a>. That can fill a critical gap in the data needed for validating storm surge models at granular levels.</p>\n\n<p>As artificial intelligence models rapidly spread through every aspect of our lives and more data becomes available for training them, the technology offers potential to improve hurricane and storm surge forecasting in the future, giving coastal communities faster and more detailed warnings about the risks on the way.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259007/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Navid Tahvildari&#39;s research on coastal flooding has been funded by NSF, NOAA, NASA, and DOT. </span></em></p>",
